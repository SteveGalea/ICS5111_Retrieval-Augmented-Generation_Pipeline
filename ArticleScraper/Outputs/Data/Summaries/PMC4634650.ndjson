{"summary": "1, 2, 3 Genetic and antigenic characterisation of the H1N1v virus showed it to be distinct from current seasonal H1N1 influenza A viruses circulating in humans. 8, 9 Swine influenza viruses (SIVs) circulating in pig herds include H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 subtypes. a triple reassortment H3N2 in 1998 contained genes of human, avian, and classical H1N1 swine influenza origin genes. 5, 12, 13 These triple reassortant variants of the H1N1 and H1N2 subtypes have been detected. 15, 16 SIVs are known to infect humans 17, 18 and poultry, 19, 20, 21, 22. highly sensitive and specific real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT PCR) technology has been exploited by veterinary institutes and reference laboratories to develop and validate appropriate tests for avian influenza viruses (AIVs) 28 These include validated RRT PCR tests for notifiable AI caused by H5 and H7 subtype viruses. ninetynine laboratory isolates of influenza A viruses were obtained from the influenza virus repository at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLAWeybridge) they were grown in 9 to 10dayold specificpathogenfree embryonated fowls\u2019 eggs (EFEs) and typed using standard protocols. these included 51 swine influenza virus isolates, 43 avian influenza virus isolates plus five H1N1v isolates.

primer to the \u201cRevmod\u201d primer used in the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR described in this study. the second variant (\u201ccombo\u201d M gene RRT PCR) included an equimolar mix of the original AIV reverse primer plus the above Revmod primer. otherwise cycling conditions, temperatures and chemistry details for both variants were as described for the M gene RRT PCR. the antisense hydrolysis probe (31 nucleotides long) was 1 118 prorev: FAM5\u2032 CTG GCT TCT TAC CTT TT*C ATA TAA GTT C3\u2032 [13771407], which was labelled with the FAM fluorophore at the 5\u2032 end and with black hole quencher (BHQ1) at an internal T nucleotide. the 3\u2032 terminal C nucleotide was modified to a did the M gene reverse primer was modified to match the target sequence for the two viruses. the final magnesium chloride concentration was 25 mm, with ROX and probes excluded. 34 Amplicons were purified after gel electrophoresis in 3% agarose. three HA gene alignments that included European SIV isolates of the H1N1 (avianlike swine), H1N2 and humanlike swine H3N2 subtypes were constructed using the Megalign software. the primerselect programme was then used to design appropriate primers to generate small (i.e. 230 bp) amplicons that were of sufficient size for sequencing and identification by BLAST searching. conventional RT PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% w/v agarose, purified and sequenced. these conventional RT PCR products were similarly designed to amplify portions of the HA gene of European H1N1 (avianlike swine) and humanlike H3N2 SIVs. the sequence for the forward M gene RRT PCR primer remains highly conserved for most isolates. the detection limit corresponded to a viral titre of 1 101 EID50/ml for the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene and \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCRs. the detection limit corresponded to a viral titre (preRNA extraction) of 1 101 EID50/ml for the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene and \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCRs. the \u201cavian\u201d M gene RRT PCR was most sensitive as this test yielded the lowest threshold cycle (Ct) value followed by \u201ccombo\u201d RRT PCR, but the \u201cavian\u201d M gene RRT PCR was clearly the least sensitive with the highest Ct values. fiftyone laboratory isolates of established SIVs were divided into five categories based on combinations of subtype and temporal and geographical origin. however, when 35 contemporary UK and European SIVs were tested, the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR was the most sensitive for detecting 34 of the isolates. the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR assay would be the most sensitive to use for generic testing of contemporary European SIVs as well as any pig infections caused by H1N1v. for North American pigs, the \u201ccombo\u201d M gene RRT PCR provided the most sensitive approach to generic testing for 13 of 14 North American isolates. the \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR assay was designed specifically for differential detection of H1N1v influenza A viruses. none of the 37 European SIV laboratory isolates, including the 22 H1N1 (20 avianlike swine and two classical) and eight H1N2 SIVs, were detected by the \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR assay. \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR testing of both North American H1N2 isolates also produced the 118 bp band of predicted size. noninfluenza A viruses The 14 noninfluenza A viruses were tested by the three M gene RRT PCR assays and by the \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR assay. pigs infected with avianlike swine H1N1 viruses between 1992 and 2008, six from pigs with H1N2 virus infections from 1994 to 2009 and seven from pigs infected with humanlike swine H3N2 virus during 1991\u20131994. no Ct value was obtained by the \u201cavian\u201d M gene RRT PCR with three further samples. sixtysix archived tissue specimens from pigs were tested by the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR assay to assess its specificity. all gave \u201cNo Ct\u201d results except one, which produced a Ct value of 2545 by the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR. fifteen (six swabs and nine tissues) received between September and November 2009 from nine geographically diverse pig herds. these and a further 24 specimens (18 swabs and six tissues) were tested by both the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene and \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCRs. twentytwo of the 24 swabs were positive by both RRT PCRs. with H1N1v 36, 23 clinical specimens were tested by VI, the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR assay and the \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR assay. these samples included 23 nasal swabs taken between 1 and 7 dpi, and postmortem tissues (lung, n = 5; thoracic trachea, n = 5). the sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene and \u201cH1118\u201d five results were VI negative, but \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR positive. sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 991% was determined. only one swab, obtained from an experimentally infected pig at 7 dpi, was VI negative. three archived tissues from pigs that were VI positive gave negative results by \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR. one archived tissue was positive by \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR but VI negative (Table 7a). when the same tissues were tested by \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR assay, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were both 100%. the reverse primer has extensive variability at primarily five different positions for H1N1v and SIV isolates compared to the \u201cavian\u201d M gene RRT PCR primers and probes originally designed by Spackman et al. current SIVs and H1N1v isolates have from zero to four nucleotide mismatches in the reverse primer. this influenced the design of the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR \u201cRevmod\u201d primer for H1N M gene RRT PCR at these Ct values was 200 RNA copies and 2000 RNA copies for the H1N1v and H3N2 targets respectively. this discrepancy may relate to differences in the M gene reverse primer binding sequence for the two influenza A viruses. the \u201cavian\u201d M gene RRT PCR was the least sensitive with the highest Ct values (Table 1). in the case of A/swine/N Ireland/1012/09, the \u201cavian\u201d M gene RRT PCR failed to detect this RNA sample, presumably due to it being of low titre (Table 1). the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR assay was the least sensitive for detection of the 14 North American SIVs. the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR assay was the least sensitive for detection of the 14 North American SIVs. the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR assay was the most sensitive to use for generic testing of contemporary European SIVs as well as any pig infections caused by H1N1v. weden/08, H7N7) was so highly diluted that a high Ct value (3686) was obtained with the \u201cavian\u201d M gene RRT PCR, but \u201cNo Ct\u201d registered by both the \u201cperfect match\u201d and \u201ccombo\u201d M gene RRT PCR assays. the \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR assay was used to test 94 SIV and AIV isolates plus five H1N1v isolates. a degree of conservation was observed in the primer binding sequences for the \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR. mismatches in the probebinding region appeared to account for the failure to generate fluorescence signals. noninfluenza A viruses The 14 noninfluenza A viruses were tested by the three M gene RRT PCR assays. the 31 tissues from positive pigs included 18 tissues from pigs infected with avianlike swine H1N1 viruses between 1992 and 2008. six from pigs with H1N2 virus infections from 1994 to 2009 and seven from pigs infected with humanlike swine H3N2 virus during 1991\u20131994. all 31 archived tissue samples from SIVnegative pigs were negative by the \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR assay. only four of these archived tissues were VI positive during the current validation study. repeat VI testing failed to recover viable influenza A virus from this specimen. investigation by conventional RT PCR and sequencing revealed an H1 gene that was suggestive of H1N2 SIV. twentytwo of the 24 swabs were positive by both RRT PCRs. one swab from the Norwegian herd gave \u201cNo Ct\u201d by both RRT PCRs. 11 nasal swabs from the same herd gave similar positive Ct values by both tests. the 15 tissues were all positive by both tests, with Ct values of 2084\u20133317 and 2089\u20133284 for the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene and \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR assays. for 249 clinical specimens, confirmatory results were available either as VI, or in case of 15 H1N1v field specimens, through independent confirmation by amplicon sequencing. with this assay, there were five results that were VI negative, but \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR positive (Table 6a). archived tissues from pigs that were VI positive gave negative results by \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR. one archived tissue was positive by \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR but VI negative (Table 7a). assay 38 has gained widespread acceptance as a validated method for the global detection of all AIV subtypes. the highly conserved nature of the M gene in all influenza A viruses led to the M gene RRT PCR being considered as a candidate for an initial screening assay for detecting pigs infected with all SIVs, including any infections because of H1N1v. the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR demonstrated successful detection of contemporary European SIVs in archived tissues from infected pigs. however, the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR successfully detected both H1N1v laboratory isolates and clinical specimens from pigs that had been infected with H1N1v in the field (Table 3) and experimentally (Table 4). the 96 UK archived swine tissues were classified as SIV positive or negative at the time of original submission based on VI. three of the 31 tissues from SIVpositive pigs were negative (No Ct) by the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR, negative by \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR. the H1118 RRT PCR assay was designed for the differential detection of H1N1v infections of pigs. it successfully detected five H1N1v laboratory isolates and the presence of H1N1v in 48 clinical specimens (29 swabs and 19 postmortem tissues) it was also shown that the H1 genes from nine H1 AIVs, 30 European H1 SIVs were not detected by this assay. for the \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR using tissue samples, both the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of this assay were 100%. five clinical specimens from H1N1vfieldinfected pigs were independently proven as H1N1v positive by conventional RT PCR and amplicon sequencing because VI was not consistently successful for the identification of H1N1v. this is because H1N1v does not consistently haemagglutinate chicken red blood cells, which may not be observed the \u201cH1118\u201d RRT PCR assay was most sensitive for generic detection. this method was slightly less sensitive for the detection of H1N1v than the \u201cperfect match\u201d M gene RRT PCR assay. validation involved testing of a range of laboratorygrown influenza A virus isolates. 5N1 highly pathogenic AIV prompted the validation of a H5 RRT PCR for the detection of both this H5 virus and other Eurasian H5 AIVs. authors thank all laboratories that supplied specimens of swine influenza and pandemic
