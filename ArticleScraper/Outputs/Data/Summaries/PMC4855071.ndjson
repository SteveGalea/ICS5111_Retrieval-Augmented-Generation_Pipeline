DNA immunization is more useful than traditional approaches to generating mAbs against more difficult targets, especially membrane proteins. the current review provides a comprehensive summary of the literature that has accumulated over the past two decades. production of functionally active mAbs is highly dependent on the conformation of the proteins. DNA vaccines possess the unique advantage of immunogen design flexibility. native proteins have been used as DNA vaccine immunogen inserts. DNA immunization offers a wide range of options to produce novel immunogen inserts for the induction of mAbs against even the most challenging targets. the choice of reagents and methods depends on the original type of protein (Table 2). a novel western screening method was developed and optimized to generate monoclonal antibodies against nuclear, cytoplasmic and transmembrane proteins. a novel in-cell Western screening method was developed and optimized to generate monoclonal antibodies against nuclear, cytoplasmic and transmembrane proteins. expression in vivo has a major impact on the induction of high-quality mAbs. the relative efficacy of CMV promoter and the human ubiquitin C promoter was compared using luciferase as the model immunogen. a single HTV delivery of the ubiquitin promoter produced very low antibody titers over the same time frame. the recombinant protein method can circumvent these problems because full-length proteins can be expressed in vivo when they are delivered in the form of DNA vaccines. production of functionally active mAbs is highly dependent on the conformation of the proteins. a truncated fragment can be used for immunization in place of a full-length potentially lethal toxin protein, thereby avoiding the introduction of unwanted biological activity during the production of DNA vaccines. 39 Additional immunogen manipulations include the production of a \u2018mini-gene insert' to express a short peptide sequence to cover a receptor-binding domain. cell-associated antigen-based screening has been widely used for mAbs targeting transmembrane proteins, viral envelope proteins and intracellular proteins. cell-associated antigen-based screening has been widely and successfully used for mAbs targeting transmembrane proteins. the design of commonly used DNA vaccine vectors has been significantly optimized. it has been established that the promoter region of these DNA vaccine vectors is their most critical element. the selection of poly-A tail is also important, as is optimized codon usage. the immunogenicity results showed that the chicken beta actin promoter induced a higher antigen-specific immune response with HTV delivery. the chicken beta actin promoter induced a higher antigen-specific immune response with HTV delivery, even when the plasmid was injected less frequently. gene gun and electroporation delivery were more effective than the traditional intramuscular needle injection at eliciting higher antibody response levels. the gene gun approach requires only a few micrograms of DNA plasmid to achieve the same level of immune response elicited by the electroporation approach. two- transmembrane (P2X7) 24 GPI anchored enzyme 43 Intracelluar (BCL-6) 31 Intracelluar (MALT1) 32 Single transmembrane (MHCI-related gene A) 34 Parasite lipoprotein 55 Viral envelop (HIV gp120) 37 IM Bacteria toxin (Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cyto toxin) 38 Seven transmembrane, G ine kinase 3 receptor, Flt-3R;

mAbs generated were used for fluorescence-activated cell sorting, western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. more studies are needed to further optimize the DNA immunization schedule to elicit high-quality antibodies. early generation gene guns created ballistic forces by adding high-voltage electricity to a drop of water. more recent generation gene guns are based on the release of compressed gas. another physical method of DNA delivery is electroporation. mAbs are elicited by the gene gun approach;22, 24, 31, 32, 33, 34, 37, 43, 55, 57, 58 needle injection. intramuscular19, 20, 23, 38, 41, 44,45,46, 48, 49, 50 or intradermal21, 35, 42 injection. monocellular matrix and plasma glycoprotein (Fibulin-1) 42 Single transmembrane (CD2) 35 IM followed by EP Seven transmembrane, GPCR (CCX-CKR) 27 Viral envelop (H5N1) 52 Secretory (mCherry) 56 Viral envelop (H1) 53 Bacteria toxin (C. difficile toxin A) 39 ID followed by EP Multiple targets (transmembrane, intracellular) the author generated hybridomas by fusing spleen cells at 2, 3, 5, 10 and 25 days after a single intrasplenic injection of DNA vaccine plasmids. the highest number of specific hybridomas was generated at day 5 after a single intrasplenic injection. more studies are needed to further optimize the DNA immunization schedule to elicit high-quality mAbs. it is important to determine whether different delivery approaches are optimal with certain delivery schedules and whether the same delivery schedule can be applied to different animal species. mAbs against a different GPCR target, the chemoCentryx chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR) were generated by the co-immunization of a plasmid encoding GroEL with a DNA vaccine plasmid-encoding target. a more complicated immunization strategy was tested, in which a plasmid encoding fetal liver tyrosine kinase 3 ligand was delivered as the DNA prime-protein boost approach has been used to generate mAbs in both mouse and rabbit models. this approach was effective in generating a panel of mAbs that are protective against Clostridium difficile toxin A challenge, as well as mAbs for use as sensitive reagents to detect toxin A in various testing samples. mAb targets for mAb induction.27, 65 The authors reported that DNA immunization in mice with a plasmid encoding the full-length endothelin A receptor (ETAR+GroEL) induced strong, specific antibody responses to native ETAR. no specific antibody responses were produced in mice that were immunized with ETAR. DNA primer immunization was more effective than protein immunization in activating germinal center B cells. higher levels of antigen-specific B cells set the stage for more robust antibody responses. mAbs by the traditional hybridoma method requires the availability of many activated antigen-specific B cells in lymphoid organs for fusion. this is achieved by a final intravenous or intraperitoneal injection 3\u20135 days before fusion. however, the overall fusion efficiency was low, and the resulting antibodies had low binding affinity. cells expressing antigen proteins have been used directly as the final boost. this approach was successful for both membrane proteins19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 35, 48, 49 and intracellular proteins. inactive viral particles have been used successfully as the final boost. DNA immunization is an efficient method of testing different immunogen designs. immunization does not require the production or purification of proteins from a pathogen, which avoids issues related to biosafety."}
