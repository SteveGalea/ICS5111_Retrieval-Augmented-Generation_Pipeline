{"summary": "porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a small, enveloped virus, including a single positive-strand RNA genome. it is a member of the family Arteriviridae, which is classified in the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh 1997; Meulenberg 2000) it is characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs. the activation of IRF-3 needs its phosphorylation by 2 noncanonical IB kinases, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and the noncanonical IB kinases (IKK-) during the coevolution with the host cells, many viruses have developed defensive mechanisms to inhibit IFN- production. nsp2 is a membrane-anchored protein that contains a 3C-like cysteine protease activity that inhibited IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. nsp2 contains a domain designated the NendoU domain and functions as an endoribonuclease. nsp1 possessed 3 parts: an amino-terminal zinc-finger (ZF) domain. pcDNA3.1-TRIF, p-284 Luc (positions 284 and +19 in the IFN- gene before the luciferase report gene), pcDNA3.1-FLAG, pcDNA3.1- FLAG -nsp1 and phRL-TK have already been described. the nsp1 ZF domain mutants, nsp1Cys-8Ala (nsp1C8A) and nsp all constructs were fully sequenced. lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transient transfection. cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected in triplicate with the p-284 Luc plasmid. luciferase activity measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system. cell extracts and immunoblotting MARC-145 cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected in triplicate with the various expression plasmids. 48h later, transfected cells were lysed in a lysing buffer. the plasmids pcDNA3.1-VISA, pcDNA3.1-TRIF, p-284 Luc (positions 284 and +19 in the IFN- gene before the luciferase report gene), pcDNA3.1-FLAG, pcDNA3.1- FLAG -nsp1 and phRL-TK have already been described. p55C1B Luc (Yoneyama and others 1996, 2004; Devaraj and others 2007), a firefly luciferase reporter gene plasmid containing repetitive pIRF-3-binding sites, was provided by Dr. Takashi Fujita. all constructs were fully sequenced. cell extracts and immunoblotting MARC-145 cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected in triplicate with the various expression plasmids. the total protein concentration was quantified with the Bradford protein assay (Biocolor Bioscience & Technology Company) mutant that deleted the ZF domain in nsp1 failed to inhibit the induction of IFN- nsp1 contained 3 parts: the N-terminal ZF domain (Met1-Glu65), the PCP domain (pro66 to Gln166), and the C-terminal extension (CTE; Arg167 to Met180) western blots analyzed the expression of nsp1 and nsp1 66\u2013180 (nsp1 DZF) MARC-145 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1-FLAG (Vector), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-nsp1 (nsp1) or pcDNA3.1-FLAG-nsp1 66\u2013180 (nsp1 DZF) twenty hours later, cells were either mock-treated (Con) or transfected with poly (I:C) p55C1B-Luc was in place of p-284 Luc. mutation that deleted the ZF domain in nsp1 could not suppress IFN- promoter activation induced by overexpression of VISA, TRIF, or IKK-. V nsp1 belonged to the 4-Cys ZF superfamily (Tijms and others 2001; Sun and others 2009) and the Cys8, Cys10, Cys25, and Cys28 participated in binding with the zinc ion (Sun and others 2009) the nsp1 mutants that mutagenesis of the predicted zinc-coordinating residues of the ZF domain failed to inhibit the activities of the IFN- promoter (p-284 Luc) and the MARC-145 cells were transfected with p-284 Luc (E) or p55C1B Luc (F), phRL-TK, and different expression plasmids. twenty hours later, the cells were harvested for the dual luciferase reporter assay. the ZF domain of nsp1 was not sufficient to inhibit the induction of IFN- since the ZF domain only contained 65 amino acids. we fused the ZF domain to a new tag protein GFP, the molecular weight of which was about 25 kiloDalton (kDa) both nsp1 and nsp1 ZF localized in the nucleus, but also some of them retained in the cytoplasm. western blots analyzed the expression of nsp1 and nsp1 1\u201365 (nsp1 ZF) by an anti-GFP antibody in MARC-145 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-GFP (Vector), pcDNA3.1-GFP-nsp1 (GFP-nsp1) and different expression plasmids. twenty hours later, cells were either mock-treated (Con) or transfected with poly mutant that deleted the ZF domain in nsp1 failed to inhibit the induction of IFN- nsp1 contained 3 parts: the N-terminal ZF domain (Met1-Glu65), the PCP domain (PCP domain, Pro66 to Gln166), and the C-terminal extension (CTE; Arg167 to Met180) western blots analyzed the expression of nsp1 and nsp1 66\u2013180 (nsp1 D MARC-145 cells were cotransfected with p-284 Luc (B) or p55C1B Luc (E), phRL-TK, and different expression plasmids. twenty hours later, cells were either mock-treated (Con) or transfected with poly (I:C) for 6 h, then the cells were harvested for the dual luciferase reporter assay. TLR3 recruited TRIF, and MDA5 recruited VISA, to phosphorylate IRF-3. overexpression of VISA, TRIF, or IKK- could induce the activation of IRF-3 and activate the IFN- promoter. nsp1 mutants that mutagenesis of predicted zinc-coordinating residues of the ZF domain failed to inhibit the activities of the IFN- promoter (p-284 Luc) and the pIRF-3-dependent promoter (p55C1B Luc) mutagenesis of the predicted zinc-coordinating residues of the ZF domain failed to inhibit the activities of the IFN- promoter (p-284 Luc) the cells were harvested for the dual luciferase reporter assay. data represented means of 3 replicates, and experiments were repeated 3 times. the ZF domain of nsp1 was not sufficient to inhibit the induction of IFN- since the ZF domain only contained 65 amino acids. we fused the ZF domain to a new tag protein GFP, the molecular weight of which was about 25 kiloDalton (kDa) both nsp1 and nsp1 ZF mainly localized in the nucleus, but also some retained in the cytoplasm. western blots analyzed the expression of nsp1 and nsp1 1\u201365 (nsp1 ZF) by an anti-GFP antibody in MARC-145 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-GFP (Vector), pcDNA3.1-GFP-nsp1 (GFP-nsp1), or pcDNA3.1-GFP-nsp1 (GFP-nsp1). twenty hours later, previous studies have shown that nsp1 inhibited the production of IFN- by suppression of NF-B and inhibition of the phophosphorylation of IRF-3 in the absence of other genes. however, it remains to be determined exactly how nsp1 antagonized the production of IFN-. nsp1 contained 3 parts: the N-terminal ZF domain (Met1-Glu65), the PCP domain (Pro66 to Gln166), and the C-terminal extension (CTE; Arg167 to Met180) nsp1 contained 3 parts: the N-terminal ZF domain (Met1-Glu65), the PCP domain (PCP domain, Pro66 to Gln166), and the C-terminal extension (CTE; Arg167 to Met180 the nsp1 domain encoded by PRRSV was essential for nsp1 to inhibit the production of IFN- induction. however, the precise mechanism that the nsp1 domain was essential for nsp1 to inhibit the production of IFN- warranted further investigation. the Key Program National Natural Science Foundation of China. no competing financial interests exist."}
