{"summary": "the human immunodeficiency Virus type one (HIV-1) is the major causing pathogen of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) a large number of HIV-1-related studies are based on three non-human models: chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, and mouse. however, the differences in host-HIV-1 interactions between human and these model organisms have remained unexplored. studies of host-virus interactions may help unravel host/viral factors key to these central themes in infectious disease studies. AIDS is barely life-threatening to chimpanzees, human's closest relative in the nature. chimpanzee (Pan troglodyte), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and mouse (Mus musculus) are all important animal models for HIV studies. understanding the differences in host-virus interplay between human and the model species is the basis for correct interpretation of animal-based HIV studies. the human-chimpanzee-macaque-mouse orthologous proteins were downloaded from the HIV-1 genome browser (release 47) 77 proteins had no Ensembl-identified orthologues in all of the three compared species. chimpanzee and macaque genomic sequences were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser. in the case of indels, the quality scores of the 15 nucleotides on either side of the indel were averaged. the potential protein interaction hot sites were identified using 3D-partner. we classified these interactions into 7 major groups based on 65 key phrases from the HIV-1, Human Protein Interaction Database. the classification of interaction key phrases can be found online at http://bioinfo-dbb.nhri.org.tw/capih/keyphrases.php. each of the hominoids still has more than 950 species-specific PTM events. rhesus macaque has 4,600 species-specific PTM events. chimpanzee is highly resistant to developing AIDS while the other two are not. the user can also look up the proteins of interest in the protein table. all the proteins that match the query key word will be shown with a plus \"+\" sign in front (Figure 2B). the diagram gives species-specific variations in amino acid sequences, interpro-predicted protein domains, CDSs, 3'UTR, and 5' UTR (in the top-down direction) each filled block represents 10 variations, that is, 10 nucleotide substitutions (for CDS and UTRs), amino acid changes (for amino acid and IPR domains), indels, or PTMs. the user can also choose to view the nucleotide sequence alignments in 5'/3' UTR or coding sequence by clicking on the hyperlinks in the left panel. the white, blue, and green circles represent the target, HIV-1, and other human proteins, respectively. users are advised to take advantage of the Feature Settings box to obtain a clear view of the sequence alignment. a detailed description of JalView can be found at the JalView website http://www.jalview.org. from CAPIH, we have identified 322 and 282 human- and chimpanzee-only glycosylation events, respectively. many of these proteins are T cell surface antigens. however, at position 52 the glycosylation site (Asn) was substituted by Thr in mouse. a substitution 2 11 23 5 PTM 0 7 13 4 Indel 0 0 0 0 Note that APOBEC 3D and 3G are not listed because their human-chimpanzee orthology is ambiguous. the mutations in the cytidine deaminase domain are considered responsible for the host-retrovirus PPIs. the mouse sequence is shorter than those of the hominoids by nearly 100 amino acid residues at the C-terminus. the loss of the C-terminal amino acids in mouse VPRBP may have certain effects on the Vpr-VPRBP binding affinity. this difference should be experimentally verified and taken into account in mouse-based HIV-1 studies. species-specific indels were identified by using the INDELSCAN Web server [21,22]. in the case of indels, the quality scores of the 15 nucleotides on either side were averaged. the potential protein interaction hot sites were identified using 3D-partner [29]. the classification of interaction key phrases can be found online at http://bioinfo-dbb.nhri.org.tw/capih/keyphrases.php\"search_target=keyphrases.php\"search_target=keyphrases.php. rhesus macaque has a much larger number of species-specific PTM events than hominoids. each of the hominoids still has more than 950 species-specific PTM events. rhesus macaque has 4,600 species-specific PTM events.

APOBEC3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3F, and 3G. CAPIH indicates none of these proteins has an orthologue in the mouse genome. APOBEC 3B/3C may have played an important role in the divergence of hominoid immune responses against retroviruses. however, the changes in 3A and 3F, though not as drastic, can also have functional effects. functional studies are required to unravel the biological implications of these changes. CAPIH shows two experimentally verified N-glycosylation sites in the CD3G molecule (NP_000064) at positions 52 and 92. however, at position 52 the glycosylation site (Asn) was substituted by Thr in mouse. the one at position 92 becomes Asp and Glu in rhesus macaque and mouse respectively. the mutations in the cytidine deaminase domain are considered responsible for the host-retrovirus PPIs and the host-range specificities of retroviruses. APOBEC3B and 3C have obviously diverged more than 3A and 3F both in terms of the number of amino acid substitutions and the number of potential PTM changes. however, the changes in 3A and 3F, though not as drastic, can also have functional effects. a web-based interactive tool for comparative studies of host-HIV interactions in four different model animals. the interface may provide new insights into HIV studies. the differences in genetic backgrounds must be controlled for appropriate interpretation of mouse-based HIV studies. in both human and chimpanzee has an average of 0.4 species-specific phosphorlation sites. the large numbers of species-specific PTMs in HIV-interacting proteins illustrate the great potential of PTM studies in virology and AIDS studies. the interface is the first web-based tool to provide comparative information of genetic changes and PTMs in host-pathogen interactions. authors' contributions FCC conceived the project. all authors read and approved the manuscript."}
