{"summary": "the review found strong evidence that modern farming practices and intensified systems can be linked to disease emergence and amplification. but the evidence is not sufficient to judge whether the net effect of intensified agricultural production is more or less propitious to disease emergence and amplification than if it was not used. anthropogenic Environmental Change. Encroachment of human settlements and agriculture on natural ecosystems results in expansion of ecotones. association between disease emergence and ecotones has been suggested for several diseases, including yellow fever, Lyme disease, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Nipah virus encephalitis, influenza, rabies, cholera, leptospirosis, malaria. isolates from humans and livestock living near forest fragments were genetically more similar to those from nonhuman primates. the degree of similarity increased with the level of anthropogenic disturbance in the forest fragment. emergence of bat-associated viruses in Australia is associated with loss of bat habitat due to deforestation and agricultural expansion. burgdorferi infection prevalence than ticks in low vertebrate diversity habitats, and there is a greater abundance of ticks in low diversity habitats. the reemergence of Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, has been attributed to anthropogenic environmental change leading to low mammal diversity. effective management and biosecurity measures will mitigate the between-herd spread of zoonotic diseases, such as brucellosis and tuberculosis (40). antimicrobials are often used for growth promotion, disease prevention, or therapeutically, which in turn promote the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic pathogens (41). Intensive livestock farming can promote disease transmission through environmental pathways (38). increase in human salmonellosis due to adaptation of Salmonella enteritidis phage type 4 to poultry reproductive tract. emergence of vero cytotoxin-producing E. coli O157 to infect humans via contaminated beef and by environmental transmission. first known outbreak of Nipah virus occurred in 1998\u20131999. the initial 1997 outbreak on the index pig farm died out quickly. but the reintroduction of virus into a partially immune population in 1998 resulted in prolonged circulation on the farm. a large outbreak occurred in humans, stimulating an investigation and the discovery of Nipah virus as the causative agent (11, 29). henipaviruses are not restricted to the range of pteropid bats (52, 53) henipaviruses are segmented RNA viruses that evolve constantly by reassortment and mutation. they are found in birds, humans, pigs, horses, cats, dogs, and other animals. increased trade in poultry and poultry products can rapidly spread infection to new farms, areas, or countries. live bird markets in particular play an important role in disseminating infection and provide opportunities for cross-species transmission between domestic and wild birds. pigs develop viremia and are amplifiers for human infection (24, 25) pigs develop viremia and are amplifiers for human infection (24, 25) pigs develop viremia and are amplifiers for human infection. a study of the gut bacterium Escherichia coli in humans, livestock, and wildlife around Kibale National Park in Uganda found that isolates from humans and livestock were genetically more similar to those from nonhuman primates in the forest fragments. the degree of similarity increased with the level of anthropogenic disturbance in the forest fragment. Ticks occurring in forests with high vertebrate diversity have lower B. burgdorferi infection prevalence than ticks in low vertebrate diversity habitats. the reemergence of Chagas disease has been attributed to anthropogenic environmental change leading to low mammal diversity and abundance of the common opossum. sification of livestock production, especially pigs and poultry, facilitates disease transmission by increasing population size and density (14, 38, 39) effective management and biosecurity measures will mitigate the between-herd spread of zoonotic diseases, such as brucellosis and tuberculosis (40). Intensive livestock farming can promote disease transmission through environmental pathways (38) increase in human salmonellosis due to adaptation of Salmonella enteritidis phage type 4 to poultry reproductive tract. emergence of vero cytotoxin-producing E. coli O157 to infect humans via contaminated beef. first known outbreak of Nipah virus occurred in 1998\u20131999. the initial 1997 outbreak on the index pig farm died out quickly, causing only a few human cases. the reintroduction of virus into a partially immune population in 1998 resulted in prolonged circulation on the farm, increasing the risk of spread to other farms and humans. influenza viruses are segmented RNA viruses that evolve constantly by reassortment and mutation to create new strains of varying pathogenicity and host range (54, 55) they are found in birds, humans, pigs, horses, cats, dogs, and other animals (54, 56) the increased trade in poultry and poultry products can rapidly spread infection to new farms, areas, or countries. the human disease impact of recently emerged human pathogenic influenza viruses has been lower than was observed during the last century. the potential remains for the evolution of a variant that is highly transmissible to humans and of high pathogenicity (54) some wildlife species have adapted to and thrived in the ecological landscape created by human settlement and agriculture. some wildlife species have become reservoirs for disease in livestock and humans. zoonotic disease has emerged or reemerged. many livestock, mainly intensive, genetically homogeneous, biosecure Fewer contacts between livestock, and people; increasing contacts with wildlife. climate variability interacts with these environmental changes to contribute to disease emergence (65) changes in the ecosystem can lead to increased pathogen transmission between hosts or greater contact with new host populations or host species. a priority for research should be a holistic perspective on pathogen dynamics at the wildlife\u2013livestock\u2013human interface. a qualitative systematic review was carried out during late 2010 to early 2011 by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in epidemiology, socioeconomics, and ecology. literature database search terms and algorithms were defined. more than 280 unique algorithms were used and more than 100 keywords."}
