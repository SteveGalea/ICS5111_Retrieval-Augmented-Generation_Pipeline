{"summary": "IFN-s have been ascribed a role in anti-microbial defense in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. human IFN-s are encoded by the IFNL gene locus on chromosome 19. polymorphisms predict viral clearance in subjects infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) the frequency of the unfavorable IFNL4 genotypes is several-fold higher among Africans (35\u201340% TT at rs12979860) than among Esat-Asians and Caucasians (10\u201315% TT) these racial differences largely mirror the likelihood of resolution of HCV infection. nasopharyngeal swabs were retrieved from all patients at the initial visit. specimens were shipped to the department of Virology at university of gothenburg. Detection of pathogens and Genotyping at IFNL nucleic acid was extracted in a MagNA Pure LC instrument. genomes at rs12979860 and rs368234815 were determined on host DNA recovered from the nasopharyngeal swabs using a 5'nuclease assay. rs12979860 genotyping was performed using a predesigned assay. custom MGB probes and primers were used for genotyping of rs368234815 at concentrations of 200 and 900 nM. rs12979860 genotyping was performed in 477 patients (99.2% of the study population) among whom 161 had follow-up nasopharyngeal swabs. rs368234815 genotyping was performed in 156 out of 161 patients. a 200 L specimen of nasopharyngeal swabs was extracted using the total nucleic acid isolation kit. nucleic acids were eluted in 100 l and 5 L was used in 20 L real-time PCR reactions. oligonucleotides targeting parainfluenzavirus 1\u20133, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, coronaviruses. 368234815 were determined on host DNA recovered from the nasopharyngeal swabs using a 5'nuclease assay. rs12979860 genotyping was performed using a predesigned assay. custom MGB probes and primers were used for genotyping of rs368234815. rs368234815 was performed in 156 out of 161 patients with follow-up nasopharyngeal swabs. examples of allelic discrimination plots for IFNL4 rs12979860 and rs368234815 are shown in Figures S1 and S2 respectively. n % Gender (n = 471) Male 256 54.4 Female 215 45.6 Age (years, n = 477) 1 130 27.3 1\u20133 241 50.5 >3\u20135 106 22.2 History of atopy (n = 159) 25 15.7 Fever (n = 161) 148 91.9 Cough (n = 161) 158 98.1 Sore throat (n = 158) 10 6.3 Running nose (n = 161) 126 78.3 Dysp IFNL4 genotyping showed that 18% of patients carried the CC genotype at rs12979860 while 49 and 33% of patients carried CT and TT genotypes. the frequency of the favorable alleles was 42.6% for rs12979860-C allele and 39.7% for rs368234815-TT allele. 16 out of 18 patients cleared all DNA viruses (89%), 56/132 (42%) cleared all RNA viruses while 6/157 (4%) cleared all bacteria. 69% of patients had acquired a new pathogen, most commonly an RNA virus (52%), at the second round of sampling. 159 patients were stratified based on IFN- rs12979860 genotype. results show the proportion of patients within each genotype who cleared (A) all analyzed RNA viruses (i.e., enterovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenzavirus, RSV, morbillivirus, and metapneumovirus) rs12979860 and rs368234815 were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.998; r2 = 0.89, Table S5) rs12979860 and rs368234815 were in strong linkage disequilibrium (d' = 0.998; r2 = 0.89, Table S5) IFNL4 genotypes did not significantly predict reinfection with new viruses. two children, both carrying TT at rs12979860, died from infections. one had a rhinovirus infection and both carried S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. 91 28.8 Outcome (n = 212) Recovered 210 99.1 Deceased 2 0.9 Pathogens at baseline (n = 480) ss(+)RNA virusesa Enterovirus 102 21.2 Rhinovirus 181 37.7 Coronavirus 18 3.8 ss(\u2013)RNA virusesb Influenza A virus 33 6.9 Influenza B virus 27 5.6 HPIVc 21 4.4 RSVc 85 17.7 Morbillivirus 7 1.5 HMPVc 23 IFNL4 genetic variants n % HWE (P)a rs12979860 (n = 477) Genotypes 0.94 CC 86 18.0 CT 234 49.1 TT 157 32.9 Allele frequency C 42.6 T 57.4 rs368234815 (n = 156) Genotypes 0.38 TT/TT 22 14.1 TT/G 80 51.3 G/G 54 34.6 Allele frequency TT 39.7 G 60.3 rs12979860 genotypes were compared with 38% of patients with CT genotype and 24% of patients with TT genotype. we did not observe a significant impact of rs12979860 genotypes on the clearance of single-stranded (\u2013)RNA viruses (P > 0.5) rs12979860 CC 13 10 9 8 6 3 7 8 1 0 3 25 CT 31 34 17 28 14 10 9 26 9 1 1 76 TT 11 33 9 29 7 12 9 25 7 1 2 51 Pa 0.007 0.03 0.1 0.2 0.7 0.3 OR (95% CI)b 2.1 (1.2, 3.5) 1.9 (1.1,3.5) 2.0 (0.9, 4.4) 1.5 (0.8, 2.8) 1.6 (0.1, 22) 2.0 (0.6,6.4) rs12979860 and rs368234815 were in strong linkage disequilibrium. in accordance, there was a trend toward improved clearance of all RNA viruses among carriers of TT allele at rs368234815. IFNL4 genotypes did not significantly predict reinfection with new viruses. the most recently discovered member of the IFN- family, IFN-4, displays 30% amino acid identity with IFN- 1\u20133 but shares the antiviral activity of other IFN-s. the formation of IFN-4 is regulated by a dinucleotide frameshift variant, IFNL4-G at rs368234815. the findings imply a role for IFN-4 in the defense against RNA viruses. but the results are counter-intuitive as subjects who cannot generate IFN-4 show improved outcome of HCV infection. the formation of IFN-4 may thus compromise the anti-viral defense exerted by type I IFNs. unfavorable IFNL4 variants are several-fold more common in africans than in subjects of non-African descent. the high frequency of unfavorable IFNL4 variants may contribute to severe respiratory RNA virus infections among African children. the IFNL4 genotype did not predict clearance of DNA viruses or bacteria. the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. conflict of interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
