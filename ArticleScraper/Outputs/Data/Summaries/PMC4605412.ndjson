{"summary": "Recruits in four successive royal Thai Army basic training classes living in military barracks were monitored for the symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) or upper respiratory illness (URI) classes 1 and 2 were also monitored after basic training. influenza RT-PCR performed along with the analysis of bed locations within the barracks. diverse individuals can lead to the introduction of one or more pathogens into a confined population leading to an outbreak of infections. military personnel and children may be at greater risk of infection than other groups. a respiratory illness study among new military recruits at a royal Thai army barracks in Bangkok, Thailand. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Royal Thai Army in Bangkok, Thailand. the study included recruits from four consecutive classes from the same training camp. URI or ILI was defined as an acute onset respiratory illness with a measured temperature (oral) >38\u00b0C (1005\u00b0F) with a cough or sore throat. acute samples collected during basic training of class 1 were tested by multiplex real-time PCR using rRT-PCR. all analyses were performed using formulae from Rothman and Greenland. the Cochrane\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel test was used for linear trend of differences in row means (vcdExtra package in r) to evaluate trend over the weeks between enrollment and leave after basic training. values of (d) > 1 indicate spatial clustering of cases at that distance. all individuals were resampled with replacement and (d) recalculated over 500 iterations. laboratory Nasal and throat swabs were tested for influenza viruses. we used the mantel-Haenszel chi-square test to evaluate the P-for-trend. we included a P-for-trend from the enrollment week to the last full week before dismissal for post-basic leave. results The May 2012 recruit class arrived at the barracks between May 1 and 3, 2012 (class 1); basic training began on May 14. the recruits were allowed to go on leave on July 17 after basic training. sixty-one returned on January 30 and were posted to smaller barracks. all classes Total n = 122 (%) n = 113 (%) n = 105 (%) n = 445 (%) Age 20 56 (459) 10 (88) 47 (448) 11 (107) 124 (280) 21 39 (320) 78 (690) 29 (276) 79 (767) 225 (508) 22\u201325 24 (197) 23 (204) 27 (257) 12 (117) 86 (194) 26\u201331 3 (25) 2 (18) 2 (19) 1 (1) 8 sixty-six URIs and 11 ILIs occurred in 56 class 1 recruits between weeks 2 and 10 of basic training. infection rate was 56 per 100 recruit-weeks (95% CI: 55\u201386). illnesses per 100 recruit-weeks (95% CI: 38\u201368) the P-for-trend for the decrease in the rate of illness during basic training was 001. two subjects had URI after subjects were allowed to go on leave. post-basic training The rate of respiratory illness among class 1 recruits upon their return to camp was 40 per 100 recruit-weeks (95% CI: 31\u201351) multiplex PCR was performed on 76 of the 77 nasal/throat swab specimens collected from class 1. three pathogens were detected among 31 (408%) of 76 specimens. URI, upper respiratory illness; ILI, influenza-like illness. at least 37% of recruits had a high school or vocational school education, while 23% had only a primary school education. 60% reported being current smokers with 186 (70%) smoking half a pack per day or less. only 2% had been vaccinated for influenza in previous 12 months. six URIs and 11 ILIs occurred in 56 class 1 recruits between weeks 2 and 10 of basic training. infection rate was 56 per 100 recruit-weeks (95% CI: 55\u201386). the infection rate was 47 respiratory illnesses per 100 recruit-weeks (95% CI: 32\u201367). the P-for-trend for the decrease in the rate of illness during basic training was 001. 0 0 23 December 2012 0 0 23 December 2012 0 0 23 June 2013 0 0 22 December 2013 23 219 9 1 July 2012 0 0 6 January 2013 0 0 7 July 2013 0 0 5 January 2014 0 0 P-for-trend 1** Weeks 2\u201310 0170 Weeks 3\u201310 00001 Weeks 4\u20139 0012 Weeks 4\u201311 0006 P-for-trend 2*** Weeks 2\u201311 0016 Weeks flu RT-PCR and multiplex PCR were performed on 76 of the 77 nasal/throat swab specimens collected during basic training. only one sample (in class 3) was found to be positive for influenza virus (type B) between 39% (class 4) and 46% (class 1) of recruits reported respiratory illness with incidence rates ranging from 47 to 69 per 100 recruit-weeks. the viral pathogens identified, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and parainfluenza virus, were compatible with URI symptoms. the time the recruits came together in the camps did not correspond to significant virus transmission in Thailand. a larger study involving thousands of individuals would be more likely to capture such outbreaks. it is also possible that the conditions within military barracks in the tropics may be less favorable for transmission of these viruses compared with more temperate climates. soldiers in basic training were more likely to experience URI/ILI than soldiers who had already completed basic training in the same camps. this higher infection rate among recruits in basic training is, however, at the lower end of the 2- to 16-fold higher rates seen in U.S. soldiers. the situation of new recruits in a military barracks represents a unique combination of sudden convergence of geographically diverse individuals. the conditions for enhanced disease transmission in the RTA barracks may have been different from barracks in more temperate climates such as the united states.
