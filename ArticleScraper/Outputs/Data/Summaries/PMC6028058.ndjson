{"summary": "aedes mosquito-transmitted viral disease of humans, Zika, was originally identified in 1947. for close on 70 years, the prevalence of Zika infection was very low, such that prior to now it has attracted little interest apart from arbovirus and tropical medicine specialists. in the last few months, this scenario has changed dramatically, however, following a major Zika epidemic in over 35 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. the main symptoms may last for up to 1 week and are similar to but less severe than other related febrile illnesses. a mild headache, fever, myalgia, arthralgia, conjunctivitis, and maculopapular rash. the principal possible consequence of Zika infection, for which there is now claimed to be a causal link, can be severe. the geographical distribution of A. aegypti is expanding gradually in tropical and subtropical zones. a more rapid spread of the virus via the intercontinental travel of infected persons is an additional concern. a more rapid spread of the virus via the intercontinental travel of infected persons is an additional concern. aegypti is responsible for transmitting yellow fever, japanese encephalitis, dengue, and chikungunya, viruses that have far more impact on global public health. aegypti is also responsible for transmitting yellow fever, japanese encephalitis, dengue, and chikungunya, viruses that have far more impact on global public health. there is a knowledge gap surrounding infection transmission and clinical manifestations of disease. no prophylactic vaccine or therapeutic drug is currently available with which to treat Zika infection. vaccine development pathway from candidate design through preclinical screening to final approval for public administration is long, demanding, and expensive. TV003 has proved 100% effective, albeit a small scale volunteer challenge study of only the dengue-2 serotype performed under highly controlled conditions. a modified version of the live attenuated construct may be developed in order to treat the related Zika virus. this head start may accelerate production of a candidate Zika vaccine but will not truncate its potentially arduous journey through clinical trials."}
