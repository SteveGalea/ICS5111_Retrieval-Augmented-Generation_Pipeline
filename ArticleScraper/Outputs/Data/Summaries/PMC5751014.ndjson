{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) has received notification of 2090 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV from 27 countries. between 2012 and 2017, Qatar reported 19 MERS-CoV cases, including seven deaths. authorities tend to be hesitant to declare an outbreak a public health emergency when there is insufficient information about its evolution. the development of this case study is grounded on the crisis and emergency risk communication framework. the framework describes how health communication functions within the context of risks and crisis. this case report is an attempt to apply the CERC framework in the conduction of evaluation activities aimed at monitoring key actions undertaken by the Supreme Council of Health in Qatar. the proposed case study provides information on how the SCH followed some of the actions recommended in the CERC framework during the pre-crisis and initial phase of the 2013 MERS outbreak. methods We have chronologically tracked Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemiologic events and the Emergency Risk Communication strategies implemented by the Supreme Council of Health (SCH) over the course of three phases of the epidemic. each phase roughly resembled the curve of an epidemic lifecycle (pre epidemic, epidemic, and post epidemic an electronic search was run for the word \u201ccorona\u201d in the online archive of al-Raya Newspaper to retrieve all of the relevant news stories. the stories were then compiled and matched with the SCH\u2019s press releases, records of activities performed by the national response authorities, and public reactions. the SCH and the animal health department agreed to establish a joint leadership response to the MERS-CoV outbreak. the first case is declared in Britain A novel and virus with great deal of uncertainty. no need to \u201cPanic\u201d as no further cases were detected. the SCH managed to timely announce the case and explain the undertaken measures. SCH maintains close communication with the UK hospital where the patient was transferred to be abreast of the clinical developments of the patient Reports on patient status and transfer to the UK: Family members were interviewed. despite initiating reasonable public health measures, the SCH still seemed not to cope with the urgency of the situation. SCH spoke-person is interviewed on hajj preparations. the media reported on the press conference which addressed the clinical and preventive measures including the risk of MERS. on this date, the first laboratory case of MERS-CoV in Qatar (Q1) was confirmed. a press conference was held the following day, 24 September 2012, by the SCH\u2019s designated spokesperson. the SCH admitted the lack of knowledge on how to best clinically manage the case. the patient\u2019s relative expressed dissatisfaction with the medical care provided. the SCH was in contact with the UK hospital to which the patient was admitted. no new cases were identified and preventive measures had been initiated. a SCH spokesperson was interviewed about the preparations for the Hajj on 3 October 2012. he reassured the public by focusing on the following two facts: (1) seasonal flu immunization is mandatory, as per KSA health regulations for pilgrims; and that (2) the situation was being monitored through information sharing with the KSA and WHO. decision makers approved the proposed roadmap despite uncertainty about the nature of the epidemic and the indefinite outcomes of the ratified proposed actions. daily and weekly surveillance reports were communicated among the NOCT and the leaders of the represented institutions as part of stakeholders\u2019 information sharing. this allowed for a national consensus on the anticipated risk of MERS-CoV and the establishment of a recommended course of action. medical and public health preparations, including coordination with the KSA health authorities, were regularly communicated with the public. the training informed HCWs on the evolving epidemiological situation, the updated WHO risk assessment, the appropriate infection prevention and control measures. no cases of the novel coronavirus were reported among the 3.2 million pilgrims, the citizens of the KSA or the citizens of Qatar until after the end of October 2012. despite the concern, no cases of the novel coronavirus were reported among the 3.2 million pilgrims, the citizens of the KSA, or the citizens of Qatar until after the end of October 2012. the media reported the second Qatari case and reflected the public fears and demands to bring about an enhanced response. the media invested in the novelty of the threat to raise the public concern and thus poking the SCH to step up its response efforts. s suspected contacts were screened and tested negative as confirmed by a qualified external laboratory. (4) WHO had been officially notified of the case (Q2), which was identified as the sixth case worldwide. (5) intensive consultations were held via conference call on the day following the confirmation of the case (21 November) the SCH disseminated a press release disclosing the minutes from a meeting that detailed the response efforts that were undertaken upon the confirmation of the second case. the press release proclaimed that most of the measures that the public demanded were already in place. the media accounts provided basic information about the disease but mostly focused on the personal story of the second Qatari patient. the SCH refuted the latter emphasizing the alertness of the surveillance system. it is unclear whether the awareness campaign has just coincided with the new case or it was launched as an upbringing of the national response. despite the previous season passed uneventful in terms of virus spread, concerns remained high that it can still affect Pilgrims. despite the previous season passed uneventful in terms of virus spread, concerns remained high that it can still affect Pilgrims. a simple comparison with KSA was reassuring to the local community in Qatar. the senate recommendation acknowledged the ongoing investigation and control efforts but demanded these to be reinforced in terms of disease monitoring domestically and abroad. SCH and MOE jointly held a press conference to address the concerns of the public and camel owners. it was not easy to convince the camel owners to accept the notion that their camels might play a role in the disease transmission. a spokesperson reassured the situation is stable while yet more is to be known about the virus risk and behavior. on 20 august 2013, the SCH published a press release stating that a third MERS-CoV case (Q3) had been confirmed. this third patient was a Qatari national who was diagnosed abroad and his clinical was reported as not severe and stable. the SCH launched an awareness campaign on MERS-CoV. on 18 October 2013, the SCH proclaimed that they had detected a new MERS-CoV case (Q5) another Qatari citizen. the total number of reported cases reached 120, among which 51 perished. on 27 October 2013, the SCH revealed that a new MERS-CoV case had been detected (Q6). the death of two MERS-CoV cases was reported on 19 and 21 November 2013 respectively. the number of those killed by the virus in KSA reached 55 out of 130 reported cases. on 25 November 2013, the SCH announced that the virus was isolated from two camels in a barn. SCH and the animal health department agreed to establish a joint leadership response to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak. the plan states that all of the messages need to be jointly approved by the SCH and AHD. the first laboratory confirmed case is declared in Britain A novel and virus with great deal of uncertainty. the SCH managed to announce the case and explain the undertaken measures. this constitutes the \u2018initial phase\u2019 as described by the CERC. however, empathy was hardly expressed to the patient and his family. it was a little early to generate behavioral messages that conveyed a paternalistic approach. the patient is improving and the SCH was engaged with the UK authorities to closely monitor the patient. this is in response to the rumor that the Qatari authorities are not providing the care to the case. a medical specialist should have been sent to UK to accompany the patient. the media reported on the press conference which addressed the clinical and preventive measures including the risk of MERS. reports on first MERS case being cured indicated the level of coordination among stakeholders. public health officials at the SCH engaged in intensive consultations with WHO and the health protection agency in the united kingdom (UK). the primary purpose of these consultations was to share information including: providing updates on the clinical status of the patient, assessing the potential risk for the spread of the disease. media reports described the outbreak by focusing on three different topics. a press release was issued by the SCH three days after the detection of a rumor saying that the SCH did not undertake appropriate efforts to support the transfer of the patient to the UK. a spokesperson was interviewed regarding the preparations for the Hajj on 3 October 2012. the national outbreak control taskforce (NOCT) was formed by the SCH to respond to the outbreak. the main information sources used by the decision-makers were WHO, KSA, and HPA in the UK, and the media. the roadmap was developed by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) providing technical support in response to Qatar\u2019s request. prospective pilgrims were advised to check their health and vaccination status. the elderly, those with co-morbidities, and people with a compromised immune system were denied registration. health workers received training on what was known about the novel virus. the triage policy was adopted to ensure greater openness, trust, and collaboration. despite the concern, no cases of the novel coronavirus were reported among the 3.2 million pilgrims, the citizens of the KSA or the citizens of Qatar until after the end of October 2012. the possibility to have fresh cases was always there, providing a chance to test the recently activated public health preparedness and response. the SCH press release served the purposes of informing the public with the key details besides the executed measures in response to it. the media reported the second Qatari case and reflected the public fears and demands to bring about an enhanced response. the media reacted by circulating a WHO report on the disease remarking that MERS-CoV belongs to the SARS family. it was reported that the last patient was taken to the hospital directly from his camel barn. a decision was made by the NO. visit was challenging for both the field investigation team and the camel owners. media portrayed the public in fear and demanding a scaling up of the healthcare response in terms of raising public awareness about the virus. the SCH and other Key Stakeholders as well as Key News Reports Is Provided Below and Summarized in Table 3 Table 3. Third phase of the epidemic (20 August 2013\u201317 March 2014) Third case confirmed Hajj season pilgrimage begins Communication with major stakeholders is maintained including neighboring countries. the SCH decided to declare this death coupled with the cure of another recently confirmed case. 7 September 2013 Fourth case dies and third case is cured Press release announcing the death of the fourth case and recovery of the third case. more facts were being shared to help establish a realistic understanding of the virus. a simple comparison with KSA was reassuring to the local community in Qatar. senate demands were somehow portrayed as a response to the media outcry to step up the national response to the virus threat. despite the situation in the country was not as bad as it was in other neighboring countries, having the subject discussed in the senate could indicate to serious public concerns. the SCH decided to hold a press conference as a form of communicating updates related to MERS. a spokesperson reassured that \"the situation is stable\" while yet more is to be known about the virus risk and behavior. the SCH had established a helpline for the public and created a dedicated webpage. the SCH launched an awareness campaign on MERS-CoV. this campaign coincided with the Hajj season during the second year of the epidemic. the newly confirmed case had been in contact with a previously confirmed MERS-CoV case. the previously declared case (Q5) had been cured and discharged from the hospital. no new case was reported in Qatar until 8 November 2013. school principals in Qatar voiced their concerns about insufficient number of school nurses to meet course of action recommended by the health authorities. the SCH and MOE said that there was no intention to restrict camel movement due to the fact that there was insufficient evidence of the role camels played in the disease transmission pattern. on 6 December 2013, the MOE stated that Qatar is \u201csafe\u201d from the virus, as ongoing screening was being jointly performed. the SCH acknowledged the situation, but also reported actions undertaken. however, the response was not without error. the inherent uncertainty and lack of sufficient information caused the media to provide conflicting messages. the data rely on one source of mainstream print media. future research should focus on analyzing information shared on social media. the data rely on one source of mainstream print media. this case study consolidated the validity of the framework and emphasized the significant role of communication primarily as a public health tool for managing emergencies. however, further work is needed to develop more rigorous and comprehensive research strategies to assess the impact of ERC during such crises."}
