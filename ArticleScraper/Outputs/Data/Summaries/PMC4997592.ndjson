{"summary": "the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause severe respiratory disease and death in roughly 36% of infected humans [2] there is considerable field and experimental evidence that dromedary camels serve as an important reservoir host involved in transmission to humans. there has been speculation that this disease originated through a cross-species transmission from bats to camels or humans [9,10,11] goats (n = 5) were evaluated for viral shedding, organ burden, and seroconversion and transmission to co-housed goats (n = 2). limited viral shedding was observed without demonstration of viral transmission. animals did not become productively infected or seroconvert. horses and sheep were monitored for viral shedding and seroconversion. horses and sheep were euthanized on day 28 post-inoculation. horse 4 was euthanized on day 17 due to an injury. animals were bred on site and gave birth to either two (Doe 1) or three kids (Doe 2). all animals were inoculated intranasally with 1.4 106 to 1.9 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) of a low passage human isolate of MERS-CoV. trachea, larynx, and lung samples were collected from two kids (goat 1c and 2a) on day 5 post-infection and frozen for virus titration or fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. a rabbit polyclonal antiserum was collected immediately prior to inoculation and weekly thereafter until necropsy. two goats were euthanized on day 5-post infection and nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung were collected. very small but confirmed quantities of virus were isolated from the turbinates of both goats euthanized 5 days post-infection (DPI) the remaining goats were euthanized on day 28 post-infection and their cohoused dams were assessed. mother goats are indicated as 1 or 2 and their corresponded kids are indicated as 1a, 1b, 1c (Doe 1), 2a, or 2b (Doe 2). Titers represent dilutions of serum which neutralized 90% of input virus. ND = not done. despite no detectable rise in rectal temperature or change in appetite and activity, horses 1 and 3 showed mild intermittent nasal discharge prior to inoculation. Virus was not detected in any of the nasal swab specimens tested from horse 1. goats were assessed for clinical disease, viral shedding, seroconversion, and viral transmission to their mothers. low levels of infectious virus were detected in either of the adult goats that had intimate contact or the kids from doe 2. small amounts of cellular debris, leukocytes and mucus were present in the nasal cavity, mainly associated with the affected areas. these tissues were negative for viral antigen by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the histopathologic lesions were very likely the result of trauma from daily swabbing rather than due to virus replication. sheep 3 sheep were experimentally infected and evaluated for clinical disease, viral shedding, and seroconversion. a small quantity of virus was detected in nasal swabs from sheep 1 on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 and from sheep 2 on day 6. the sheep were euthanized on day 28 post-infection. Virus was detected on day 3 in horse 2, day 2 in horse 3 and day 1 in horse 4. he was not detected in any of the nasal swab specimens tested from horse 1. the limit of detection for this assay is 1.5 log10 PFU/mL. s re-challenged 80 days after an initial infection was not able to detect infectious virus upon re-challenge. another study with alpacas re-challenged on day 28 post-infection was unable to detect viral RNA upon re-challenge. the main objective of this study was to determine the role these animals might play in transmission of the virus. infected and are not important in viral transmission of MERS-CoV."}
