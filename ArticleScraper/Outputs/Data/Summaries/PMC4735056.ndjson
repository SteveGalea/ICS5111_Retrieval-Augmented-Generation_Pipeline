{"summary": "the mortality rate of A(H7N9) infection is 37.1% (212/571).2 Liver derangement commonly occurs in A(H7N9)-infected patients. the causes of severe acute liver impairment include hepatotropic virus infection, drug-induced liver injury (DILI), ischaemic liver injury and liver trauma. 112 patients with avian flu H7N9 infection admitted to the ICU of the first Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine from March 2013 to February 2015 were screened. HH criteria patients who met all of the following criteria were diagnosed as having HH according to the criteria. post-mortem biopsy was performed in one confirmed fatal case of HH with A(H7N9) infection (case 1). Written consent was obtained from the relatives of the patient prior to the biopsy. two biopsy cores from the liver and one biopsy from each organ were taken according to institutional protocols. patients and clinical investigation A total of 112 patients with avian flu H7N9 infection admitted to the ICU from March 2013 to February 2015 were screened. liver function was tested daily for the first week and at least twice during the remainder of the hospital stay. the second liver biopsy core was directly homogenized and subjected to real-time RT-PCR for avian influenza A(H7N9)-specific genes. primers and probes used for avian influenza A(H7N9) RT-PCR testing in this study. the proportion of patients with liver impairment was lower on admission than during the hospital stay. antiviral therapy was performed in all 112 patients, while antibiotic therapy was performed in 91 (81.3%) and glucocorticoid therapy in 63 (56.2%). the proportion of patients with liver impairment was lower on admission than during the hospital stay. HH patients vs. liver injury without HH peak ALT level during hospital stay. an ALT level of >20-fold the ULN was found in only two patients. the incidence of HH in our single-centre cohort of ICU patients with A(H7N9) infection was 1.8% (2/112). the patient exhibited ventricular tachycardia and was in atrial fibrillation (130 bpm) his mean arterial pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg by norepinephrine administration at a dose of 0.67 g/kgmin. the patient had a history of contact with live poultry seven days before admission. peak ALT, AST and LDH activities occurred on the second day of admission. the INR peaked at 1.52 on the sixth day. serologic test results were negative for viral hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, Epstein\u2013Barr virus. ine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; INR, international normalized ratio; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; TB, total bilirubin. the patient died on day 6 of hospitalization. the patient had a two-week history of cough with sputum and sudden deterioration with a fever of 38.1 \u00b0C prior to admission. the patient had a recent history of contact with live poultry 10 days prior to admission. a second echocardiogram showed recovery of LVEF to 62% without accompanying weakened cardiac wall motion. ALT, AST and LDH activities were elevated to 1281, 3029, and 2787 U/L respectively, the highest levels seen during the patient's hospital stay. total bilirubin level was 20 mol/L; INR was prolonged to 1.61. the patient had a history of contact with live poultry seven days before admission. his mean arterial pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg by norepinephrine administration. 117 and 3001 U/L occurred on the second day of admission. the INR peaked at 1.52 on the sixth day. hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus were negative. the patient was identified as having a severe A(H7N9) infection with MOF and HH, placed on a mechanical ventilator and given fluid resuscitation. the patient died on day 6 of hospitalization. the patient had a 30-year history of bronchiectasia that had been progressing to pulmonary heart disease for 10 years. on admission, an echocardiogram showed a dilated left ventricle with a low LVEF of 37.5%. the patient was identified as having a severe A(H7N9) infection with MOF. the patient died on day 4 of hospitalization due to deterioration of MOF. severe liver impairment (ALT > 20-fold the ULN) was rare (n = 2, 1.8%). HH could be differentiated from other types of liver injury by means of a sharp elevation in the ALT level. HH is a common cause of acute liver injury in the ICU setting. severe A(H7N9) infection will lead to respiratory failure, and respiratory failure will in turn induce a sudden decrease in oxygen supply to the liver. the presence of a chronic disease that reduces baseline oxygen supply to the liver is an indicator of HH risk in A(H7N9) patients. the prevalence of HH in ICU patients with A(H7N9) infection in our centre is 1.8%. most studies have reported a prevalence of 1%\u20132%. the in-hospital mortality rate of HH is 45%. 8% prevalence of HH in patients with A(H7N9) infection. the typical pathological change of HH, centrilobular necrosis of the liver, was confirmed."}
