{"summary": "influenza is the most well studied viral infection, and is commonly reported (around 50%) as the cause of epidemics of respiratory infection, including nosocomial outbreaks. influenza is the most well studied viral infection, and is commonly reported (around 50%) as the cause of epidemics of respiratory infection. the rate of fever was 66% (137/207) in hospitalized influenza cases. in patients admitted with myocardial infarction, 9% had unrecognized and undiagnosed influenza on testing at admission, highlighting the low level of clinical suspicion of influenza. symptomatic cases were asked to complete diary cards on a daily basis. thermometers were given participants to measure their temperature daily and at symptom onset. symptomatic cases were asked to complete sick follow-up forms. data was analysed using SAS v. 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., USA) Ethical approval Ethical approval of two clinical trials (China trials 2008\u20132009 and 2009\u20132010) were obtained from the Institutional Review Board and Human Research Ethics Committee of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control. ninety (57%) cases were from China and 68 (43%) were from Vietnam. most participants were nurses (65%) and female (87%) most cases were non-smokers (92%) and had not received influenza vaccine (86%) 177 Influenza A and B viruses 13 82 Other* 27 171 Fever Yes 37 234 No 121 766 * Other includes: parainfluenza virus (n = 12), human metapneumovirus (n = 7), coronavirus (n = 7) and adenovirus (n = 1).
