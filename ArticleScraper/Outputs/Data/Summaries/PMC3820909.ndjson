{"summary": "viral strains encoding viral RdRps with altered fidelity have been shown to lead to virus incapable of causing disease but capable of acting as vaccine strains to protect mice from a lethal challenge from wild-type virus. a better understanding of the fidelity determinants of RdRps would thus provide a framework for rational vaccine design. the T362I substitution in motif D may impact the structural dynamics of motif D and surrounding regions to affect RdRp catalysis and fidelity. a ribbon structure of PV RdRp bound with UTP (Protein Data Bank 2IM2; Ref. 24) with palm motifs colored (A, red; B, green; C, yellow; D, blue; E, purple; F, brown) highlighting the location of Thr-362, near the general acid Lys-359. amino acid substitutions at Lys-359 (e.g. K359R) lead up to a 50-fold decrease in the maximum turnover rate constant (kpol), a 5-fold increase in RdRp fidelity (as determined by kpol,correct/kpol,incorrect) and lead to the severe attenuation of the virus (29, 30, 33). all RNA oligonucleotides were from GE Healthcare; 3\u2032-deoxyadenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (cordycepin) was from Trilink Biotechnologies. all RNA oligonucleotides were from Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Boulder, CO) all other reagents were of the highest grade available from Sigma or Fisher. buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2 and 60 m ZnCl2. RNA oligonucleotides were reannealed, and concentrated RdRps were diluted to the required concentration by reaction buffer. the RNA template was 32P end-labeled. the reaction was quenched by adding an equal volume of quench buffer. products were quantitated by phosphorimaging as previously described. the protein was immersed in a truncated octahedral box filled with TIP3P (44) water molecules. the protein was immersed in a truncated octahedral box filled with a distance of at least 20 between any protein atom and the edge of the solvent box. all subsequent steps of the MD simulation were carried out using SANDER/PMEMD. mice were bred and housed in standard ventilated caging for all experiments. protocols for animal studies were approved by the IACUC. all experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines and regulations. wild-type (WT) and T362I RdRp used in kinetic and NMR studies also contain two interface I amino acid substitutions. overexpression and purification of PV RdRp were performed as described previously (31, 39\u201341) both kinetic and NMR experiments involved protein samples labeled by [methyl-13C]Met. sym/subU and pyrrolo-cytosine were substituted with 2-aminopurine and pyrrolo-cytosine. excitation and emission wavelengths were 350 and 450 nm, respectively. NMR spectra were collected at 293 K on a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm \u201cinverse detection\u201d triple-resonance (13C,1H,15N) single axis gradient TCI for the following samples. free RdRp, RdRp-RNA complex, RdRp-RNA complex, and excess 3\u2032-dATP, and RdRp-RNA-3\u2032-blocked complex after passage over the heated stepwise from 0 to 300 K with an increment of 50 K over a period of 10 ps under constant volume and temperature conditions (NVT) followed by 200 ps of NVT simulation. the neighbor pair list was updated every 10 steps. nucleoside 5\u2032-triphosphates and 2\u2032-deoxynucleoside 5\u2032-triphosphates were from GE Healthcare; 3\u2032-deoxyadenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (cordycepin) were from GE Healthcare; 3\u2032-deoxyadenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (cordycepin) were from Trilink Biotechnologies. the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. RNA templates 10-mer sym/subU and 11-mer sym/subUA were substituted with 2-aminopurine and pyrrolo-cytosine at the 5\u2032 side of the template RNA respectively. RNA oligonucleotides were reannealed and concentrated RdRps were diluted to the required concentration by reaction buffer. pyrrolo-cytosine-modified sym/sub-UA RNA excitation and emission wavelengths were 350 and 450 nm, respectively. for benchtop assays, the RdRp-RNA binary complexes were formed through incubating RdRp (0.5 m) with RNA (0.25 m duplex) for 3 min at room temperature followed by 2 min at 30 \u00b0C. the initial structural model of T362I RdRp was constructed based on the WT PV RdRp (Protein Data Bank code 1RA6) the protein was immersed in a truncated octahedral box filled with TIP3P (44) water molecules, with a distance of at least 20 between any protein atom and the edge of the solvent box. 50 plaque forming units of WT, G64S, or T362I PV were used to infect HeLa cell monolayers pretreated with the various concentrations of ribavirin. cells were incubated for 3\u20134 days at 37 \u00b0C before being stained with crystal violet (48). mice were bred and housed in standard ventilated caging for all experiments. cleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs, Inc; [methyl-13C]methionine was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. all other reagents were of the highest grade available from Sigma or Fisher. mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 60 m ZnCl2 were formed by incubating RdRp (0.5 m) with sym/sub RNA for 3 min at room temperature followed by 2 min at 30 \u00b0C. the volume of enzyme added into any reactions was never above 1 10 of the total volume. samples were analyzed by denaturing PAGE, and products were quantitated by phosphorimaging as previously described (40). samples were analyzed by denaturing PAGE, and were quantitated by phosphorimaging. MD simulation was carried out using SANDER/PMEMD in AMBER10 package (43) using the AMBER99SB force field. initial minimization of the modeled structure was done in multiple steps using SANDER. 4\u20136-Week-old outbred mice transgenic for the PV receptor (cPVR) were infected with PV at the indicated genome copy by intraperitoneal injection in 3 ml of serum-free media. mice were observed for 10 days for signs of disease and were euthanized upon showing dual limb paralysis. we compared the formation and stability of pre-chemistry RdRp-RNA reactant complexes by enzyme assembly and dissociation assays respectively (40) for our kinetic assays, we used two RNA templates (Fig. 2A), which contain a six (or seven)-base pair duplex flanked by two-, four-, (or three)-nucleotide 5\u2032 overhangs. the rate and yield of competent RdRp-RNA complexes RdRp and RNA were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 90 s at which time trap (100 m unlabeled RNA) was added to the reaction buffer. after indicated times, the reaction buffer was mixed with ATP or UTP (500 m) and then quenched after 30 s by adding EDTA (25 mm) the substitution did not substantially change kpol or Kd,app values for correct NTP incorporation using ATP for sym/subU RNA (Fig. 3B, Table 1) and UTP for sym/subUA (Table 1). however, the T362I substitution led to more efficient misincorporation of incorrect NTP either with 2\u2032-dNTP (Fig. 3C) or incorrect nucleobase (Fig. 3D) TP (D) into sym/subU RNA was more efficient for T362I RdRp () compared with WT RdRp (). kinetic parameters are located in Table 1. TABLE 1. Comparison of the kinetic constants of nucleotide incorporation for WT and T362I RdRp shows that the T362I substitution decreases polymerase fidelity. the effect of Mn2+ and D2O on nucleotide incorporation kinetics can help distinguish changes to the pre-chemistry conformational change and/or the chemistry step. in the presence of Mn2+, the pre-chemistry conformational change becomes more efficient, and kpol is then fully rate-determined by the chemistry step (51). the substitution in motif D lowers sugar and nucleobase selection by making the pre-chemistry conformational change more efficient. kinetics of correct ATP incorporation into sym/subU RNA in the presence of Mn2+ is very similar between WT () and T362I () RdRp. the introduction of Mn2+ and the T362I substitution may both enhance the rate of the pre-chemistry conformational change but not sufficiently to make the chemistry step rate-determining for GTP misincorporation. chemistry is more rate-determining for the T362I variant compared with WT RdRp. the resonances for WT RdRp bound with RNA and 2\u2032-deoxy sugar or incorrect nucleobase essentially overlap (Fig. 5C) the resonances for WT RdRp bound with RNA and 2\u2032-deoxy sugar or incorrect nucleobase essentially overlap (Fig. 5C) spectra were collected at 293 K with 245 m RdRp, 500 m RNA, and 4 mm UTP, 10 mm 2\u2032-dUTP or 8 mm ATP. the most substantial change with the T362I RdRp spectra occurs in the presence of 2\u2032-dNTP (red spectrum in Fig. 5D) the T362I variant overlaps the spectrum bound to RNA and correct UTP. this results suggest that the T362I substitution increases 2\u2032-dNTP misincorporation rates through a more efficient pre-chemistry conformational change. the effect is unlikely to be observable in the NMR spectrum. MD simulations revealed that substitution of solvent-exposed residue Thr-362 by a hydrophobic Ile in the T362I variant resulted in conformational changes nearby and distant from the mutation site. in the simulated T362I structure, the side chain of Ile-362 is stabilized by van der Waals interactions with the side chain of the nearby Phe-363. ational changes in the vicinity of Ile-362, MD simulations showed propagation of conformational changes from the mutation site to other, more distant residues at the active-site. these conformational differences include residues Ser-288 of the loop 283\u2013293, Asp-238 of motif A (both known to play a role in recognition of the sugar moiety of the nucleotide substrate) and the region encompassing the metal binding aspartates Asp-328 and Asp-329 of motif the T362I substitution resulted in conformational changes of key active-site residues known to be important for the RdRp function. the per-residue root mean square deviation (per-RMSD) calculated from the last 10 ns of the WT (gray line) and T362I (black line) trajectories are plotted. by plaque assay, there was an increase in sensitivity of T362I PV to ribavirin when compared with WT PV in cells. a more than 2-fold decrease in the concentration of ribavirin needed to reduce the number of plaques by half compared with the untreated population. mice developed symptoms of two-limb paralysis or paralysis that compromised the ability to get food and water were euthanized. increased ribavirin sensitivity suggests this mutant may be more attenuated in animals than WT PV. our recent NMR studies have implicated structural rearrangements in motif D. the T362I substitution may thus interfere with the structural rearrangements in motif D necessary for RdRp function. we compared formation and stability of pre-chemistry RdRp-RNA reactant complexes. reactions were initiated by adding RdRp (1 m) into sym/subU or sym/subUA (0.5 m duplex) and its corresponding ATP or UTP (500 m), which were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 5 min. reactions were quenched by adding 25 mm EDTA. each data point is from the averages of at least two separate experiments on different days. we also performed kinetics experiments to compare the maximum rate constant for nucleotide incorporation, kpol, and the apparent dissociation constant for NTP, Kd,app, for WT and T362I RdRp. the solid line represents the data fit to a hyperbola function to give an apparent dissociation constant (Kd,app) and a maximum rate constant for nucleotide incorporation (kpol) kinetics of correct ATP incorporation into sym/subU RNA were very similar in presence of Mg2+. dUTP 8.8 0.3 925 85 9.5 103 15 96 T362I 2'-dUTP 12 0.4 748 77 1.6 102 11 69 Incorrect nucleobase Sym/sub-U RNA WT GTP 0.011 0.000 142 15 7.7 105 5400 21,000 T362I GTP 0.018 0.001 149 25 1.2 104 3700 17,000 WT RTPa 0.019 0.002 292 the RdRp fidelity for sugar selection in Mn2+ is identical for WT (kpol,correct/kpol,incorrect = 2.2 0.1) and T362I RdRp (kpol,correct/kpol,incorrect = 2.2 0.1) this result implies that the T362I alteration primarily impacts the step made more efficient by the presence of Mn2+. the T362I variant (kpol = 1.1 0.0 s1) was still more efficient than WT RdRp (kpol = 0.78 0.00 s1). chemistry is more rate-determining for the T362I variant compared with WT RdRp. we identified a large chemical shift change to the Met-354 resonance and smaller chemical shift changes to the Met-6, Met-74, and Met-225 resonances upon formation of the correct RdRp-RNA-NTP complex for the WT enzyme. these chemical shift patterns correspond to a \u201cclosed\u201d conformation. these chemical shift patterns do not occur in the presence of the incorrect NTP, either with incorrect 2\u2032-deoxy sugar or incorrect nucleobase essentially overlap. T362I RdRp bound with RNA and 2\u2032-dUTP displays two sets of resonances (D and F), where one set overlays with that from T362I RdRp bound with RNA and UTP (D) and the other with that from T362I RdRp bound with RNA and ATP (F) these results indicate that T362I RdRp bound with RNA and 2\u2032-dUTP accesses both the open and closed conformations one set of resonances for the T362I variant bound to RNA and 2\u2032-dUTP overlaps that of the T362I variant bound to RNA and ATP. the other set of resonances for the T362I variant bound to RNA and 2\u2032-dUTP overlaps the spectrum of the T362I variant bound to RNA and correct UTP (black spectrum in Fig. 5D) findings suggest that T362I RdRp exchanges between the closed and open the in silico model for the T362I variant was compared with that of the WT enzyme. previous MD simulations have given insight into the function and fidelity of RdRp enzymes and have been consistent with NMR studies. negatively charged Glu-364 in the T362I variant is partly stabilized by the nearby side chain of Lys-359. side chains of residues Thr-365, Glu-337, Asp-339, and Ser-341, all belonging to motif D, are affected by the conformational change of Glu-364 side chain. the substitution at position 362 disrupted the local interactions. residues in the loop 283\u2013293 and selected residues in the surrounding environment are shown as sticks. the substitution resulted in conformational changes of key active-site residues. ribavirin is a nucleoside analog that is a mutagen to PV and other RNA viruses. a high fidelity PV variant, G64S, exhibits reduced sensitivity to the antiviral nucleoside, ribavirin (48). ribavirin is a mutagen to PV and other RNA viruses. cPVR mice (4\u20136 weeks old) were infected via intraperitoneal route with serum-free media containing WT or T362I PV. the increased ribavirin sensitivity of T362I PV suggests this mutant may be more attenuated in animals than WT PV. motif D has been shown to behave as a general acid to protonate the pyrophosphate leaving group in the nucleotide incorporation reaction. pre-steady-state enzyme kinetics indicated that both a pre-chemistry conformational change and the chemistry step itself are partially rate-determining (in presence of Mg2+) and thus are both important fidelity checkpoints (50) -RNA complexes were essentially identical for WT and T362I RdRp using either RNA template. these results indicate that the T362I substitution does not substantially affect RNA affinity or formation of catalytically competent RdRp-RNA-NTP complexes. kdiss(obs) for sym/subU (sym/subUA) was 4.00 0.09 104 s1 (1.70 0.07 105 s1) for WT RdRp and 3.90 0.02 104 s1 (2.70 0.03 105 s1) for T362I RdRp. RdRp (0.5 m) was incubated with sym/subU RNA (0.5 m) at room temperature for 2 min. reactions were monitored by fluorescence changes with time. kinetics of correct ATP incorporation into sym/subU RNA were very similar in the presence of Mg2+. 2 2.0 Sym/sub-UA RNA WT UTP 130 7 142 36 0.91 T362I UTP 131 2 114 9 1.1 Incorrect sugar Sym/sub-U RNA WT 2'-dATP 0.89 0.01 134 4 6.7 103 66 240 T362I 2'-dATP 1.5 0.0 112 4 1.3 102 45 150 Sym/sub-UA RNA WT 2'-dATP 8.8 0.3 925 85 9.5 kpol is then fully rate-determined by the chemistry step (51). kpol,H2O/kpol,D2O also report on the relative contribution of the chemistry step to kpol. in the presence of Mn2+, the T362I substitution did not substantially alter correct NTP incorporation or misincorporation of the 2\u2032-dNTP. U RNA in the presence of Mn2+ is consistent with the T362I substitution. the substitution may also impact the chemistry step itself for misincorporation of NTP with incorrect nucleobase in Mn2+ compared with WT RdRp. chemistry is more rate-determining for the T362I variant compared with WT RdRp. solution-state NMR Indicates that T362I Induces Structural Rearrangements within Motif D to Lower RdRp Fidelity. previous NMR experiments have been able to identify key chemical shift changes associated with Met residues in PV RdRp. the chemical shift patterns for the RdRp-RNA complexes bound with 2\u2032-dUTP and ATP are strikingly similar (C), representing an open conformation. the most substantial change with the T362I RdRp spectra occurs in the presence of 2\u2032-dNTP (red spectrum in Fig. 5D) this behavior is not observed in the presence of NTP with incorrect nucleobase (blue spectrum in Fig. 5E) the concentrations of NTP (2\u2032-dUTP = 10 mm, CTP = 8 mm) are identical for WT and T362I RdRp. this is borne out by the small chemical shift changes observed compared with the enzymes bound with RNA alone (30) this statement is consistent with the Mn2+ effects and the diminished SDKIE (Table 1). the pre-chemistry conformational change from open to closed largely governs kpol for incorrect nucleobase incorporation. 64 adopts a completely different conformation in the T362I structure relative to WT RdRp. the side chain of Glu-364 is engaged in electrostatic interactions with the Lys-228 preceding motif A. in the T362I variant the side chain of Glu-364 is swung away from the WT position to a new position where it can form H-bonding interactions with Asn-370. the two structures were superimposed using C atoms. the proteins are depicted as ribbons, and the mutated residues Thr-362/Ile-362 are shown as sticks and labeled. the substitution at position 362 disrupted the local interactions. region encompassing Asp-53 (amino acid residues 46\u201358) showed reduced nanosecond dynamics in the T362I variant compared with WT RdRp. a PV genome encoding the T362I RdRp showed no evidence of reversion to the wild-type codon even after four consecutive passages. 50 plaque forming units of WT, G64S, or T362I PV were used to infect HeLa cell monolayers pretreated with various concentrations of ribavirin. cPVR mice (4\u20136 weeks old) were infected via intraperitoneal route with serum-free media containing WT or T362I PV at the indicated genome copy. the T362I substitution in motif D lowers RdRp Fidelity by making the pre-chemistry conformational change for misincorporation more Efficient. motif D also contains the highly conserved Lys (for PV RdRp, Lys-359) templates contain six (or seven)-base pair duplex flanked by two-, four-, (or three)-nucleotide 5\u2032 overhangs. the rate and yield of competent RdRp-RNA complexes were identical for WT and T362I RdRp using either RNA template. RdRp and RNA were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 90 s at which time trap (100 m unlabeled RNA) was added to the reaction buffer. the reaction buffer was mixed with ATP or UTP (500 m) and then quenched after 30 s by adding EDTA (25 mm) 2I substitution led to more efficient misincorporation of incorrect NTP either with 2\u2032-dNTP (Fig. 3C) or incorrect nucleobase (Fig. 3D) this change resulted in lowered RdRp fidelity for both nucleobase and sugar selection (as evaluated by either kpol,correct/kpol,incorrect or (kpol/Kd,app)incorrect) T362I RdRp reveals that the T362I substitution decreases polymerase fidelity Variant NTP kpol KD,app kpol/KD,app kpol,correct/kpol,incorrect (kpol/KD)correct/(kpol/KD)incorrect s1 m m1s1 Correct NTP Sym/Sub-U RNA WT ATP 59 1 36 2 1.6 T362I ATP 67 1 the effect of Mn2+ and D2O on nucleotide incorporation kinetics can help distinguish changes to the pre-chemistry conformational change and/or the chemistry step. in the presence of Mn2+, the pre-chemistry conformational change becomes more efficient, and kpol is then fully rate-determined by the chemistry step (51). the T362I substitution in motif D lowers sugar and nucleobase selection by making the pre-chemistry conformational change more efficient. kinetics of correct ATP incorporation into sym/subU RNA in the presence of Mn2+ is very similar between WT () and T362I () RdRp. the SDKIEs for correct and incorrect incorporation were higher than the corresponding SDKIEs for WT RdRp. these findings suggest that chemistry is more rate-determining for the T362I variant compared with WT RdRp. the pre-chemistry conformational change is more efficient for T362I RdRp. the T362I substitution in motif D alters the conformational equilibrium between open and closed states of PV RdRp. HSQC spectra between WT RdRp bound with RNA lacking a 3\u2032-OH and correct UTP nucleotide (black), incorrect 2\u2032-dUTP nucleotide (red), or incorrect ATP nucleotide (blue) the most substantial change with the T362I RdRp spectra occurs in the presence of 2\u2032-dNTP (red spectrum in Fig. 5D) in this case two sets of resonances were observed, especially for Met-354, indicating that the enzyme is exchanging between two conformations on the slow NMR chemical shift timescale. the T362I substitution increases misincorporation rates through a more efficient pre-chemistry conformational change. the conformational equilibrium when RdRp is bound with NTP with incorrect nucleobase may also be altered. this statement is consistent with the Mn2+ effects and the diminished SDKIE. the side chain of Ile-362 is stabilized by van der Waals interactions with the side chain of the nearby Phe-363. the most perturbed residues were those of the motif D loop (i.e. amino acids 359\u2013365) the side chain of Glu-364 adopts a completely different conformation in the T362I structure relative to WT RdRp. the T362I substitution in motif D leads to structural and dynamics changes consistent with changes to RdRp function. the two structures were superimposed using C atoms. the proteins are depicted as ribbons, and the mutated residues Thr-362/Ile-362 are shown as sticks and labeled. the last 10 ns of the WT (gray line) and T362I (black line) trajectories are plotted. the points in the per-root mean square deviation plot corresponding to other Sabin sites are indicated by a dark red diamond (WT) and a dark red triangle (T362I) a more than 2-fold decrease in the concentration of ribavirin needed to reduce the number of plaques by half compared with the untreated population. this result is consistent with the kinetic results indicating that the T362I substitution decreases RdRp fidelity and would therefore more readily incorporate the antiviral nucleotide. mutant may be more attenuated in animals than WT PV. we compared the virulence of T362I and WT PVs in a mouse transgenic for the PV receptor (56) in this system, infection by WT PV is generally lethal. amino acid substitutions in helix O/P can lower polymerase accuracy (34\u201338) motif D undergoes conformational exchange on same timescale as catalysis (71, 72) viral strains carrying RdRp with reduced or enhanced fidelity are attenuated in mice (12\u201314, 33, 48, 55, 73) the MD simulations predict that the T362I substitution perturbs the interaction between Glu-364 and Lys-228, but a new interaction forms between Glu-364 and Asn-370. similar interactions between equivalent positions (may) form in other RdRps. non-covalent interactions occur between equivalent positions of Lys-228 and Glu337 in PV RdRp. amino acid substitutions remote from active site can alter polymerase catalysis and fidelity (48) this finding suggests there are long-range interaction networks important for modulating RdRp function (31, 42) design."}
