{"summary": "Background SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiologic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. cytokine response of two human non-lymphatic cell lines can determine the course of disease. interferons are potent, antivirally active cytokines which can be produced by most, if not all, body cells in response to virus infection. other virus-induced cytokines and chemokines activate the adaptive immune system and direct the migration of leukocytes [2]. etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) is the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) cytokines and chemokines IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10 are strongly upregulated. in some cases both IL-8 and IP-10 were upregulated [24], whereas in other cases only IL-8 [25,26], only IP-10 [27] or no cytokines were induced at all [24-26]. in this study, we identified an IFN-competent human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell clone which supports the growth of SARS-CoV. we investigated the production of representative cytokines, chemokines and antiviral genes. the chemokines IP-10 and IL-8 escaped suppression by SARS-CoV in Caco-2 cells, but not in HEK 293s. titers of HEK 293 cells and HEK 293 cells were comparable at 24 h post-infection and 48 h post-infection. titers in the supernatants were determined 24 h post-infection and 48 h post-infection by plaque assays. we deemed it necessary to monitor cytokine synthesis at 8 h and 16 h post-infection. clear signals for all IFNs were detected after infection with control viruses BdNSs, SeV and NDV. for SARS-CoV, only a weak signal for IFN- was detected in HEK 293 cells. it was of interest to see whether virus infection would lead to the upregulation of antiviral, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) RNA samples of Caco-2 cells (A) and HEK 293 cells (B) described in Fig. 2 were investigated by RT-PCR for the presence of different IFN mRNAs. the infection time had to be extended to 24 h. RNA samples of HEK 293 cells described in Fig. 2 were assayed by RT-PCR for IP-10 and RANTES mRNA levels. RANTES mRNA again was not detectable for SARS-CoV. cytokine-inducing viruses activated IP-10 and RANTES expression in HEK 293 cells as expected. RNA samples of HEK 293 cells were investigated by RT-PCR. the control viruses invariably induced both IL-6 and IL-8. this may suggest that the IL-8 detected in SARS patients is directly synthesized by infected resident cells. titers in the supernatants were determined 24 h post-infection and 48 h post-infection by plaque assays. we compared it with well-characterized cytokine inducers such as Bunyamwera delNSs virus (35) and Sendai virus (SeV) only a weak signal for IFN- was detected in HEK 293 cells. the -actin control mRNA was present in equal amounts. it was of interest to see whether virus infection would lead to the upregulation of antiviral, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) RNA samples of Caco-2 cells (A) and HEK 293 cells (B) described in Fig. 2 were investigated by RT-PCR. for detection of MxA mRNA in Caco-2 cells an extended infection period of 24 h was necessary. RNA samples of Caco-2 cells (A) and HEK 293 cells (B) described in Fig. 2 were assayed by RT-PCR. all three cytokine-inducing viruses activated IP-10 and RANTES expression in HEK 293 cells as expected. RANTES expression, by contrast, is never induced by SARS-CoV. RNA samples of Caco-2 cells (A) and HEK 293 cells (B) described in Fig. 2 were investigated by RT-PCR for the presence of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNAs. this may suggest that the IL-8 detected in SARS patients [18,19] is directly synthesized by infected resident cells. IL-6 is more likely a secondary response mediated by infiltrating immune cells. SARS-CoV-infected macrophages and dendritic cells lack IFN induction. IP-10 and IL-8, however, can be activated by SARS-CoV. this suggests that these chemokines are produced in response to IFN-. the virus buys time during the initial phase of infection in order to grow unhindered in the host. the virus-induced chemokines IP-10 and IL-8 attract immune cells. this mixture of high-level virus replication followed by the invasion of activated immune cells leads to a cytokine storm and the severe and potentially fatal respiratory distress. cDNA was amplified by 35 cycles of PCR. each cycle consisting of 30 sec at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 58\u00b0C. cells and viruses Simian VeroE6 cells, human Caco-2 cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK 293 cells) were maintained and grown as described [24,36] RT-PCR analyses Cells were infected for the indicated times. total RNA was extracted and treated with DNase I. cDNA was amplified by 35 cycles of PCR. each cycle consisting of 30 sec at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 58\u00b0C. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. all authors read and approved the manuscript."}
