{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Coronavirus genomes are plus-strand RNA molecules of around 30 kb (1, 2) and represent the largest known RNA viruses. the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome codifies the replicase polyprotein. the 3\u2032 third includes the structural protein genes and several accessory genes (3). discontinuous transcription of sgmRNAs in TGEV is driven by the transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) located at the 3\u2032 end of the leader (TRS-L) and preceding each gene (TRS-B) the TRS-L acts as the acceptor RNA during the template switch, while the TRS-B sequences act as the donor RNA. in this report, we describe the identification of a novel long-distance RNA-RNA interaction between a 10-nt sequence within the active domain and a complementary RNA (cRNA) motif. this interaction could bring into physical proximity the leader sequence and the TRS-N, which are located more than 25,000 nt apart. this proximity would facilitate the template switch during the synthesis of the minus-strand sgRNAs by a high-frequency recombination mechanism. pE, proximal element; dE, distal element; +1, first nucleotide of the N gene. numbers indicate the nucleotide positions in the TGEV genome. cDNAs encoding TGEV and replicons were constructed using reverse-genetic system. cellular RNA polymerase II transcribes virus or replicon genomes from pBAC vectors. transfected cells were grown to 95% confluence on 35-mm-diameter plates. transfected cells were transfected with 4 g of cDNA encoding a TGEV replicon or infectious virus. RNAs were purified with an RNeasy miniprep kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. each RNA sample was treated with DNase I (Roche) cDNAs were synthesized at 37\u00b0C for 2 h with multiScribe reverse transcriptase (high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit; Applied Biosystems) gRNA RT-REP-VS TTCTTTTGACAAAACATACGGTGAA RT-REP-RS nt 4,829 to 4,853; for RT-REP-RS, nt 4,884 to 4,909; for Ldrt-VS, nt 25 to 56; for N(82)-RS, nt 26,986 to 27,004. cDNAs of TGEV-derived replicons cB-218*/B, cB-477*/B, cB-218*/B, and cB-477*/B were obtained by using two overlapping fragments synthesized by PCR. the first fragment was generated with Oli 5\u2032I and the specific reverse oligonucleotide. the second fragment was generated with Oli 3\u2032D and the specific forward oligonucleotide rTGEV-B* cDNA was constructed using an intermediate plasmid. a smaller fragment including AvrII-MfeI sites at the ends was generated by PCR using pBAC-TGEV.

RNA affinity chromatography was performed using 5\u2032-biotinylated RNAs linked to a streptavidin-conjugated solid matrix. sixty microliters of solid matrix (10 g/l) was used per RNA binding assay. protein extracts diluted in H-BW solution were precleared three times by incubation with the solid matrix in an orbital shaker for at least 5 h each time. gels stained with Coomassie Simply Blue Safe stain (Invitrogen) images were taken with Image Lab V3.0 (Bio-Rad) potential base pairing score calculations were performed as previously described. TGEVs were obtained from an infective clone with the sequence of the isolated TGEV PUR46-MAD (25) and the spike protein of strain PTV (Purdue type strain) (26) by using a reverse-genetic system. cDNAs encoding TGEV and replicons were constructed using pBAC-TGEV (25) and the replicon pBAC-REP1 (28). cDNA was purified using a large-construct kit (Qiagen) 7 g of each RNA in 100 l was treated with 20 U of DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. total intracellular RNA was extracted from transfected BHK-N cells at 24 hpt or from ST cells infected with recombinant TGEVs. ronidase mRNA (GUS; Life Technologies) as an internal standard, as well as viral gRNA (29). Detection was performed with an ABI Prism 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) data were analyzed with an ABI Prism 7500 SDS, version 1.2.3, software. each mutant sequence, two independent replicons were constructed. cDNAs of TGEV-derived replicons cB-218*/B, cB-477*/B, cB-218*/B, and rTGEV-cB* were generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis. cDNAs of TGEV-derived replicons cB-218*/B, cB-477*/B, cB-218*/B, and cB-477*/B the ClaI-ClaI fragment was introduced into the same sites of corresponding pBAC-TGEV-Cla plasmids lacking the ClaI-ClaI fragment (AD-A and TRS-N-dE for replicons and pBAC-TGEV for infectious clones) the fragment was then introduced into bacterial artificial chromosomes to construct complete replicon or infectious cDNA clones including mutant sequences.

including two hairpins, is essential for N gene transcription. regions B and C are required to maintain N gene transcription levels. regions A, B, and C are indicated by circles. qRT-PCR analysis of N sgmRNA levels normalized to gRNA (N sgmRNA/gRNA) and referred to the level in the reference replicon TRS-N-dE, which was set at 1. dE-173-20, positive control. reference replicon TRS-N-dE was set at 1. 3\u2032AD-A, positive control. data are averaged for four independent transfection experiments analyzed twice. qRT-PCR analysis of N sgmRNA levels. no proteins specifically interacting with the B motif with a native or mutated sequence were identified by mass spectrometry. the alternative possibility of an interaction of the B motif with a cRNA sequence (cB) present within the viral genome was then analyzed. cB-477 RNA motif was mutated to 5\u2032-GACAGGAAAG-3\u2032. mutations at the 5\u2032 end of the genome were designed to preserve the amino acid sequence. mutations at the 5\u2032 end of

nonspecific competitor. protein interacting with the wild-type sequence (AD-B) but not the mutant sequence (AD-B\u20329) were not found. normalized to gRNA in relation to reference levels in replicons wt/B, cB-218*/B, and cB-477*/B, which were set at 1. wt/B, positive control. a new replicon (cB-477*/B*) was constructed by introducing point mutations in the B motif (5\u2032-UCUUACGAUU-3\u2032 was changed to 5\u2032-UUUUCCUGUU-3\u2032) levels of sgmRNA 7 were analyzed by qRT-PCR with replicons including mutations in the cB-477 and cB-477 motifs. deletion of the B motif (replicons wt/B, cB-218*/B, and cB-477*/B) did not significantly affect sgmRNA 7 levels compared to those with the wild-type sequence (wt/B) viral titers and viral titers for both rTGEV-cB* and -B* were significantly reduced (4-fold for the N sgmRNA level and 100-fold for the viral titer) the sequence at position 482 in rTGEV-cB* had reverted to the wild-type sequence (Fig. 7B) viral sequences at nt 477 to 486 and 26,412 to 26,421 along passages in cell culture. reversion to wild-type sequence and substitutions are indicated by lowercase letters. data are averages for four independent infection experiments

RNA-RNA interaction. the predicted stability for each interaction is indicated as G (kcal/mol) replicon including the complete active domain, previously named dE-173-20 (21), indicating that region A is not necessary for active domain function. regions B and C are required to maintain N gene transcription levels. regions B and C are indicated by circles. qRT-PCR analysis of N sgmRNA levels (N

sgmRNA/gRNA) in relation to the level in the reference replicon TRS-N-dE. no proteins specifically interacting with the B motif with a native or mutated sequence were identified by mass spectrometry. cB-218*/B mutant was modified at 8 positions to disrupt the complementarity with the active domain B motif. original sequence, located at nt 477 to 486 (5\u2032-GAUCGUAAGG-3\u2032), was mutated to 5\u2032-GACAGGAAAG-3\u2032. mutations at the 5\u2032 end of the genome were designed to preserve the amino acid sequence. cB sequence motif in nt 218 to 229 does not maintain original N sgmRNA levels. cB sequence motif in nt 218 to 229 is not required for N gene transcription. analysis by qRT-PCR of sgmRNA levels normalized to gRNA in relation to reference levels in replicons wt/B, cB-218*/B, and cB-477*/B, which were set at 1. wt/B, positive control. data are averages for four independent transfection experiments analyzed twice by qRT-PCR. cB-477*/B* and cB-477*/B*-14 mutants were significantly higher than those in the positive control. the complementarity between the cB-477 and B motifs was required for transcriptional regulation of N sgmRNA. levels of sgmRNA 7 were analyzed by qRT-PCR with replicons including mutations in the B and cB-477 motifs. a region extending 1,000 nt over the mutated positions of the recombinant viruses was sequenced after one virus passage in ST cells. only the originally introduced mutations were observed in mutant viruses. the mutant virus rTGEV-B* had reverted to the wild-type sequence. viral sequences at nt 477 to 486 and 26,412 to 26,421 are shown inside boxes. lowercase letters indicate mutated positions. data are averages for four independent infection experiments analyzed twice. the sequences of RNA motifs B and cB involved in the novel RNA-RNA interaction are conserved among the Alphacoronavirus I species. the secondary structure of the 5\u2032-end genomic region, including the cB motif at the apical loop, is conserved according to Mfold predictions (Fig. 8B), suggesting a functional conservation in these CoV species. protein containing the B motif was conserved at nucleotide and amino acid levels in Alphacoronavirus I species. similar structures at similar genome positions have not been found in other species of the Alphacoronavirus genus. the interaction between the proximal and distal elements, located within the transcription-regulating sequences of the N gene, relocates the active domain with a proper conformation to a site immediately preceding the N gene CS. the physical proximity of CS-L and CS-N sequences favors the template switch necessary for discontinuous transcription, increasing the frequency of this long-distance recombination. the previously proposed working model of coronavirus transcription (17) includes three steps. the second step is the formation of a complex among the TRS-L, the TRS-B, and the nascent cTRS-B. the third step resumes the synthesis of RNA to obtain a complete negative-strand sgRNA. motifs involved in this network of RNA-RNA interactions support the existence and relevance of these interactions in coronavirus transcription. in the nonrelated tombusvirus tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), RNA-RNA interactions relocate just before each gene. the secondary structure of the active domain and the high-order structure formed by the RNA-RNA interactions could also promote the slowdown and stop of the transcription complex."}
