{"summary": "a macroscopic spatial analysis of HCV infection can provide scientific information for further intervention and disease control. results Over 770,000 identified HCV infection cases had specific geographic information during the study period (2005\u20132011) there are more than 150 million people with chronic liver disease which were caused by HCV infection in 2012. over 350,000 people has been dead from HCV-related diseases worldwide each year. the prevention of HCV infection has been a great challenge, especially in china. china has established a world's largest web-based disease reporting system. the system can provide both the number of HCV infection cases and the spatial distribution information of these cases across the country. all HCV infection cases, identified during 2005 to 2011 in CISDCP, were included. data in this study was based on HCV regular monitoring system in china. ethics committee and government have approved for the system to collect patient data. general Moran's Index formula was calculated as: [12]: Where n is the number of spatial units (cities), xi and xj were the observations from unit i to unit j about the phenomenon X; wij represents the adjacent weight matrix. if the unit i was adjacent to the unit j, then wij would be 1; otherwise, it would be 0. all medical institutions should report diagnosed HCV infection cases to specific local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through CISDCP. Demographic information (age, gender, address, registered residency places, time of onset of the disease etc.) were collected using standardized case report forms (CRFs) by conducting private interviews. general spatial autocorrelation test statistic is a technique which is able to measure and analyze the spatial clusters in the data. the value of general Moran's Index was set between [1, 1] and [1, 1]. the method was initially created to detect the clustering of cases of rare diseases. if Z-value was>1.96, the local clusters can be identified as low-value correlation (statistically significant hotspot, meaning the city had a high number of cases as well) we conducted local spatial autocorrelation at city level to detect the hotspots and coldspots of HCV infection in mainland China. the ratio of diagnosis type (Clinical diagnosis/Laboratory diagnosis) was also presented decreasing trend during study period, from 0.47 in 2005 to 0.12 in 2011 (Z-value = 130.47, P0.001). Spatial analysis The geographical distribution of identified HCV infection cases was found to be unbalanced in the mainland of China. index was increasing from 2005 to 2011 in general, meaning the strength of clustering of HCV cases got severer year by year. hotspots concentrated in areas where there was huge number of HCV infection cases, for example, Henan province and Jilin province etc. hotspots and coldspots of HCV infection in china from 2005 to 2011. hotspots coldspots year number (city level) Province, Municipality or Autonomous region where the hotspots located. 7,568 cases (accounting for 0.98% of all identified) were excluded from the present study due to lack of spatial information. increased trend of number of identified HCV infection cases with years was observed. the total number of HCV identified cases in these five regions is 340,209. the total number of HCV identified cases in these five regions is 340,209. the total number of HCV identified cases in these five regions is 43.91%. hotspots concentrated in areas where there was huge number of HCV infection cases, for example, henan province and Jilin province etc. but new hotspots were also observed in Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin and other provinces. study showed that not only the identified number of HCV cases in mainland China increased, but also the cases tended to more clustering. the reported incidence of HCV infection in China was gradually increased during 1997 to 2011, especially since CISDCP was established in 2004. in the present study, the proportion of people aged more than 30 years old was increasing by year, so older people became more likely to get infected by HCV. the number of cities which reported HCV infection cases remained stable by year, with the number of infection cases increasing in the same period. hotspots were observed in central and border areas from 2005 to 2011. the poor economy and low level of health status facilitated HCV infection in this area during the period (2005\u20132011) the coldspots were confined to three provinces in this study, Tibet, Qinghai, and Jiangxi. this phenomenon might due to life style and religion of Tibet. the poor health system to have enough capacity to detect HCV cases might also be a reason."}
