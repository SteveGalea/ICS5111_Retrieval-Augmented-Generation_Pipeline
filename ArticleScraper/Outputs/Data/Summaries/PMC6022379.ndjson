{"summary": "the disease can be diagnosed by isolation followed by fluorescent antibody tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. the real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for rapid, early and accurate diagnosis of WNV. o cells in accordance with the standard protocol in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma, USA) supplemented with 10 per cent tryptose phosphate broth (TPB)16. TPB (DIFCO, USA), 10 per cent foetal bovine serum (Sigma, USA), 3 per cent L-glutamine and gentamicin (80 mg/l) were purchased. one-step RT-PCR was performed targeting the envelope gene of WNV. the amplification was carried out in a 50 l reaction volume using a one-step RT-PCR kit. the thermal profile of RT-PCR reaction was 48\u00b0C for 45 min, 95\u00b0C for 5 min. real-time monitoring of RT-LAMP amplification was performed in loopamp real-time Turbidimeter (LA-200, Teramecs, Japan) positive and negative controls were included in each experiment. a sample having Tp values of 45 min and turbidity above the threshold value of 0.1 was considered positive. a panel of positive serum samples of DEN (n=35) and chikungunya (n=25) were also included as negative control. correlation, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values were calculated17. the thermal profile of RT-PCR reaction was 48\u00b0C for 45 min, 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for one min, 62\u00b0C for one min, 72\u00b0C for one min and final extension cycle at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. the sequences of the selected primers were compared to an alignment of the E gene sequences of 14 strains of WNV. assay was determined by taking into account the time of positivity (Tp; in min) at which the turbidity increased above the threshold value fixed at 0.1. however, a sample having Tp values of 45 min and turbidity above the threshold value of 0.1 was considered positive. the observance for amplification was performed through colour change by addition of 1 l of SYBR Green I dye to the tube. RNA was extracted from 140 l of infected culture supernatant and patient serum/plasma samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) the RNA was eluted from QIAspin columns in a final volume of 100 l of elution buffer and stored at 70\u00b0C until used. one-step RT-PCR was performed targeting the envelope gene of WNV. inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP), 5 pmol each of loop primers F3 and B3, 25 pmol each of loop primers forward loop primer and backward loop primer and 2 l of RNA template. the sequences of the selected primers were compared to an alignment of the E gene sequences of 14 strains of WNV. the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay was determined by testing serial 10-fold dilutions of virus compared with that of conventional RT-PCR. the detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was 10-fold higher than conventional RT-PCR. the real-time kinetics of the RT-LAMP was studied at 63\u00b0C by monitoring turbidity. the results indicated that the time required for initiation of amplification was 17 minutes. it was also observed that there was continuous amplification of the target sequence in a step-wise gradient manner. incubation was carried out at 63\u00b0C for 30 minutes. positive samples showed green fluorescence while negative samples retained orange colour. negative samples retained orange colour while adding 1 l of nucleic acid dye. the development of fluorogenic PCR utilizing 5\u2019-3\u2019 nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase made it possible to eliminate post-PCR processing such as visualization in agarose7. but all these nucleic acid amplification methods have several intrinsic disadvantages of requiring either a high precision instrument for amplification or an elaborate complicated method for the detection of amplified products. -LAMP assay was rapid as its result appeared after one hour. requires only a regular laboratory water bath and is therefore suitable as a routine diagnostic tool in private clinics and field applications."}
