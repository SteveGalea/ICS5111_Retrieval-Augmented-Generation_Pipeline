{"summary": "DENV is transmitted by aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. the virus causes dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) the mortality rate increases to >20% in the absence of proper treatment. a strain of A. albopictus, known to transmit DENV, has been identified. a clinical trial of about 30,000 people conducted in 10 countries showed that the vaccine may cause serious symptoms in patients. the immunology and pathology of DENV have not yet been elucidated. development status of dengue Sensitive Mouse Model DENV-susceptible mouse models have been developed by genetically modifying the immune system to maintain the infected state. however, this model has limitations related to the immune response, and it is not applicable to all DENV serotypes. the use of primate species as experimental models also has limitations, including the high cost and challenges of managing them. Species Immune status Name Routes of infection Infective dose Detectable viremia Anti-DENV immune responses DENV-induced disease Mouse Immunocompetent Humanized BALB/c IP 105 /+ Ab (/+), T cell - hNOD/SCID SC 104 + Ab (/+) Fever, rash, thrombocytopenia hRAG2-/-c-/- IP, SC 106 + Ab Fever, rash, shock SC SCID-PBL, SCID mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes. the currently available immunodeficient/knockout mouse models include SCID mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes. NOD/SCID-hu models are more relevant for DENV infection than SCID-PBL models. a model in which human cells were transplanted into NOD/SCID mice lacking T, B, and natural killer cells. a NOD/SCID/IL-2Rcc-/- mouse model was developed that shows human-like disease patterns. STAT-/- mice showed susceptibility to DENV type 2 and presented viruses in plasma, the liver, spleen, and nervous system. rhesus macaque and chimpanzees showed detectable viremia. both models showed anti-DENV immune responses including T-cell responses. but chimpanzee models do not show symptoms of DENV. a large number of immunological reagents are available for swine models. this swine model has similar physiological, immunologic, metabolic, and skin physical properties. this swine model has similar cardiovascular, immunologic, metabolic, and skin physical properties. a significant decrease in DENV infection was observed when DCs were treated with an anti-DC-SIGN antibody. the development of a DENV infection disease model through transformation will broaden the possibilities for vaccine development by making it possible to overcome various obstacles. many countries, including the united states, are making efforts to establish vaccine development systems using animal models. a dengue-sensitive animal model will provide an accurate profile of the efficacy and side effects of vaccines and candidate drugs in preclinical trials. the availability of such a system should reduce the risk of development failure and minimize the barriers to entry of small domestic companies into vaccine research. the deNV vaccine market is expected to reach a combined $398.6 million in 2020. there will be a significant economic impact that could be extended to Zika virus and West Nile virus in the future."}
