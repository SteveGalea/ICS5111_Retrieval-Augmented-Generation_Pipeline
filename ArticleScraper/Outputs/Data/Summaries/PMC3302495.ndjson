{"summary": "coVs are found in a wide variety of animals, in which they can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases of varying severity. a novel human CoV (HCoV) of the genus Alphacoronavirus, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), was reported independently by two groups in 2004 (12, 44) in 2005, we described the discovery, complete genome sequence, clinical features, and molecular epidemiology of another novel HC at least nine other novel CoVs were discovered, including two novel subgroups in Betacoronavirus, subgroups C and D (26, 37, 45, 51), and additional novel CoVs were discovered and complete genomes sequenced (4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13\u201315, 17, 21, 31, 32, 34, 43, 53) all specimens of bats, cats, dogs, wild rodents, monkeys, and birds were collected with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, HKSAR. all specimens of Asian leopard cats were collected in the Guangdong province of southern china over an 8-month period (February 2007 to June 2011) a total of 7,140 samples from 11 species of bats, 169 pigs, 230 cats, 231 dogs, 47 cattle, 221 chickens, 389 rod initial coV screening was performed by amplifying a 440-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of CoVs using deltacoronavirus conserved primers (5\u2032-GTGGVTGTMTTAATGCACAGTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TACTGYCTGTTRGTCATRGTG-3\u2032) PCR mixture (25 l) contained cDNA, PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, porcine coronavirus HKU15 (PorCoV HKU15) and one complete genome each of white-eye coronavirus HKU16 (WECoV HKU16), sparrow coronavirus HKU17 (SpCoV HKU17), night heron coronavirus HKU19 (NHCoV HKU19), wigeon coronavirus HKU20 (WiCoV HKU20) and common moorhen coronavirus HKU21 (CMCo diversgence times for four genera of CoVs, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus were calculated using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. one parametric model (Constant Size) and one nonparametric model (Bayesian Skyline) tree priors were used for the inference. the nucleotide sequences of the eight genomes of PorCoV HKU15, WECoV HKU16, SpCoV HKU17, NHCoV HKU18, NHCoV HKU19, WiCoV HKU20, and CMCoV HKU21 have been lodged in the GenBank sequence database under accession no. JQ065042 to JQ065049. RNA was eluted in 50 l of RNase-free water and was used as the template for reverse transcription-PCR. initial coV screening was performed by amplifying a 440-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of CoVs using deltacoronavirus conserved primers. PCR mixture (25 l) contained cDNA, PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 two complete genomes of porcine coronavirus HKU15 (PorCoV HKU15) and one complete genome each of white-eye coronavirus HKU16 (WECoV HKU16), sparrow coronavirus HKU17 (SpCoV HKU17), magpie robin coronavirus HKU18 (MRCoV HKU18), night heron coronavirus HKU19 (NHCoV HKU19), wigeon coronavirus HKU phylogenetic tree construction was performed using neighbor joining method. protein family analysis was performed using PFAM and interProScan (1, 2). Divergence times for the four genera of CoVs were calculated. a total of 7,140 respiratory and alimentary specimens from 3,298 dead wild birds, 221 chickens, and 3,137 mammals were obtained. RT-PCR for a 440-bp fragment in the RdRp genes of CoVs was positive in specimens from 17 pigs and 35 dead wild birds. no positive results were obtained from any of the 15 Asian leopard cats, 434 bats, 230 cats, 47 cattle, 221 chickens, 231 dogs, 1,387 humans b 30 0 Bat Rectal swab 434 0 Birda Rectal swab 3,306 35 (1.1%) WECoV HKU16 (n = 3), SpCoV HKU17 (n = 7), MRCoV HKU18 (n = 1), CMCoV HKU21 (n = 1), BuCoV HKU11 (n = 10), ThCoV HKU12 (n = 1), MunCoV HKU13 (n = 6) Scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 (NC_009657); TGEV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (NC_002306); FIPV, feline infectious peritonitis virus (AY994055); PRCV, porcine respiratory coronavirus (DQ811787); Rh-BatCoV-HKU2, Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 (EF203064); Mi-BatCoV 1A, Miniopter ylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (NC_009019); Pi-BatCoV-HKU5, Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (NC_009020); SARS CoV, SARS-related human coronavirus (NC_004718); SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3, SARS-related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU3 (DQ022305) genomes of the seven novel mammalian and avian CoVs ranged from 25,416 bases (PorCoV HKU15) to 26,674 (MRCoV HKU18) and their G+C contents ranged from 35% (CMCoV HKU21) to 47% (MRCoV HKU18). both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends contain short untranslated regions. nsp3 contains putative papain-like protease (PLpro), nsp12 (putative RdRp), nsp13 (putative helicase) and other proteins of unknown functions. the amino acids upstream to the putative cleavage sites at nsp2/nsp3, nsp3/nsp4, and nsp4/nsp5 are all AG, AG, and LQ for PorCoV HKU15 Rp Hel S N 3CLpro RdRp Hel S N 3CLpro RdRp Hel S N Alphacoronavirus PEDV 28,033 0.42 35.8 48.7 49.3 38.0 23.4 37.4 49.3 47.8 38.7 22.4 36.5 48.9 48.9 39.2 24.1 36.8 48.9 49.1 40.8 22.3 37.2 48.8 48.9 39.2 24.1 36.8 48.9 49 41.9 23.7 33.7 49.1 49.4 49.4 40.1 21.8 HCoV-229E 27,317 0.38 34.4 49.3 50.6 42.5 21.6 35.4 49.0 48.3 42.4 22.5 34.2 49.5 50.2 45.5 23.0 34.8 49.3 49.8 44.0 22.5 34.6 49.2 49.0 39.9 20.4 36.3 49.6 49.6 44.1 21.5 34.8 48.6 47.5 43.2 22.8 8 51.1 38.2 23.8 31.9 49.8 48.2 35.7 22.3 35.7 49.6 48.9 35.7 24.1 32.8 47.7 48.3 38.2 22.8 Mi-BatCoV-HKU8 28,773 0.42 33.1 49.3 49.3 49.8 35.9 19.4 36.0 49.9 47.5 36.0 18.8 33.4 49.6 49.3 38.9 20.4 34.4 49.3 49.3 49.3 40.4 26.9 22.1 38.1 51.6 48.6 26.1 23.1 38.5 51.6 48.3 27.2 22.3 37.8 51.4 48.3 26.9 22.2 34.4 54.5 48.5 26.1 22.7 38.7 51.7 48.5 27.1 21.6 38.2 51.6 49.0 25.4 24.1 AntelopeCoV 30,995 0.37 38.5 51.8 48.4 25.8 22.9 38.8 51.7 48.5 25.6 21.7 38.5 51.8 48.4 3 26.1 25.2 38.0 51.4 48.2 26.4 24.8 37.9 51.3 49.4 25.7 26.0 36.4 51.4 48.8 26.4 26.0 36.3 54.4 47.4 25.4 26.0 36.3 54.4 47.4 25.4 24.7 38.1 50.9 48.5 25.8 22.7 38.3 51.2 47.8 25.0 25.4 25.8 22.7 38.3 51.2 47.8 25.0 25.4 25.8 22.7 38.3 51.2 47. 50.2 50.6 28.0 24.7 34.2 51.0 51.6 25.5 25.6 34.2 50.7 51.4 25.2 26.2 32.1 50.4 50.2 25.9 22.7 34.8 49.9 50.3 26.8 24.3 32.9 50.7 51.0 27.2 24.8 Subgroup C Ty-BatCoV-HKU4 30,286 0.38 36.9 51.2 49.8 26.6 25.1 36.6 51.0 49.4 26.1 24.7 36.9 51.5 49.7 27.0 2 43.6 54.9 57.1 30.1 29.2 43.3 54.5 55.3 30.3 29.6 43.9 55.0 57.1 29.5 29.5 42.3 54.4 57.1 30.3 29.2 44.3 53.8 55.3 30.3 30.3 30.0 46.2 52.8 55.4 30.3 29.9 41.3 53.6 55.8 30.6 28.2 BWCoV-SW1 31,686 0.39 38.8 52.9 52.8 27.1 32.1 39.5 52.9 51.6 28.3 31.1 38 44.0 53.2 72.0 84.7 85.4 52.2 64.4 PorCoV HKU15 25,421 0.43 76.9 88.1 88.4 61.9 75.8 97.0 97.8 99.2 44.8 96.8 84.3 90.6 96.1 44.4 77.9 54.0 72.5 78.2 41.8 52.2 57.7 71.0 74.9 43.8 52.4 73.6 84.5 84.6 50.1 62.0 WECoV HKU16 26,027 0.40 57.7 71.0 74.9 43.8 52.4 59.6 71.5 74.3 43.4 50.6 58.0 71.0 75.1 45.8 53.2 56.4 71.2 75.1 46.3 53.1 58.3 69.3 75.4 41.0 54.5 58.3 75.4 41.0 54.5 58.3 75.4 41.0 54.5 58.3 75.4 41.1 57.0 CMCoV HKU21 26,216 0.35 73.6 84.5 84.6 50.1 62.0 76. miniopterus bat coronavirus 1A, miniopterus bat coronavirus 1A, Mi-BatCoV-HKU8, Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8.

NS7b of WiCoV HKU20, and NS7d of WiCoV HKU20 were also found to be homologous to the NS3b of IBV and hypothetical protein of goose coronavirus. in all the seven domains, the amino acid sequences of PorCoV HKU15 and SpCoV HKU17 showed more than 90% identity, indicating that these two coronaviruses should be subspecies of the same species. for all five genes, the seven novel CoVs possessed higher amino acid identities to each other. in all five trees, the seven novel CoVs were clustered with BuCoV HKU11, ThCoV HKU12, and MunCoV HKU13. 2% base differences between the Hel, S, and N genes of PorCoV and those of the Asian leopard cat coronavirus were found. the mean evolutionary rate of CoVs was estimated at 1.3 104 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the RdRp gene. the tMRCA of all CoVs was estimated at 8100 BC (HPDs, 20607 to 974 BC), that of Alphacoronavirus at 2400 BC (HPDs, 7659 to 722 BC), that of Betacoronavirus at 3300 BC (HPDs, 9713 to 447 BC), and at least nine CoVs are present in our locality. complete genome sequences are available for eight. we hypothesize that there should be previously unrecognized CoVs in birds. the bird CoV lineage jumped to another species of bat, giving rise to Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus. the bird CoV jumped to other bird species and occasionally to some mammalian species, such as whale and pig. all 10 members of Deltacoronavirus have a very small genome size. only one papain-like protease domain is observed in the nsp3 gene of their genomes. NHCoV HKU19, WiCoV HKU20, and CMCoV HKU21 occupied the first three branches. a deletion of 3\u2032 Ns7a and Ns7b occurred during interspecies jumping from birds to pigs. this is similar to the observation of interspecies jumping of SARS-CoV from civets to humans. the sequences of these gene fragments differ from the corresponding ones in PorCoV by less than 2.1% nucleotides or 1.7% amino acids."}
