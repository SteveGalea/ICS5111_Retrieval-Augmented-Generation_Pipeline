{"summary": "infection causes dengue and severe dengue (also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever) nearly 400 million cases annually. thrombocytopenia is a frequently observed manifestation of DENV infection significantly associated with severe dengue patients. enia resulting from the suppression of bone marrow and platelet synthesis has been observed in both human patients15 and deNV-infected humanized mice. also, direct infection of the bone marrow MKs by DENV has been demonstrated in a nonhuman primate model and in dengue patients17-19. the production of viral particles in MK\u2013erythrocyte progenitor cells20 has also been demonstrated. a colony-forming unit (CFU-MK assay) was performed in vitro using human cord blood-derived CD34+ cells and mouse bone marrow cells. all experimental protocols related to animal studies were conducted in accordance with the national guidelines of the Animal Protection Act (Taiwan) plasmid Den2E3/pET28a was induced to express recombinant protein at 37\u00b0C for 4 h by adding isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside at a 1 mM final concentration. recombinant protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal-affinity chromatography matrices. lysis buffer (2 mM reduced glutathione, 0.2 mM oxidized glutathione, 80 mM glycine, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was used as the control protein. the expression plasmid pGEX-2KS28,29 was transformed into the E. coli mice with a body weight of 25 g were treated with DENV (0.6\u20131.2 105 PFU/mouse) through a retro-orbital injection twice every 24 h or treated with recombinant GST or DENV-EIII protein (3 mg/kg, equal to 37.5\u201342.9 g/ml in the circulation. mice treated with saline at the same volume were used as controls. 1 106 MKs were incubated with 25 g of purified recombinant DENV-EIII protein at 4\u00b0C for 1 h in 250 L of MK buffer with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) cells were stained with anti-CD61 antibody conjugated with allophycocyanin, anti-DENV-EIII antibody, and the IgG-purified from preimmunized rabbit serum at 4\u00b0C for 30 min in 300 L of MK buffer s were treated with DENV-EIII (25 g/mL) and GST protein (25 g/mL) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 12 d. methylcellulose (3.75 g/L) was added for 4\u20135 d to slow cell movement and increase cell number. all experimental protocols related to animal studies were conducted in accordance with the national guidelines of the Animal Protection Act (Taiwan) all experimental protocols related to animal studies were conducted in accordance with the national guidelines of the Animal Protection Act (Taiwan) the inclusion body containing DENV-EIII obtained after sonication in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA) was denatured by 8 M urea. the cell lysate and Ni-NTA resin were incubated in a binding buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM NaH2PO4, and 10 mM Tris-HCl; pH = 8) endotoxin contamination was verified through the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate assay (Lonza), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 28,31 Antibodies generation and purification Antibodies against DENV-EIII were generated and purified following the procedure detailed in a previous study. mice treated with saline at the same volume for the same time course were used as controls. recombinant mouse thrombopoietin (rmTPO, PeproTech) was added to the differentiation medium. cells were stained with anti-CD61 antibody conjugated with allophycocyanin, anti-DENV-EIII antibody, and the IgG-purified from preimmunized rabbit serum at 4\u00b0C for 30 min in 300 L of MK buffer with 3% BSA. after washing with PBS, cells were dissolved in 500 L of PBS and analyzed using flow cytometry. CD34+ cells were treated with DENV-EIII (25 g/mL) or GST protein (25 g/mL) on days 0, 4, 8, and 12 and were incubated with an MK differentiation medium. Flow cytometry was used to monitor MK differentiation and apoptosis. mice were treated with DENV-EIII every 12 h for 3 cycles. compared with saline and GST-treated groups, mice showed significantly lower counts of R1 cells and a lower percentage of polyploid cells in the R1 region. a similar response was observed in DENV-treated mice. mice were retro-orbitally injected with DENV-EIII. Flow cytometry analyses were performed on BM cells at 48 h (C) after the first injection. data are reported as the mean SD and represent 3\u20134 independent experiments. western blot analysis revealed that anti-DENV-EIII antibody specifically bound to DENV-EIII. the percentages of CD61 and DENV-EIII double positive cells are significantly increased when compared with controls without adding DENV-EIII or anti-DENV-EIII antibodies. DENV-EIII suppressed megakaryopoiesis in human haematopoietic progenitor cells. compared with marrow, human umbilical cord blood is a relatively more accessible resource for haematopoietic progenitor cells. deNV-EIII suppressed megakaryopoiesis in human cord blood CD34+ cells by autophagy impairment and apoptosis. dev-EIII decreased cell number in the R1 region and increased cell number in the R2 region. the intensity of Cyto-ID in the R2 region was lower than that in the R1 region in the DENV-EIII treated groups. results indicate that DENV-EIII triggers impaired autophagy. annexin V and activated caspase-3 staining was performed in flow cytometry. hypoploid cells increased in the DENV-EIII-treated groups (E) summarized events of (C), (D) and (E) are shown in (F) and (G), respectively. data are reported as the mean SD and represent 3\u20135 independent experiments. opoiesis is associated with autophagy impairment and apoptosis of differentiated MKs. the presence of additional mechanisms, such as the infection and replication of DENV in MKs and/or the nearby supporting bone marrow stroma cells, remains possible. unlike humans, mice are not native hosts of DENV. deficiency of Atg7 resulted in mitochondrial damage, followed by apoptosis in mouse erythrocytes and mature T lymphocytes. further investigation is warranted to elucidate the detailed mechanism through which DENV-EIII induces impaired autophagy and apoptosis. deNV-EIII-induced megakaryopoiesis suppression is one of causes of thrombocytopenia observed in deNV infection. dev-EIII could be considered a drug target to treat MK defects in severe dengue. DENV suppressed megakaryopoiesis in vivo. the experimental outlines are indicated (A) C57BL/6J mice were retro-orbitally injected with DENV. saline and recombinant GST protein were used as controls. s of polyploid cells (DNA content 4 N) in R1 region are shown (E). data are reported as the mean SD and represent 3\u20134 independent experiments. deNV-EIII killed differentiated MKs derived from mouse bone marrow. erythrocyte-depleted fraction was isolated and triggered to differentiate into MKs. compared with murine bone marrow, human umbilical cord blood is a relatively more accessible resource for haematopoietic progenitor cells. DENV-EIII suppressed megakaryopoiesis in human haematopoietic progenitor cells. Flow cytometry and PI staining revealed that the percentages of CD61+ (premature MK), CD61+/CD42b+ (mature MK) and sub-G1 cells in the R2 region were increased significantly in the DENV-EIII-treated groups compared with the vehicle and GST-treated groups. this suggests that DENV-EIII suppresses megakaryopoiesis partly by initiating cell death in premature and mature MKs. deNV-EIII suppresses megakaryopoiesis in human cord blood CD34+ cells. annexin V and activated caspase-3 staining were performed in flow cytometry. the 488-nm-excitable Cyto-ID green fluorescent reagents were used to monitor the autophagic cells in the R1 and R2 regions (A) Annexin V-allophycocyanin (B) and an antibody against activated caspase-3 conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (C) were used to investigate the apoptotic changes in DENV-EIII-treated cells through flow cytometry. deficiency of Atg7 led to mitochondrial damage, followed by apoptosis in mouse erythrocytes and mature T lymphocytes. deficiency of Atg7 led to mitochondrial damage, followed by apoptosis in mouse erythrocytes and mature T lymphocytes. DENV-EIII induces impaired autophagy and apoptosis in differentiated MKs. further investigation is warranted to elucidate the detailed mechanism through which DENV-EIII induces impaired autophagy and apoptosis. the authors are grateful to Prof. Nien-Tsung Lin (Department of Immunology, Tzu Chi University, Taiwan) for generously providing the plasmid Den2E3/pET21b to reconstruct the Den2E3/pET28a plasmid for generation Den2E3 recombinant protein. we wish to appreciate Dr. Chi-Yuan Liao and the teams in Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Mennonite Christian Hospital for"}
