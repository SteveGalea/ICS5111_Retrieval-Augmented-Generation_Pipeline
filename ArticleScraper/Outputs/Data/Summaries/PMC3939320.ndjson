{"summary": "the introduction Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an avian paramyxovirus belonging to the Avulavirus genus1. it is an economically relevant and thus widely researched and surveilled zoonotic agent. it has also been thoroughly studied beyond the veterinarian field. research on NDV greatly benefited from the development of reverse genetics techniques. reporter-expressing NDV have been used for the evaluation of innate immune responses as well as the identification of interferon antagonist encoded by multiple viruses18-27. the rescue process of a recombinant, non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA virus basically consists on artificially forcing a viral replication cycle in a producing cell by transfecting cDNA encoding the minimal infective molecular machinery. the cDNA can be manipulated by standard cloning procedures in order to generate desired modifications. the cDNA encodes eight different proteins into six transcriptional units. the new transcriptional unit within the genome must be carefully chosen. the sequence of the transgene should be checked to find possible GE and GS like sequences. if present, these sequences must be removed by silent mutagenesis. in the system all DNA constructs are under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. this cytoplasmic polymerase is provided in trans by coinfection. infect mammalian cells with the MVA-T7 virus at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 1 pfu/cell in a final volume of 200 l in PBS/BA/PS for 1 hr at room temperature. mix 1-2 g of OptiMEM with 250 l of pCAGGs-GFP per rescue attempt. incubate the infected/transfected cells for 6-8 hr (or overnight) at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. add 1 ml of DMEM 10% FBS/PS to each dish. replace transfection media with 1.5 ml of fresh DMEM 10% FBS/PS. trypsinize avian cells with 1 ml of DMEM 10% FBS/PS, 5% allantoic fluid, 30 mM MgCl2. incubate for 1-2 min at 37 \u00b0C until cells detach. Gently shake by hand the co-cultured cells in the 100 mm tissue culture dish. spray 70% ethanol over the eggs to establish sterile conditions. incubate the eggs for 2-3 days at 37 \u00b0C. the presence of virus in the allantoic fluid from infected eggs can be determined macroscopically by their ability to hemagglutinate turkey red blood cells (RBC) in the case of NDV, approximately 106 plaque forming units (pfu) per ml are required to give a positive signal in the HA assay. GFP18 aimed to monitor transfection and MVA-T7 infection efficiencies. mix 1-2 g of LPF2000 with 250 l of OptiMEM per rescue attempt. incubate for 5 min at room temperature, add 250 l of the. incubate the infected/transfected cells for 6-8 hr (or overnight) at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 and then replace the transfection media with 1.5 ml of fresh DMEM 10% FBS/PS. at 24 hr post-transfection, control wells can be observed under a fluorescence microscope. 0.2 ml of EDTA-trypsin until cells detach. trypsinize avian cells with 1 ml of DMEM 10% FBS/PS, 5% allantoic fluid, 30 mM MgCl2. incubate for 1-2 min at 37 \u00b0C until cells detach. spray 70% ethanol over the eggs to establish sterile conditions. seal the nick in the eggshell with melted wax or paraffin. incubate the eggs for 2-3 days at 37 \u00b0C. the presence of virus in the allantoic fluid from infected eggs can be determined macroscopically by their ability to hemagglutinate turkey red blood cells. approximately 106 plaque forming units (pfu) per ml are required to give a positive signal in the HA assay. a minimum titer of 106 pfu/ml is required to have a positive HA result. lower viral titers can still be detected by immunofluorescence assay. the RNA polymerase transcribes the RNA- genome into the different mRNAs of the viral proteins and into a complementary, full length antigenomic RNA+ copy. a whole cycle can start anew, ending with the release of recombinant viruses. whole cassette introduced into the NDV cDNA needs to have a total number of nucleotides divisible by six to follow the \"rule of six\"33 that drives efficient replication of most paramyxovius genomes. cells are co-transfected with the expression plasmid required for replication and transcription of the NDV viral genome (NP, P, and L) 8-10 chicken embryonated eggs are candled to mark the interface between the air sac and the allantoic cavity. with an insulin (1 ml) syringe, eggs are infected with the tissue culture supernatant inside the allantoic cavity. the full recombinant genome follows the \"rule of six\" as for the rescue process, quality of plasmid preparations, the MVA-T7 stocks as well as proper maintenance of cells are critical. in most cases, standard maxiprep purification of the plasmid DNA is enough. the rescue of recombinant NDV from cDNA is an useful technique for multiple reasons. the technique provides the ability to analyze the biology of the newly rescued virus by experimentally altering its genes and regulatory sequences. recombinant NDV is a paramyxovirus closely related to human pathogens like measles, mumps or respiratory syncytial viruses."}
