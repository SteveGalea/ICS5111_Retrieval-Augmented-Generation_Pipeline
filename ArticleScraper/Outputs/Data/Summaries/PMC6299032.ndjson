{"summary": "in healthy children, they usually cause upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) with a benign, self-limited course (Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010; Meissner, 2016; Kou et al., 2016). however, immunocompromised hosts are particularly vulnerable to severe infections. these RNA viruses are among the most common causes of respiratory infection in immunocompromised patients. the annual activity of these viruses is variable, but distinct patterns have been described. they cause seasonal outbreaks, and most are predominantly seen during the winter. clinical presentation can range from asymptomatic viral shedding to severe respiratory distress. myelosuppression and HCT bearing the highest morbidity and mortality. mortality associated with respiratory viruses in children undergoing HCT varies. a focus of interest has been to determine and assess risk factors for progression to LRTI. age, lymphopenia, high-dose total body irradiation and presence of co-pathogens are significant risk factors for progression to LRTI. clinical scores have been developed for adults undergoing HCT. larger, multiplexed panels can be advantageous in an immunocompromised population. symptoms can be atypical, making it difficult to predict the most likely agents of infection with any degree of clinical certainty. such highly sensitive tests raise numerous questions, however. fluorescence Moderate-high 1\u20132 h Rapid, multianalyte detection. amenable to point-of-care testing Nucleic acid amplification tests High 15 min8 h New reference standard. both phenotypic and genotypic assays have developed. but genotypic methods are most commonly used for routine testing to detect neuraminidase inhibitor resistance of influenza viruses in clinical specimens. hand hygiene, screening visitors for respiratory symptoms, education of healthcare personal to avoid caring for patients if they are sick are among the most widely strategies implemented across institutions. we stop isolation in patients with infections due to rhinovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, or unidentified etiology after 48 h of resolution of symptoms with no retesting needed. patients with respiratory infection due to RSV, influenza, HMPV, or HPIV require both resolution of symptoms and a negative test to be taken off isolation. Virus Antiviral Drug class Dose/Duration Side effects Resistance Respiratory syncytial virus Ribavirin Nucleoside analog Children/Adults: Inhaled Oral 2 grams over 2 h TID Loading dose of 600 mg 200 mg TID on day 1 400 mg TID on day 2 Then maximum 30/mg/kg/day Bronchospasm Hemolysis, liver and renal toxicity None reported Influenza virus. 100 mg PO twice daily 5 mg/kg/day PO in 2 doses 5 mg/kg/day PO in 2 doses 5 mg/kg/day PO in 2 doses Cardiac, neurologic and gastrointestinal events; neutropenia High prevalence of resistance in all Influenza A (H3N2) and (H1N1) pdm09 Not active against influenza A strains. mechanism of action Route of administration Company Respiratory syncytial virus ALS-8176 (a.k.a Lumicitabine) Nucleoside analog Orally Alios BioPharma RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) GS-5806 (a.k.a Presatovir) Fusion inhibitor* Orally Gilead VP-14637 (aka MDT-637) Fusion inhibitor* Orally Vaxart AK-0529 Fusion idesInhibits the maturation of influenza virus HA Orally Romark Laboratories MEDI8852 Monoclonal antibody Intravenous AstraZeneca VIS410 Monoclonal antibody Intravenous Visterra Parainfluenza virus DAS181 (a.k.a.Paradase) Targets the Viral Receptor (Sialic Acid) Inhaled Ansun BioPharma Human Metapneumovirus MAb 338 RSV is a single stranded, negative-sense RNA virus within the family Paramyxoviridae. its genome transcribes to produce 11 proteins: NS1, NS2, N, P, M, SH, G, F, M2-1, M2-2, and L. in a single center study, Hakim and colleagues determined the epidemiology of respiratory viruses on children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. they reported that RSV was the second most common respiratory infection in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia can be up to 2.2%. risk factors included in an index developed by investigators at university of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to categorize patients into prognostic risk groups. this was present in one third of the patients after development of LRTI. viremia was independently associated with mortality. a droplet digital PCR assay was performed with 73 samples from 19 patients with RSV infection. patients who presented with either cough or nasal congestion had significantly higher viral load when compared to those that only presented with one symptom. ribavirin is a nucleoside analog that resembles guanosine. ribavirin alone or in combination with immunomodulatory therapy improved mortality rates when compared to no therapy in adult HCT recipients. a 5-day and 10-day treatment course would cost $149,765 and $299,530 respectively. some authors suggest that the oral formulation is not effective given low achievable plasma concentrations. animal models and initial studies showed benefits of ribavirin plus RSV hyperimmunoglobulin compared to ribavirin alone. uncontrolled studies suggested use of combination therapy with ribavirin and IVIG improved survival. palivizumab has been proven effective in reducing severe RSV infection in premature infants and children with chronic lung disease (AAP, 2014a,b) palivizumab is administered in 5 monthly doses (November-March) to all patients with AML, SCID, or HCT recipients. influenza infection remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients. the incidence in HCT recipients ranges from 1 to 3%. influenza infection remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. influenza was the most common virus associated with hospital admission. all patients admitted to the ICU had bacterial co-infection. the latter ranges from 6 to 28%. intravenous zanamivir is available for compassionate use only. peramivir is the only NAI approved for IV use. the efficacy and safety of peramivir needs further assessment. endonuclease inhibitors are a new class of antiviral drugs. phase III development of baloxavir marboxil is underway in the USA, EU and other countries. Xofluza was approved in Japan on February 2018. vaccinated patients 6 months of age or older should be vaccinated as soon as possible with the seasonal influenza vaccine. high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine elicited a more robust immune response in children with cancer when compared to standard-dose vaccine. in this cohort RVI was associated with an all-cause case fatality rate of 11 and 8% of patients with HPIV infection died. most of the patients presented with URTI and 20% progressed to LRTI with a median of 4 days from onset of symptoms. use of IVIG has not impacted clinical outcomes, including progression to LRTI and mortality. PIV infection has been linked to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) MPV incidence in immunocompromised hosts has been reported to be as high as 40%. incidence in those with hematological malignancies did not differ compared to HCT recipients. there is currently no approved antiviral therapy for HMPV. some studies showed no benefits from antiviral therapy with ribavirin. 13 percent of patients with RhV infection had no respiratory symptoms at the time of diagnosis. the remaining patients had URT symptoms. four patients underwent a BAL for concerns of progression to LRTI. the cumulative incidence estimated at day 100 was 11.1%. seasonal outbreaks were common in the winter with 13 of 22 cases first detected in December through March. pulmonary disorder, and detection of a respiratory co-pathogen, particularly RSV, were associated with an increased likelihood of LRTD or severe LRTD. there is currently no treatment available for coronaviruses. current in vitro evaluation of HCoV therapy includes investigation of antiviral, as well as human monoclonal antibodies. -5806 resulted in a reduction of mucus weight, symptom score and viral load. targeting the nucleoprotein has gained interest given that is highly conserved. RNA interference is a process in which small interfering RNAs decrease protein production by degrading specific mRNA. influenza fludase (DAS181, Ansun BioPharma), a novel sialidase fusion protein, has shown in vitro activity toward all influenza strains isolated to date. a phase II clinical trial on healthy volunteers showed safety, tolerability, and effectivity in reducing viral load in the groups receiving DAS181 compared to placebo. nitazoxanide (NT-300; Romark Laboratories, Florida, USA), an antiparasitic agent, has shown broad activity toward influenza A including A(pH1N1) and H7N9, as well as influenza B and strains resistant to oseltamivir. phase 2b/3 clinical trial comparing nitazoxanide vs. placebo showed reduction of clinical symptoms and viral shedding in patients with uncomplicated influenza infection. fda granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to DAS181. phase 3 trials are currently being planned. two mAbs, MAb 338 and human Fab DS7, have prophylactic and therapeutic potential. there are two main limitations to immunotherapy strategies for respiratory viruses. one is that, with the exception of influenza, knowledge of viral immunology is less complete than for CMV and EBV. the same group generated HMPV specific T cells for adoptive transfer in patients after allogeneic HCT (Tzannou et al., 2017). fusion inhibitors are directed at glycoprotein F with the goal of blocking viral entry into cells lining the respiratory tract. GS-5806 (a.k.a. Presatovir; Gilead Sciences) is an oral RSV entry inhibitor and functions as an allosteric blocker of the F protein preventing RSV entry. MEDI8897 (MedImmune) is a recombinant human mAb with a modified Fc region that extends more than 3-fold its half-life to 85\u2013117 days after one single dose. ALX-0171 (Ablynx) is an inhaled trimeric nanobody that binds the antigenic site II of the F protein and neutralizes RSV A and B. two phase 3 studies on adults with uncomplicated influenza have been completed. nitazoxanide (NT-300; Romark Laboratories, Florida, USA), an antiparasitic agent, has shown broad activity toward influenza A including A(pH1N1) and H7N9, as well as influenza B and strains resistant to oseltamivir. ansun Biopharma has completed a multi-site phase II study comparing DAS181 with placebo in immunocompromised patients with parainfluenza LRTI requiring oxygen. in 2017 the fda has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to DAS181. vapendavir has reduced clinical symptoms in asthmatic adults. there are several steps in coronavirus life cycle where antiviral agents could be implemented. there are two main limitations to immunotherapy strategies for respiratory viruses. hematological malignancies and HCT recipients bear most of the burden of these viruses. age, baseline diagnosis, use of steroids, lymphopenia, and early onset after transplant are shared risk factors for LRTI and mortality. however, management of these infections remains challenging. the remaining authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
