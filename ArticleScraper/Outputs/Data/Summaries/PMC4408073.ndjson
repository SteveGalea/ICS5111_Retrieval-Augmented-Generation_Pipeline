{"summary": "anecdotal and firm conclusions cannot be made until formal clinical trials are done, such as those encouraged by the world health organization [4]. this diversity of function makes it possible to tailor Ab therapies to specific diseases depending on what might be needed for protection. antibodies overcome the anti-phagocytic properties of encapsulated microbes by promoting phagocytosis through Fc receptors. the versatility associated with Ab therapies is amplified by the availability of different isotypes that differ in serum half-life and effector function. the latter partially dependent on Fc receptors (FcR) that can amplify or reduce inflammatory responses. the efficacy of broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV is dependent on FcRs. antibodies target a single species and, often, a single serotype or variant within a species. this is a double-edged sword for the development of Ab therapies. the high specificity of Ab-based therapies offers a tremendous advantage. ab therapies work best when given in a prophylactic mode (e.g., before infection) or early in the course of disease. antimicrobial agents are often effective in established infection and disease. an alternative explanation for this limitation is that Abs work best in neutralizing the infective inoculum. there are at least three mechanisms of antibody function that could benefit patients with Ebola. anecdotal reports suggest that control of Ebola-virus-induced cytokine storm might be beneficial therapeutically. the use of ab therapies in the field of infectious diseases remains a work in progress. mAb cocktails are being developed against Ebola virus, C. difficile colitis, and for the prevention of rabies. this law of pharmaceutical economics has favored the development of broad-spectrum therapies that are responsible for widespread resistance and deleterious effects of Ab therapies on host microbiota. an increasing recognition of the problems associated with broad-spectrum therapy combined with declining efficacy of such drugs due to widespread resistance is leading to the development and use of rapid diagnostic tools. the ongoing Ebola epidemic provides a special lens for understanding the promise and roadblocks to the development of Ab-based therapies for infectious diseases. widespread use of broad-spectrum therapy has been associated with an increase in C. difficile colitis creating an opportunity for the development of toxin-neutralizing Ab therapy [22] for the far horizon, we are optimistic that ab-based therapies will be widely reintroduced as anti-infective agents."}
