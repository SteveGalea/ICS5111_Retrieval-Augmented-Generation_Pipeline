{"summary": "etiological agent cannot be identified in many cases despite the use of a wide range of sensitive diagnostic assays. this can depend on the timing of sampling, performance of the individual assays, and also the involvement of divergent viruses. new perspectives for research and diagnostic applications of virus detection have opened up with recent advances in sequence-independent amplification techniques combined with next-generation sequencing platforms. a sequence-independent next-generation sequencing approach is a relatively efficient tool for the simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses. out of 261 patients screened by standard diagnostic assays in Thailand for influenza A and B viruses (13) and (nested) in-house RT-PCR assays for human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus (15, 16), human adenovirus (hAdV), human metapneumovirus (h 66.7% were infants (n = 54), 25.9% were in preschool (n = 21), 3.7% were in primary school (n = 3), and 3.7% were in secondary school (n = 3) the clinical severity of each disease case was defined as mild (a pediatric patient with acute respiratory tract infection [ARTI] complications without abnormal breath sounds and who did not require intubation) PCR products were purified using the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) (20, 21) 12 samples were pooled for each library preparation. a library of DNA fragments was prepared using a GS FLX Titanium rapid library MID adaptor kit (454 Life Sciences); a library of DNA fragments was prepared using a GS FLX Titanium library preparation kit (454 Life Sciences). sequences without hits in the host BLAST were then subjected to a BLASTX search against sequences present in the GenBank nr database. sensitivity of a deep-sequencing approach for detecting viruses is dependent on sequencing depth. phylogenetic trees were prepared with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using p-distance (HRV and HBoV) and maximum-likelihood composite models (EV and hMPV) as described previously. out of 261 patients screened by standard diagnostic assays in Thailand for influenza A and B viruses. the age distribution of the enrolled patients was between 8 days and 14 years. of the 81 patients, 66.7% were infants (n = 54), 25.9% were in preschool (n = 21), 3.7% were in primary school (n = 3), and 3.7% were in secondary school (n = 3) ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University (IRB 493/2557) nasopharyngeal aspirates were centrifuged and filtered through a 0.45-m-pore filter. samples were treated with OmniCleave endonuclease (Epicentre; Illumina) RNA and DNA were extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA XS kit (Macherey-Nagel) and the High Pure viral nucleic acids kit (Roche) the resulting contigs and singletons were filtered with dustMasker. the remaining taxonomic units were subjected to a BLASTN search. BLAST hits were categorized by assigning taxonomic categories. total nucleic acid was extracted from an aliquot (200 l) of the 81 nasopharyngeal aspirates using the MagNA Pure LC total nucleic acid isolation kit and the MagNA Pure LC isolation station (Roche) the samples were screened for the presence of human rhinovirus, enterovirus, and human metapneumovirus by a real-time RT-PCR. the taxonomic content of the different samples varied substantially (Fig. 1A) and showed no strong correlation with patient age or disease severity. the moderate and severe disease cases seemed to have higher mean viral contents in the metagenome than did mild disease cases, in contrast to the bacterial contents. anellovirus 46 3 (37.5) 29 (59.2) 14 (60.1) Rhinovirus 28 3 (37.5) 21 (42.9) 4 (17.4) Bocavirus 16 1 (12.5) 11 (22.4) 4 (17.4) Enterovirus 13 0 13 (26.5) 0 Respiratory syncytial virus 11 1 (12.5) 9 (18.4) 1 (4.3) Herpesvirus 10 0 7 (14.3) 3 (13) Adenovirus 7 0 3 (6.1) 4 (17.4) the sequencing approach may be less sensitive than real-time RT-PCRs for enterovirus and bocavirus detection. however, the sequencing approach may be less sensitive than real-time RT-PCRs for enterovirus and bocavirus detection. 30.38h 32.65h CU127 25,231 0.020g 0.067 29.44 3.028 26.44 CU132 34,116 0.015g CU134 11,504 0.635 24.59 13.543 24.33 CU136 12,848 30.57g CU149 3,880 0.026h CU151 5,060 7.016 25.18 CU153 5,382 4.236g CU157 3,490 0.057 18.70 CU g Samples positive only by deep sequencing. h Samples positive only by real-time PCR. the percentages of viral reads of the total number of analyzed reads are displayed against the real-time RT-PCR CT values for rhinovirus (A), human metapneumovirus (B), enterovirus (C), and bocavirus (D) detection limit was 0.01% (range, 0.22% to 0.003%) viral reads in the metagenome. a subset of samples was detected by only one of the two assays. the next-generation sequencing approach was negative in a small number of samples. rhinovirus, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, and bocavirus genomes were obtained from 11 different patients. the genomes showed the highest nucleotide identity to enterovirus 68 strains from Japan and new Zealand. a phylogenetic tree of the near-complete rhinovirus genomes from patients CU41, CU42, CU106, CB14, and CB19 was generated using MEGA6 with the neighbor-joining method with the maximum-likelihood composite parameter. a phylogenetic tree of the near-complete hMPV genome from patients CU70, CU134, and CU171 and representative human metapneumoviruses was generated using ME random amplification combined with next-generation sequencing would be advantageous in clinical viral diagnostics. it eliminates the need for the design and validation of several tens or hundreds of specific primers/probes targeting multiple viral pathogens. instead, it allows the characterization of hundreds of different known pathogens simultaneously without a priori knowledge of the virus present and provides in-depth virus species/type information. the detection of RNA viruses with the sequencing approach was generally better than for DNA viruses. the removal of host DNA was more substantial in the RNA isolation than in the DNA isolation procedure. increasing sequencing depth using other next-generation sequencing platforms with increased sequence output may increase the sensitivity of the next-generation sequencing approach even further. all the hMPV strains were typed as A, the human bocaviruses were type I, and RSV (64% type A, 27% type B) and human herpesvirus (HHV) infections were typed as well. the next-generation sequencing approach identified a number of viruses that are usually not screened for in respiratory infections using routine diagnostic assays. the incidence of human anelloviruses in vitreous fluid of patients with seasonal hyperacute panuveitis was significantly higher than that in non-SHAPU patients. the data suggested that anelloviruses observed in vitreous fluid samples of patients with uveitis, but not in non-SHAPU patients. inflammation in the respiratory tract system, caused by an infection, may cause increased permeability of the capillary barrier, resulting in edema. next-generation sequencing assay may actually reach that of current diagnostic routine real-time RT-PCR assays. a sequence-independent sequencing assay may be applied to samples that remain negative with routine diagnostics."}
