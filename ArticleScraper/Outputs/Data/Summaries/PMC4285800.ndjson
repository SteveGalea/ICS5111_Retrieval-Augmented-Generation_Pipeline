{"summary": "metagenomics is the term coined for the research that focuses on many genomes at the same time, as typical in some sections of environmental studies. the term is coined for the research that focuses on many genomes at the same time, as typical in some sections of environmental studies. viruses have been shown to play a major role in the functioning of microbial communities by processes such as viral infection and selective killing of certain taxa or as vectors for horizontal gene transfer. the discovery and classification of novel viral species, but also of higher order taxa, is therefore of particular interest in this context. first-level assignment of sequence data coming from a non-targeted sequencing of a metagenomic sample is a particularly challenging computational problem. the most blatant difficulty is in the recognition of novel viral sequences, for which no close homologs have been previously characterized. novel solutions have been suggested to overcome these limitations. these methods are based on long k-mers (words of size k) and conceptually rely on the fact that when k is sufficiently large, k-mers become very specific. the downside of these approaches is over-specificity, which makes classification of unknown sequences problematic. recent results show that contig-level assembly improves the strength of the taxonomic signal contained in individual short reads. this is especially salient for viral sequences, as the vast majority fail to be uniquely assigned to any domain of life. the problem of fine-grained classification for bacterial and viral communities has seen great progress in recent years. known marker genes' taxonomic classification is available through reference taxonomies such as RDP (Cole et al., 2009) or Greengenes (McDonald et al., 2012). this type of analysis has one major pitfall: it does not provide a reliable method to quantify the identified species. filtering avoids contamination by bacterial, archaeal or eukaryotic cells. such filtering-based purification also excludes the largest viruses. both LA and MDA amplifications have their downfalls. classification tasks are fine-grained assignment problems and mimic characterization of targeted metagenomic studies. task (3) represents a first-level assignment and mimics the analysis of complex, untargeted environmental samples. the performance of a classifier is dependent on the learning algorithm (e.g., SVM or Nave Bayes) and on the training data. k-Disagreeing Neighbors measures for a given instance the number of k nearest neighbors that do not share its class label. k-disagreeing Neighbors measures for a given instance the number of k nearest neighbors that do not share its class label. for task (1), only bacterial genomes were considered, for task (2) only viral genomes were considered. median kDN is significantly extreme (low value indicating easy classification, high value corresponding to difficult classes) for the first-level classification task, archaeal and bacterial contigs can be easily assigned to their respective domain. fine-grained classification to groups is hard, while assigning a viral sequence to a family level is easier, though less easy. more than 6000 different archaeal contigs (red bar) not having a single non-archeal contigs in their closest 73 neighbors (red bar corresponding to 0 kDN) only the top 4 most abundant classes are shown for (B1,C1) and 6 for (B2,C2). cellular contigs are spread uniformly in these 2 dimensions, with exception of plants viruses that are more compact. bacterial viruses are not close to their hosts; plant viruses are closer to archaea than to their hosts. the difficulty for viral sequence classification will be alleviated as the public sequence databases become further populated with acquired viral data. this will not provide a sufficient solution to the problem of novel species discovery."}
