{"summary": "retroviruses include many pathogenic agents in humans and animals. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) induce acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), respectively. the retroviral entry mechanism is proposed as follows. the TM protein is thought to have hairpin-like structure. the fusion pore is formed to derive the viral core into host cell cytoplasm. polytropic MLVs cannot infect amphotropic virus-infected cells. Xenotropic MLVs recognize the XPR1 as polytropic MLVs. these MLV infection receptors are multimembrane spanning proteins. v Protein Inhibits Membrane Fusion When retrovirus-producing and -susceptible cells are mixed, viral Env proteins on the cells can effectively interact with infection receptors on the neighboring susceptible cells via direct cell-to-cell contact. interactions can lead to cell-to-cell infection that allows very rapid and synchronized replication of virus compared to the cell-free infection. the R peptide controls the three-dimensional structure of the SU protein [38] and a disulfide bond between the SU and TM proteins. it has been reported that the R peptide of TM subunit regulates the receptor-mediated SU conformational changes through the S\u2013S bond between the TM and SU. retrovirus entry inhibits ecotropic, amphotropic, polytropic, and xenotropic MLV infections. the more specific inhibitors of endosome acidification suppress all of ecotropic, amphotropic, polytropic, and xenotropic MLV infections. psin B protease Dynamin DN mutant1 Dynamin-dependent endocytosis Caveolin-dependent endocytosis Eps 15 DN mutant Endocytosis 1DN: dominant negative. Table 2. Differential dependence of HIV and MLV infections on endosome acidification. earlier reports show that ammonium chloride and bafilomycin do not affect ALV infection. receptor binding of ALV induces the Env protein to convert to its prehairpin intermediate at neutral pH [59, 60], then endosome acidification triggers the formation of the final fusion-active form of the Env protein [61\u201363]. it has been proposed that the discrepancy came from unusual stability of the Env prehairpin intermediate. debris internalized by phagocytosis is degraded in the acidic phagosomes (phagolysosomes) debris internalized by phagocytosis is degraded in the acidic phagosomes (phagolysosomes) early endosomes to recycling endosomes (pH 6.4) and are reused on the plasma membrane. some proteins are also recycled from late endosomes/lysosomes through the trans-Golgi network. s can fuse with lysosomes (pH 5.0-6.0) or recycle back to the cell surface. trafficking of macropinosomes depends on cell type and mode of macropinocytosis induction. many receptors are segregated from their ligands in early endosomes due to weakly acidic condition (pH 6.0) internalization of retroviral Particles into Intracellular Vesicles. dynamin-dominant negative mutant suppresses amphotropic MLV infection. dynamin-dominant negative mutant does not inhibit ecotropic MLV infection in human HeLa cells expressing ecotropic receptor. mouse NIH3T3, human TE671, rat XC [52] Xenotropic MLV Dynamin dependent Mouse NIH3T3, human TE671, rat XC [52] Xenotropic MLV Dynamin dependent Mouse NIH3T3, human TE671, rat XC [52] CD4-independent HIV Dynamin dependent Human HeLa [98] Dynamin-, Eps15 independent Human 293T, HeLa, TE the acidification inhibitors suppress the degradation in late endosomes/lysosomes. the acidification inhibitors suppress the degradation in late endosomes. the acidification inhibitors suppress the degradation in late endosomes. ecotropic and amphotropic MLV particles are internalized into endosomes. cathepsin proteases are activated in the acidic late endosomes. xenotropic MLV infection requires endosome acidification and cathepsin proteases. a low-pH pulse of JSRV particles overcomes the bafilomycin-mediated infection inhibition [69], EIAV infectivity is enhanced by low-pH treatment [67], and cell-cell fusion induced by the ALV Env protein is enhanced at low pH [55]. analysis of the pH dependence of the foamy virus Env-mediated fusion in a cell-cell fusion assay revealed an induction of syncytium formation by a short exposure to acidic pH dynasore and siRNA-mediated knockdown of dynamin expression suppress ecotropic MLV infection in XC cells. acidification inhibitors do not suppress cathepsin activation in XC cells. dynasore and siRNA-mediated knockdown of dynamin expression suppress ecotropic MLV infection in XC cells. the mechanism of acidification-independent cathepsin activation in XC cells is waiting to be resolved. the mechanism of acidification-independent cathepsin activation in XC cells is waiting to be resolved. protein of a CD4-independent HIV efficiently induces pH-independent syncytium formation [87] but infection by CD4-independent HIV occurs through acidic endosomes. a cell adhesion molecule, LFA-1, facilitates HIV-mediated syncytium formation but not HIV infection. vanishing of fluorescent signals was observed in intracellular vesicles. endosome acidification inhibitors attenuate infections by CD4-independent HIVs. infection of trophoblasts forming placental barrier may cause transmission of HIV. entry pathway of CD4-dependent HIV is considered as follows. a cathepsin inhibitor CA-074Me more significantly enhances CD4-independent HIV infection than CD4-dependent. ecotropic MLVs use endocytosis, acidification, and digestion by endosome proteases to enter into the host cell cytoplasm. by the ecotropic virus entry mechanism, the viruses can escape from these host immune reactions. it is suggested that the CD4-dependent HIV entry utilizes endocytosis, but not acidification and proteolysis. cathepsin-mediated digestion of CD4-dependent HIV Env protein may induce membrane fusion without CD4 binding. redirected infection may occur through endosomes and require endosome acidification. retroviral vectors containing modified Env proteins suffer from very low transduction efficiency or are not infectious. retrovirus vectors enter into host cells by the entry mechanisms of heterologous viral glycoproteins. pseudotyped retrovirus vectors are widely used to identify entry pathways of various enveloped viruses. a dominant negative mutant of Eps15 suppress infection by an HIV vector pseudotyped with Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) clathrin-dependent endocytosis is partially inhibited by inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. the entry route of Ebola virus is not clear yet. pathways of retrovirus internalization into intracellular vesicles may be unimportant. retrovirus particles are internalized into intracellular vesicles by various pathways. vesicle acidification is necessary for the infections."}
