{"summary": "the complement system has been implicated in the development of acute lung diseases induced by highly pathogenic viruses including influenza A virus H1N1,4 H5N1,5 H7N9,6 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov),7 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov) there were more than five highly pathogenic viruses such as SARS coronavirus in 2002, avian influenza A/H5N1 virus in 1997, H1N1 virus in 2009, H7N9 virus in 2013, and MERS coronavirus in 2012. this is the primary cause of an outbreak by jumping directly from bird to human. the novel influenza A virus pandemic poses a serious threat to public health. pathogenic virus infections have different epidemiology, there is a similar rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients infected with H5N1 develop rapidly progressive pneumonia, further resulting in ALI or ARDS. 1N1 virus in 2009, H7N9 virus in 2013, and MERS coronavirus in 2012. this is the primary cause of an outbreak by jumping directly from bird to human. this is the primary cause of an outbreak by jumping directly from bird to human. avian influenza A H7N9 virus in 2013 also caused severe pneumonia. postmortem biopsy of 3 patients infected with H7N9 showed acute diffuse alveolar damage. patients 2 and 3, who died 11 days after symptom onset, had pulmonary fibro proliferative changes. avian influenza hemagglutinins typically bind alpha 2-3 sialic acid receptors. human influenza hemagglutinins bind alpha 2-6 sialic acid receptors. complement activation plays a critical role in pathogenesis of virus-induced acute lung injury. chemoattractants C5a and interleukin 8 (IL-8) can be synthesized by cells in the lung. IL-8 levels have also been found to correlate with neutrophil numbers and the degree of lung dysfunction. excess of NETs contributes to pathology of a number of diseases including those of the lung. NETs are found in infection-related ALI models of influenza virus. in vitro studies demonstrated that C5a is able to induce the release of NETs. reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) play a critical role in oxidative burst. anti-C5a blocked the oxidative burst in whole blood induced with E. coli. the virus used NS1 histone mimic to suppress human RNA polymerase-associated factor 1 transcription elongation complex-mediated antiviral response. diverssely modified histone regulates gene replication, repair and transcription. adhesion molecules.61 C5a directly activates endothelial cells to upregulate adhesion molecules such as P-selectin. adhesion molecules on the surface of inflammatory cells also have an important role in inflammatory cell migration. these data show that C5a indirectly induces adaptive immune response by activating innate immune cells. human DCs67,68 and T cells69 express the C5a receptor (C5aR, CD88) thus, C5a is also a potent chemoattractant for human T cells. many cytokines, triggered by highly pathogenic viruses like H5N1, has been called a cytokine storm. a cytokine could induce other cytokines to further enhance the pro-inflammatory response. anti-TNF- (etanercept) significantly reduced the damage of ALI. blockade of cytokine storm is effective in treatment of infections with highly pathogenic virus. many inflammatory and anti-viral genes were differentially expressed in SARS patients. many pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-, and IL-8 significantly increased. a number of IFN-stimulated genes like double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase decreased in the acute severe case. chemoattractants C5a and interleukin 8 (IL-8) can be synthesized by cells in the lung. IL-8 levels have also been found to correlate with neutrophil numbers and the degree of lung dysfunction. NET increases the permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier by cleaving endothelial actin cytoskeleton, E-cadherin and VE-cadherin. the excess of NET components are potent factors in lung injury. anti-C5a blocked the oxidative burst in whole blood induced with Neisseria meningitides. p47phox phosphorylation is essential for assembly of NADPH oxidase. oxidant production may also be involved in signal transduction pathways. histone can be excreted into cells to reduce intracellular histone to suppress antiviral gene expression. neutrophil extracellular histones-contained extracellular traps (NETs) develop when polymorphonuclear leukocytes are incubated with C5a. in vitro studies demonstrated upregulation of CD1lb/CD18 expression on neutrophils induced by C5a. adhesion molecules effectively enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- production by pulmonary macrophages. CD28 and CD40L on T cells are important signaling for T-cell proliferation and differentiation. the binding of the C5a to the C5aR also plays an important role in CD8+ T cell responses. the binding of the C5a to the C5aR is critical to CD4+ T cell proliferation and differentiation. many cytokines, triggered by highly pathogenic viruses like H5N1, have been called a cytokine storm. the pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1 and TNF- might contribute to the severity of disease. antiviral agent Arbidol hydrochloride effectively inhibits both H1N1 strains and diminishes both viral replication and acute inflammation. blockade of cytokine storm is effective in treatment of infections with highly pathogenic virus. kinase, interferon-induced guanylate-binding protein-1 and 2, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 decreased in the acute severe case. kinase, interferon-induced guanylate-binding protein-1 and 2, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 decreased in the acute severe case. antagonism of C5a receptors also significantly inhibited the development of ARDS induced by intravenous infusion of cobra venom factor. the study indicates that C5a signaling greatly contributes to inflammation and injury in the lung and was targeted to treat highly pathogenic virus infection. anti-C5a treatment in H7N9-infected monkeys substantially attenuated ALI by reducing the lung infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. it is reasonable to speculate that the neutralized humanized anti-human C5a antibody would be a potential therapeutic option for H5N1-infected patients. anti-C5a treatment in monkeys significantly attenuated ALI. it markedly reduced lung histopathological injury and decreased lung infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. blockade of a humanized anti-human C5a antibody would be a potential therapeutic target for highly pathogenic viral infection-induced acute lung injury."}
