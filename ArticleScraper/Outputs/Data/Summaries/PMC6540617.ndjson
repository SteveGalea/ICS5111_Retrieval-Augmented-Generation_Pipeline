{"summary": "emodin was down-regulated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology or guggulsterones. the BSEP upstream molecule farnesoid X receptor was up-regulated by lentivirus or GW4064. emodin could increase the mRNA and protein expression of BSEP and FXR. cholestasis is characterized by disorders of bile formation, bile acid (BA) detoxification and its transport obstacles that are caused by the impairment of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. the cause of cholestasis is the bile secretion disorders of hepatocyte or bile duct epithelial cells and bile flow blockage. emodin is extracted from the traditional Chinese herb rhubarb as its main active ingredient. it has been confirmed that emodin has liver protection. emodin could alleviate the role of liver injury in cholestatic hepatitis caused by concanavalin A and alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) emodin could alleviate intrahepatic cholestasis by promoting the expression of liver farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP), uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 2 family polypeptide B4 (UGT2B4) and bile salt export pump (BSEP) the molecular mechanism and target gene on alleviating intrahepatic cholestasis.

BSEP can pump univalent BAs into the bile duct and ultimately into the gallbladder. some reports showed that Fxr-knockout mice had excessive levels of BAs, cholesterol and triglycerides. the FXR antagonist guggulsterones has been proven to exacerbate cholestasis in liver cells. we chose guggulsterones/siRNA and GW4064/lentivirus to down-regulate FXR. the LO2 cell experiment, the mRNA and protein expressions of FXR and BSEP were significantly elevated in the emodin group compared with control group. the mRNA and protein expressions of FXR and BSEP were also significantly elevated in the emodin groups. emodin could also increase the level of FXR and BSEP, no matter of the basic level of FXR low or high. the emodin pathway was activated in ANIT-induced cholestasis rats. after treatment, the liver pathological changes and the serum TBIL, DBIL, TBA, ALP, GGT, ALT, and AST were monitored. by emodin intervention, it could be observed improvement of the hepatic impairment was achieved.
