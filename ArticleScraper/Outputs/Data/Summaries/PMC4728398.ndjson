{"summary": "three-week-old wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 (abbreviated to B6) mice and three-week-old ACE2 knockout mice (B6 background) were housed in the animal facility at Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology. all experiments involving human subjects were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology. mice were anesthetized with 20 l 1% (w/v) pentobarbital sodium and then inoculated intranasally (IN) with 2 106.5 PFU of BJ016 or 20 l 1X PBS (mock-infection) for all mice, body weight was recorded daily before and after viral infection. lin and eosin staining, the lungs from each mouse were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut into 4-m sections, and stained with H&E. the number of inflammatory cells was counted, and data were presented as the number of cells per 200 field. severity of pulmonary edema was measured using the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio. plasma samples were analyzed in triplicate. a value of p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. all experiments were performed in triplicate at least. purified viruses were re-suspended in 1X PBS and stored at 70 \u00b0C. for RSV-induced lung injury, 3-week-old mice were anesthetized with 20 l 1% (w/v) pentobarbital sodium. for all mice, body weight was recorded daily before and after viral infection. Western blotting Lung tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer. antibodies for Western blotting were used: rat polyclonal anti-ACE2 antibodies and rabbit monoclonal anti-ACE antibodies (all R&D Systems) hep-2 cells were cultured for 7 days at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. cells were stained with crystal violet, and viral plaques were counted. subjects provided informed consent for participation in this study. plasma levels of Ang II were higher in the early-stage (up until 8 days from onset) than in the late-stage (after 10 days from onset) plasma levels of Ang II decreased rapidly from the infection to the recovery phase of RSV infection. ACE2 protein levels were dramatically decreased in mice infected with Ang II. ACE2 deficiency increases the severity of RSV-induced lung injury. ACE2 knockout (ACE2 KO) or wild-type (WT) mice survived. lung histopathology scores were significantly reduced in ACE2 KO mice compared with WT mice (p 0.01; Fig. 2d), indicating a more severe lung injury phenotype. viral titers in lung tissue of RSV-infected ACE2 KO mice were significantly higher by approximately five-fold. loss of ACE2 increases severity of RSV BJ016 virus-induced lung injury. survival rates of WT and ACE2 knockout (KO) mice (n = 10 per group) leukocyte cell counts were significantly decreased in hACE2-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. hACE2-treated mice infected with RSV A2 showed mild pathological lung alterations. plasma levels of Ang II were significantly decreased by nearly 30%. the Ang II receptor AT1R affects the severity of RSV-induced lung injury because Ang II receptors mediate the action of Ang II. all experiments were performed in triplicate at least. 2R inhibitor had no significant effects on the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio (Figure S4a) or viral titers (Figure S4b), suggesting a lack of efficacy of this inhibitor in rescuing the lung injury induced by BJ016 virus-infected WT mice. both Ang II and AT1R play critical roles in regulating RSV-induced ALI in preclinical models. ACE2 KO mice were treated with AT1R (15 mg/kg)10 at 1 day before infection. at 5 DPI, AT1R-treated ACE2 KO mice showed mild inflammatory changes. at 5 DPI, severe histopathological damage was observed in vehicle-treated ACE2 KO mice. ACE2 knockout mice treated with PBS control or AT1R inhibitor at 5 DPI. plasma levels of Ang II were significantly elevated in RSV-infected patients. plasma levels of Ang II decreased rapidly from the infection to the recovery phase of RSV infection. angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 plays a critical role in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced lung injury. ACE2 protein levels in lung homogenates were moderately elevated in mice infected with RSV BJ016 or A2 virus relative to mock infection. ACE2 protein levels were dramatically decreased in lung homogenates from mice infected with RSV or mock virus at 3 days post-infection. ACE2 deficiency increases severity of RSV-induced lung injury. the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio was significantly higher in ACE2 KO mice compared with WT mice. ACE2 KO mice were significantly higher by approximately five-fold relative to those of RSV-infected WT mice. plasma levels of Ang II were significantly elevated in ACE2 KO mice compared with WT mice. hACE2-treated mice showed only mild inflammatory reactions. leukocyte cell counts were significantly decreased in hACE2-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. hACE2-treated mice significantly reduced (p 0.01; Fig. 3c), indicating lung edema mediated by recombinant hACE2 proteins. plasma levels of Ang II were significantly decreased by nearly 30%. hACE2-treated mice infected with RSV A2 exhibited mild pathological lung alterations. all experiments were performed in triplicate at least. the Ang II receptor AT1R affects the severity of RSV-induced lung injury. Ang II receptor angiotensin II type 1 receptor regulates RSV BJ016 virus-induced lung injury. both Ang II and AT1R play critical roles in regulating RSV-induced ALI in preclinical models. at 5 DPI, leukocyte cell counts were reduced by 10% in ACE2 KO mice treated with AT1R. lung wet-to-dry weight ratio decreased by 86% in AT1R-treated ACE2 KO mice compared with vehicle-treated ACE2 KO mice. ACE2 may play a crucial role in the process of RSV viral infection. ACE2 KO mice treated with PBS control or AT1R inhibitor at 5 DPI. c) Lung viral titers in ACE2 KO mice treated with PBS control or AT1R inhibitor at 5 DPI. ACE2 is an essential receptor for SARS infection in vitro and in vivo11,28. it protects individuals from developing severe acute lung failure11. ACE2 is non-functional during lung injury processes induced by various influenza virus subtypes such as H1N1 and H3N2. there are associations between influenza virus infection and ACE2 levels, even with different influenza strains. ACE2 deficiency aggravates RSV-induced ALI and that administration of a soluble ACE2 recombinant protein ameliorates lung injury in vivo. the combination of clinical findings and preclinical studies has revealed a critical role of RAS in the pathogenesis of RSV-induced lung injury. modulation of ACE2 expression and/or blocking lung injury response may represent pharmacological approaches to alleviate RSV-induced lung disease."}
