{"summary": "in the united states, there are between 75,000 and 125,000 children hospitalized each year due to complications associated with RSV infection (2). in the united states, there are between 75,000 and 125,000 children hospitalized each year due to complications associated with RSV infection. the first seven genes found in all paramyxoviruses encode 11 structural and nonstructural proteins. the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) encapsulate the viral RNA to form a helical assembly termed the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) this structure protects the RNA and forms the minimal replication machinery. the three additional genes contained in the genomes of Pneumovirus genus members are the two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2) and M2. NS1 and NS2 are type I interferon antagonists (10). the M2 gene encodes two distinct proteins, M2-1 and M2-2, which have been shown to function in genome transcription and replication (24\u201326). the dSTORM technique uses two different laser wavelengths to convert organic fluorophores in a sample to a stable dark state. the dSTORM technique allows for the specific localization of viral proteins at a resolution less than the width of typical RSV viral particles (200 nm) hRSV virus was grown in HEp-2 cells under batch conditions. purified to a viral particle count of 6 109 viral particles/ml. purified virus was flash-frozen (plunge frozen) onto glow-discharged Quantifoil grids. images were acquired with pixel sizes of 0.764 nm and 0.45 nm on the specimen. total electron dose of 120 e/A2 was fractionated over individual tilt series ranging from 62\u00b0 to +62\u00b0. radius1 (r1) and radius2 (r2) were measured locally for spherical viruses without M, spherical viruses with M, and filamentous viruses using ImageJ (44) the two principle curvature values (c) were calculated (c1 = 1/r1 and c2 = 1/r2) and the Gaussian curvature (K = c1 c2) were also determined (45). s were plated on no. 1.5 coverslips 1 day prior to infection or imaging. cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Lonza) subsequently incubated with Opti-MEM containing 30 nM RNA imaging probes and 0.2 U/ml activated streptolysin O (Sigma) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. multiple antibody labeling was done simultaneously after checking for cross-reactivity. cells were then stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for virus on glass, before fixation, virus was centrifuged through 5-m-pore-size and 0.45-m-pore-size filters (Millipore) at 5,000 g and 4\u00b0C for 4 min and 1 min, respectively,. anti-RSV M (B135; a gift from James E. Crowe Jr.'s lab), mouse anti-RSV M2-1 (5H5; Abcam) secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen), donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrog images were recorded using a 60-magnification, 1.2-NA water immersion objective (Olympus) and an Evolve 512 EM CCD camera. total number of frames acquired per channel ranged from 2,000 to 4,000 frames. 1% bovine serum albumin was incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with primary antibodies diluted in a solution containing 0.25% gelatin, 0.5% donkey serum, and 1% BSA in PBS. after a wash, the ligation, amplification, and subsequent washing steps were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. a polyclonal goat anti-RSV primary (Abcam) was then immunostained to label viral particles. Cryo-ET data collection was performed by using two microscopes. a JEOL JEM-2200FS 200-kV FEG-TEM (JEOL Ltd., Japan) with a Zernike-style phase plate system, an in-column Omega-style energy filter (slit width, 20 eV) and a 4k-by-4k Gatan Ultrascan charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera. direct volume rendering, z-slice progressions, and quantitative rendering were done with Amira 5.4.1 (Visualization Sciences Group) averaged linear profiles were generated from multiple representative hRSV particles for the three classes of hRSV particle morphologies using the ImageJ software package (44). graphical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software), while Prism, StatPlus, and Microsoft Excel were used for statistical analysis. unbound oligonucleotides were removed via centrifugation in a 30-kDa filter (Millipore) hep-2 human epithelial cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Lonza) hep-2 human epithelial cells were washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+. cell-associated virus was harvested by scraping when cells displayed a high degree of cytopathic effect (CPE) for 1 h before fresh medium was added to the inoculum. RNA imaging probes were delivered to cells according to the probe delivery method section before the cells were scraped. cells were incubated with M2-1 primary, then rabbit anti-mouse Fab fragment. then a donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody, followed by a light fixation in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. cells were stained for viral M and F according to the standard protocol given above. superresolution images were recorded with a Vutara SR 200 (Vutara, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) commercial microscope based on single molecule localization (SML) biplane FPALM technology (47, 48) Viral proteins and MTRIP probes were imaged using 647-nm and 561-nm excitation lasers, respectively, and a 405-nm activation laser in a photoswitching buffer comprised of 20 m the image resolution capable of being achieved experimentally is 20 nm laterally (x and y) and 50 nm axially (z) proximity ligation assay (PLA) was performed according to the duolink II kit manufacturer's instructions (Olink Bioscience) with slight modifications to the diluents. 146 tomograms of viral particles were analyzed in the purified viral samples. despite the differences in shape, all particles shared similar ultrastructural arrangement. the organization of the virus particles was examined by the application of linear profile measurements across regions of the viruses. common structural features present in 3D reconstructions of all hRSV morphologies include the surface glycoproteins, the viral membrane, the matrix protein layer, and RNP. images are 7.5-nm central slices from tomographic reconstructions. models that represent the major structural features present in each group. the RNP of group 2 viruses (Fig. 3B, E, and H) was densely packed within the viral particles. the arrangement of RNP was so dense that no interaction points between RNP and M could be detected. asymmetric and filamentous viruses had more irregularly shaped patches of M than the filamentous viruses. average genome length of 1.48 m was calculated using the previously determined genome length, pitch, and subunits per helix turn of the hRSV helix. the number of RNPs varied significantly among spherical viral particles. the average length of one full genome was calculated to be 1.48 m. the left y axis notes the total RNP length in nm, the right y axis corresponds to the number of genome copies. the x axis corresponds to the number of genome copies. filamentous hRSV particles had a 1.5 greater SA/V ratio than their spherical hRSV counterparts. asymmetric particles had a higher proportion of M than the spherical particles, but this proportion was highly variable. asymmetric particles had a higher proportion of M than the spherical particles. spherical viral particles that did not contain M were positively curved in both axes and did not deviate from the character of a traditional spherical object. a larger calculated value indicates a membrane with greater curvature. the previous colocalization analyses were performed in cells and not with purified viral particles. however, the exact localization of M2-1 compared to other macromolecules within intact viruses had not been determined. from the conventional cryo-ET data, we observed small individual densities between the M layer and RNP. fected HEp-2 cells using laser scanning confocal microscopy. from these images, we found that the M protein was distributed throughout the cell's cytoplasm, as well as within viral filaments extending from the cell surface. we also found that M2-1 was located in viral filaments, although at lower quantities than M. this finding supports the hypothesis that M2-1 is part of the structure of a mature hRSV virion. to further investigate the localization of M2-1, we imaged filamentous viral particles isolated from infected cell monolayers using dSTORM. both the M protein (Fig. 9A) and the M2-1 protein (Fig. 9B) were distributed throughout the length of the filament; the M was distributed continuously, and the M2-1 coincided more frequently with the genomic RNA. this was more evident in side views where there was both protein and genomic RNA (Fig. 9A and B, side views and boxe imaging probes that was immunostained for the viral M2-1 protein are shown. axial FWHM of the point count for the viral protein and RNA in the 100-nm boxed region of the filaments shown in panels A and B. virions labeled with FLAG-tagged MTRIPs on glass were assayed for interactions between FLAG and either M (A) or M2-1 (B) by PLA. virions were also immunostained for pan-RSV for context. culture supernatant, 146 tomograms of viral particles were analyzed. despite the differences in shape, all particles shared similar ultrastructural arrangement. all virus types contained areas with the glycoproteins protruding from the viral membrane. common structural features present in 3D reconstructions of all hRSV morphologies include the surface glycoproteins, the viral membrane, the matrix protein layer, and RNP. images are 7.5-nm central slices from tomographic reconstructions. models represent the major structural features present in each group. the RNP of group 2 viruses (Fig. 3B, E, and H) was densely packed within the viral particles. the arrangement of RNP was so dense that no interaction points between RNP and M could be detected. asymmetric and filamentous viruses had more irregularly shaped patches of M than the filamentous viruses. average genome length of 1.48 m was calculated using the previously determined genome length, pitch, and subunits per helix turn of the hRSV helix. the number of RNPs varied significantly among spherical viral particles. the average length of one full genome was calculated to be 1.48 m. the left y axis notes the total RNP length in nm, the right y axis corresponds to the number of genome copies. the x axis corresponds to the number of genome copies. filamentous hRSV particles had a 1.5 greater SA/V ratio than their spherical hRSV counterparts. asymmetric particles had a higher proportion of M than the spherical particles. this proportion was highly variable, suggesting that M did not control the SA/V ratio in asymmetric particles. spherical viral particles that did not contain M were positively curved in both axes and did not deviate from the character of a traditional spherical object. curves, c1 and c2, were measured on local, equivalent segmented areas for each particle type. the previous colocalization analyses were performed in cells and not with purified viral particles. however, the exact localization of M2-1 compared to other macromolecules within intact viruses had not been determined. from the conventional cryo-ET data, we observed small individual densities between the M layer and RNP. infected HEp-2 cells using laser scanning confocal microscopy. from these images, we found that the M protein was distributed throughout the cell's cytoplasm, as well as within viral filaments extending from the cell surface. this finding supports the hypothesis that M2-1 is part of the structure of a mature hRSV virion. to further investigate the localization of M2-1, we imaged filamentous viral particles isolated from infected cell monolayers using dSTORM. both the M protein (Fig. 9A) and the M2-1 protein (Fig. 9B) were distributed throughout the length of the filament;
