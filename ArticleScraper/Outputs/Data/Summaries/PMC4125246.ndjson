{"summary": "over one-half of all known human pathogens originated from animals. over 75% of emerging infectious diseases identified in the last three decades were zoonotic. recent infectious diseases have been concentrated in tropical Africa, Latin America, and Asia. positive PCR products were purified, sequenced, and analyzed on an ABI Prism 3130 Automated Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) of 217 fecal swabs tested, adenovirus DNA was detected in 4 samples from Chaerephon sp. (N = 2) and Otomops martiensseni (N = 2); paramyxovirus RNA was detected in 2 samples from Chaerephon sp. (N four bats (KY149, KY151, KY166, and KY291) tested positive on kidney, lung, and liver tissues. the KY159 bat kidney and lung tissues were coinfected with two different types of paramyxoviruses. one sequence represented a rubula-related virus (KY159b) three caves 1 Shimoni cave 1 No information 2 Rhinolophus clivosus Nairobi 5 Rhinolophus hildebrandtii Chyulu National Park 4 Rousettus aegyptiacus 3 caves 11 3 Kitum cave 10 1 Makingeny cave 9 Watamu cave 6 1 1 Taphozous nudiventris Marungu 2 Taphozous hildegarde Shimoni cave 3 Total 217 4 11 canine adenoviruses 1 and 2 and the bat adenoviruses share a common ancestor. these four Kenya bat adenovirus sequences share 58\u201366% nucleotide identity with their most closely related adenoviruses: bat adenoviruses 2 and 3. the rhabdovirus phylogenetic tree was generated based on partial RDRP gene sequences (219 nucleotides) from representative known rhabdoviruses. the trees are drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. these nine sequences formed five distinct lineages (KY196, KY291, KY241, KY248, KY149-KY151-KY159a-KY162-KY166) with 72\u201378% nucleotide identity between each lineage. one sequence (KY283) identified in R. aegyptiacus was grouped with another known bat henipavirus-related virus identified in a R. aegyptia paramyxoviruses phylogenetic trees were generated based on (A) amplicon sequences (305 nucleotides) from generic RT-PCR assays of the subgroup Respirovirus-Morbillivirus-Henipavirus. the trees are drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. many bat adenoviruses have been described that are related to canine adenovirus types 1 and 2. we were unable to obtain sequences from the same region of the genome for direct comparison. the concurrent detection of both RNA and DNA viruses in apparently healthy bats supports evidence that bats may be carriers of more than one virus."}
