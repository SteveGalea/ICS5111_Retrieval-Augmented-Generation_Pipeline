{"summary": "acute infection with the respiratory pathogen, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), results in local production of the proinflammatory chemokine, CCL3. neutrophil recruitment in response to PVM infection was diminished five-fold in IFN receptor gene-deleted mice. a minimal intranasal inoculum (30 \u2013 100 pfu) results in robust virus replication within bronchial epithelial cells that is accompanied by profound granulocyte recruitment. in the absence of pharmacologic intervention, PVM infection progresses to pulmonary edema and respiratory compromise. IFN is also detected in BAL fluid of BALB/c mice in response to challenge with RSV virions. local production of IFN is a prominent response to PVM infection [12,29,30], although its role in modulating the primary inflammatory response has not yet been fully explored. there is a significant correlation between levels of immunoreactive IFN and CCL3 in mouse lung tissue in response to PVM infection. the expression profile of CCL3 (MIP-1), a chemokine crucial for neutrophil recruitment in response to PVM infection, is overdrawn with a blue line. feron inducible protein 1 Ifi1 NM_008326 0.961 Interferon-stimulated protein Isg20 BC022751 0.953 Interferon-induced GTPase Igtp NM_018738 0.953 Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 6 Ifitm6 BB193024 0.950 CXC chemokine ligand 11 (IP-9) Cxcl11 NM_019494 0.9 interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Il1rn M57525 0.947 Regulator of G-protein signaling 19 interacting protein 1 Rgs19ip1 NM_018771 0.943 Interleukin-6 Il6 NM_031168 0.937 CD244 natural killer cell receptor 2B4 Cd244 NM_018729 0.928 CSF2 receptor Csf2rb2 NM_007781 0.928 Fc receptor, Ig domain containing 1 Oact1 AV366860 0.960 Lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 Lcp2 BC006948 0.959 Solute carrier family 15, member 3 Slc15a3 NM_023044 0.956 Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3 dioxygenase Indo NM_008324 0.954 Proteosome subunit beta type 9 Tap1 AW048052 0.952 Phospholipase A1 member A Pla histocompatibility 2, complement component factor B H2-Bf NM_008198 0.933 ATP binding cassette Abcc5 BB436535 0.933 Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase Ch25h NM_009890 0.932 BING 4 protein Bing4 C78559 0.932 Thymidylate kinase, LPS inducible Tyki AK004595 0.930 Tripartite motif protein 30 Trim30 BM240719 'find similar' function was used to inspect all transcript profiles for patterns related to that displayed by IFN-. only a small fraction (2%) of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells detected at this time point stained positively for IFN. 0.9 103 cells stained positively for IFN, an increase from 0.3 0.08 103 cells. 4% of total NK cells detected in a single lung from uninfected mice. IFN-dependent responses to PVM infection Wild type and IFN receptor gene deleted mice were infected with PVM. neutrophils from IFNR gene-deleted mice express transcripts encoding CCR1, the major receptor for CCL3. the EC50s and maximum calcium fluxes detected were indistinguishable between the wild type and gene-deleted strains. immunoreactive CCL3 was detected in lung tissue homogenates [Figure 4A]. no CCL3-positive cells were detected in lung tissue from mice challenged with control vector (vctrl) no inflammation was observed in lung tissue of IFN -/- mice in response to CCL3 overexpression alone. findings include moderate peribronchiolar granulocytic infiltration and substantial parenchymal involvement. weight loss is sustained among the mice overexpressing CCL3. IFN- mRNA levels peak at day 7 after inoculation, and fall rapidly to baseline between days 7 \u2013 14. a close correlation (0.965) between expression patterns of IFN and CCL3 (MIP-1) (MIP-1) is key for granulocyte recruitment in response to PVM infection. expression profile of CCL3 (MIP-1) is overdrawn with a blue line.

EC50s and maximum calcium fluxes were indistinguishable between wild type and gene-deleted neutrophils. inflammatory responses to IFN and CCL3 We examined neutrophil recruitment in response to CCL3 overexpression in IFN gene-deleted mice. at the microscopic level, no inflammation was observed in lung tissue of IFN -/- mice in response to CCL3 overexpression alone. IFN- gene-deleted mice were challenged with (B) vCCL3 + med or (C) vCCL3 + IFN. changes in body weight in response to CCL3 overexpression IFN-; *p 0.01 at time points shown. granulocyte recruitment is a primary finding in severe respiratory virus infection. activation of granulocytes can result in the release of proinflammatory cytokines. these cytokines alone are not sufficient to induce the inflammatory state that ultimately promotes lung damage and respiratory failure. both CCL3 and IFN have been detected in human studies and in mouse models of other severe respiratory virus infections. the potential for interplay between these specific signaling pathways has not been considered previously. the current literature on interactions of IFN with granulocytes was recently reviewed. mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected dendritic cells from IL-12p40 gene-deleted mice were also overproducing the cytokine IL-10. most intriguing, addition of IL-10 to wild-type dendritic cells reproduced the inhibited chemotaxis response. the mechanism via which IFN modulates neutrophil responses to CCL3 is an intriguing subject for future exploration. mice were inoculated with 150 l of stock (50 l/dose 3 doses) to achieve challenges of 1.0 \u2013 1.5 1011 pfu per mouse. mice received 15 g recombinant murine IFN diluted in tissue culture medium (RPMI + 10% fetal calf serum) cells were suspended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 U/mL streptomycin, 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids. cells were stained with I-Ad FITC, DX5-PE, CD3-PE-Cy5, CD4 PerCP/Cy5.5, IFN PE T cells were identified as I-A-, CD3+ and either CD4+ or CD8+. NK cells were identified as I-A-, CD3+ or CD8+ as indicated. the entire sample was analyzed (typically 2 \u2013 4 105 events) the standard curve for mouse GAPDH included serial dilutions of the coding sequence. the standard curve for mouse CCR1 included serial dilutions of the coding sequence (GenBank Accession # U28404) in pCEP4. the constructs were linearized with Pme I and transformed into an E. coli strain, (BJ5183), which contains the replication-incompetent pAD-1 backbone. recombinants were selected for kanamycin resistance, and recombinants subsequently identified by restriction digestion. of CCL3 and IFN were determined in BAL fluid (pg/ml) isolated from five mice per datapoint using commercially available ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) total protein was determined the Bradford colorimetric assay using bovine serum albumin standards Gross and microscopic pathology and immunohistochemical detection of CCL3 Paraffin blocks of formalin-fixed lung tissue from mice challenged with vctrl or vCCL3 were paraffin-em mice were anaesthetized and inoculated by intranasal challenge. mice were inoculated with 150 l of stock (50 l/dose 3 doses) to achieve challenges of 1.0 \u2013 1.5 1011 pfu. vctrl yielded 323 28 pg IFN/mg lung on day 4 post-inoculation. cells were incubated for 6 hrs at 37\u00b0C at a density of 1 106 cells/ml with 1 M ionomycin, 20 ng/ml phorbol-12-myristate acetate and stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis. controls were stained with isotype matched antibodies. samples were acquired with a 4-laser LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) absolute quantification of CCR1 expression Total RNA was isolated from neutrophils elicited from wild type and IFNR -/- mice using the RT2 qPCR-Grade RNA Isolation Kit (SuperArray Bioscience Corporation) the cDNA was prepared using the 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-PCR (AMV; Roche Applied Science) vctrl and control (vctrl) overexpression vectors were challenged with various concentrations of CCL3, buffer alone (negative control) or f-MLF (positive control) the constructs were linearized with Pme I and transformed into an E. coli strain, (BJ5183) BAL fluids were harvested from 5 mice by trans-tracheal instillation and removal of pre-chilled phosphate-buffered saline with 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA; 0.80 ml instillation with recovery of 0.5 to 0.6 ml per mouse. total protein was determined by visual inspection of methanol-fixed cytospin preparations stained with modified Giemsa.
