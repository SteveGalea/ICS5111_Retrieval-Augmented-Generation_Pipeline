{"summary": "clinical knowledge of severe CAP and acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by HAdV-55 is still limited. clinical knowledge of severe CAP and acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by HAdV-55 is still limited, though the pathogen has been fully characterized by whole-genome sequencing. community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. HAdVs are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses, ubiquitous in the environment. adenoviruses (HAdVs) are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. dV-55 accounts for more than 40% of identified HAdV positive samples. the serotypes of HAdV may be one of the factors which determine the severity of adenoviral pneumonia. the pathogen has been fully characterized by whole-genome sequencing. current knowledge of HAdV-55-induced severe pneumonia is mainly derived from single case reports or relatively small, single-center series. lower respiratory tract samples, urine, blood, and acute and convalescent serum samples were collected for thorough microbiological tests. patients with HIV infection or neutropenia, those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy, pregnant women and malignant neoplasms were excluded. specimens that were positive for HAdV were subjected to a multiplex PCR assay. PCR targeting the hexon gene was performed again with type-specific primers. the PCR products were purified (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) severe HAdV CAP was confirmed by positive multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HAdV from lower respiratory tract samples, such as sputum, tracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. patients with HIV infection or neutropenia, those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy, pregnant or breast-feeding women, and malignant neoplasms were excluded. multiplex real-time PCR was performed to screen for HAdV, rhinovirus, cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. specimens that were positive for HAdV were subjected to further analysis to determine the type of HAdV. a total of 15 cases were confirmed with HAdV as the only pathogen of pneumonia. two patients with HAdV positive samples were excluded due to possible coinfection with Legionella pneumophila and S. pneumonia respectively. male gender (73.3%) was more common than female gender. flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough and little sputum, were most commonly observed at the onset of illness. all patients presented with a high fever, with a median body temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (range, 39.0\u00b0C to 40.8\u00b0C), which persisted for 7 days (range, 1 to 10 days) most clinical symptoms and signs between survivors and non-survivors did not differ. 1(25) 0.569 Clinical features Duration before admission, days 7 (6\u201310) 7 (6\u20138) 8.5(4.8\u201310) 0.640 Initial PSI score 95(68\u2013116) 84(62\u201398) 127.5(103.3\u2013175) 0.013 Duration before identification of HAdV, days 11(10\u201313) 11(10\u201313) 12.5(9.8\u201313.8) 0.510 HAdV-55 11(73.3) 8(72.8) 3(75) 1.0 0.170 Respiratory rate, breaths/min 26(21\u201330) 24(21\u201327) 33(27.3\u201346.3) 0.022 MAP, mm Hg 80.7(75.3\u201392.7) 80.7(75.3\u201392.3) 94.7(55.3\u2013121.9) 0.472 PaO2 /FiO2 ratio, mm Hg 120(75\u2013162) 152(97.1\u2013200) 71(50.3\u201385.8) 0.019 Coin 0\u201310.5) 7.3(6.1\u201310.6) 4.1 (1.3\u20139.1) 0.117 Neutrophil, % 85.3 (80.3\u201388.9) 84.3 (80.3\u201387) 93.1 (71.5\u201395.1) 0.151 Lymphocyte, % 10.1(7.3\u201312) 10.2(8.1\u201312.0) 6.2(4.5\u201324.3) 0.192 Hematocrit, % 38.4(34.4\u201341.1) 38.4(30.7\u201340.4) 39.8 radiographic features Consolidation (86.7%), ground-grass opacities (GGOs) and pleural effusions (73.3%) were the most common findings in severe HAdV CAP. three patients showed bilateral multiple consolidations accompanied by GGOs in two patients. the most commonly involved lobe was the right lower lobe (n = 5), followed by the left lower lobe (n = 3), left upper lobe (n = 1), and right upper lobe (n = 1). follow-up radiologic findings in 13 patients with consolidation showed the rapid development of bilateral consolidations within 10 days after illness onset. ten out of 15 patients received adjuvant intravenous immunoglobulin for 3\u20135 days. fourteen (93.3%) received corticosteroids for 3\u201310 days. one case died of respiratory failure caused by ARDS. most patients (14 of 15 patients) came from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of northern china. most HAdVs (60%) were identified in April. most cases of human adenovirus type 55 were identified in April. white blood cell counts in most patients were in the normal range. serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine phosphokinase (CK), creatinine and urea nitrogen levels were higher in non-survivors. spnea 13(86.7) 10(90.9) 3(75) 1.476 Dyspnea before admission, days 3(1.5\u20134) 3(1.8\u20134.3) 3(1\u20134) 0.793 Chest pain 3(20.0) 3(27.3) 0(0) 0.516 Diarrhea 3(20.0) 2(18.2) 1(25.0) 1.0 Myalgia 3(20.0) 3(27.3) 0(0) 0.5 4.5(3.3\u201318.5) 0.116 Duration of MV, days 7.5(4.8\u201313.3) 8.5(5.8\u201313.3) 4.5(3.3\u201318.5) 0.356 CAP, community-acquired pneumonia; PSI, pneumonia severity index; HAdV, human adenovirus; MAP, mean arterial pressure; IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin. g/L 29.3(24.5\u201332.9) 31(24.8\u201332.9) 26.9(24.13\u201332.2 0.695 LDH, U /L 340(326\u20131074) 338(279\u20131057) 1032.5(370.8\u20131805.3) 0.151 CK, U /L 111(94\u2013840) 100(684\u2013408) 1344(116.3\u20132164.5) 0.090 Tbil, mmol/L 16.4 radiographic features Consolidation (86.7%), ground-grass opacities (GGOs) and pleural effusions (73.3%) were the most common findings in severe HAdV CAP. three patients showed bilateral multiple consolidations accompanied by GGOs in two patients. initial CT scan obtained on day 7 shows apparent consolidation with slight patchy ground-glass opacities in both lower lungs. oseltamivir was used in all eight patients who received antiviral drugs. the need for mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressors were similar between non-survivors and survivors. HAdV accounted for 0.8% of adult acute respiratory tract infections in china between 2005 and 2010. HAdV-3 was the most frequently detected serotype. the clinical features and disease progression of our cases are highly similar to those of ARDS caused by HAdV-55 or other types of HAdV. common manifestations of HAdV infection such as diarrhea or conjunctivitis were not common in our patients. to date, adenovirus pneumonia is the only virus known to cause focal or lobar consolidation as its main imaging abnormality. adenovirus pneumonia may mislead diagnosis and treatment. 10 out of 18 patients received corticosteroids in a study focused on severe CAP caused by HAdV-55. total mortality was 5.9%. HAdV-55 plays a very important role in cases of adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults of northern china. day 21 after onset with residual consolidation in the lower lobe."}
