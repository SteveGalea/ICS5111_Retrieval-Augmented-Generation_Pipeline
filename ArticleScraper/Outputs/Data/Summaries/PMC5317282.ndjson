{"summary": "a quasi-experimental study was performed to investigate situations of antibiotic use in secondary and tertiary general hospitals in Tianjin from April 2011 to 2013. five major indicators were analyzed: percentage of antibiotic use in inpatient cases (%), antibacterial use density (AUD), proportion of prophylactic antibiotic application for type I surgical incisions (0.5\u20132.0 h before such procedures) the Ministry of Health (MOH) of the People\u2019s Republic of China released the \u201cNationwide Special Campaign for antibiotic Stewardship Program (ASP) 2011\u201d and conducted a specific rectification of irrational antibiotic use in china [6\u201310]. in this study, we investigated and analyzed the changes in relevant indicators in antibiotic use in 41 medical organizations. the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions given to emergency patients cannot exceed 40.00%. prophylactic antibiotic use should be performed 0.5\u20132 h before surgery. antibiotic selection and treatment course must be rational. the Antibiotic Stewardship Program (ASP) in 2011\u20132013 was led by a working group of the Infection Quality Control Center in Tianjin Health Bureau. the working group examined the clinical use of antibacterial drug in April 2011, April 2012, and April 2013 in the 41 hospitals. notification was made in cases of unreasonable antibiotic use. assessment of prescriptions Antibiotic prescriptions were analyzed and assessed by infection experts and hospital quality control centers. on-site feedback was provided to each hospital regarding several issues of antibiotic use, including overuse, the presence of name redundancies for generic formulas, drug selection and distribution challenges. on-site feedback was provided to each hospital regarding several issues of antibiotic use. antibiotic use data were collected through inpatient medical records (1 year defined as 1 cycle) in April of each year, starting from 2011, for 3 consecutive years. the data on antibiotic consumption were normalized to defined daily doses (DDD)/100 days for inpatients. AUD was defined as DDDs per 100 patient days. AUD = total antibiotics consumption average length of hospital stay/total number of patients discharged over same period 100. clinical training was provided by a multidisciplinary team of experts in the areas of infection control, refractory disease strategies, perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, laboratory-to-clinic microbiology communication, conditions for initial hospital visit of acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients. training was provided in the following areas: acquisition of common infectious diseases during long-term hospitalization. training courses were provided in areas of infection control, refractory disease strategies, perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, laboratory-to-clinic microbiology communication, conditions for initial hospital visit of acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients and protection of medical staff. other courses of interest included the establishment of temporary quarantine zones for newly admitted patients, recent advances in environmental disinfection, infections resulting from unsanitary hospitals. in general hospitals were monitored via antibiotic use and resistance surveillance networks. electronic prescription systems can increase the rate of standardized prescriptions. the ratios of antibiotic use in hospitalized patients are mainly presented as percentages. the compliance rate of antibiotic prophylaxis for 24 h in patients undergoing type I surgical incision operations significantly increased from 40.30% to 96.37% (p0.05) the percentage of antibiotic prophylactic use for 24 h in patients with type I incision operations increased from 86.67% to 25.08%. the percentages of antibiotic use by inpatients and AUD were reduced from 61.27% to 44.84% and from 49.18 DDDs to 35.90 DDDs. the compliance rate of antibiotic prophylactic use for 24 h in patients with type I incision operations increased from 50.00% to 97%. antibiotic use by inpatients (%) 61.27 53.15* 44.84* 27.268# 0.000# AUD of inpatients (DDD/100 patient days) 49.18 40.65 35.90* 10.235# 0.000# Proportion of prophylactic antibiotic application for type I incision operation (%) 100.00 67.90* 28.86* 20.303# 0.000# Compliance rate of antibiotic prophylactic use 0.5\u20132.0 h before type I incision operation (%) 25* 46.88* 50.226# 0.000# AUD of inpatients (DDD/100 patient days) 51.60 37.75* 35.37* 27.838# 0.000# Proportion of prophylactic antibiotic application for type I incision operation (%) 86.67 32.1* 25.08* 51.148# 0.000# Compliance rate of antibiotic prophylactic use 0.5\u20132.0 h before type I incision operation (%) 40.30 87.50* 96. prophylactic antibiotic application for type I incision operation decreased from 100% to 28.86%. compliance rate of antibiotic prophylactic use for 24 h increased from 50.00% to 97%. phylactic use 0.5\u20132.0 h before type I incision operation 98.84 100.00 100.00 1.483# 0.246# Compliance rate of antibiotic prophylactic use for 24 h in patients receiving type I incision operations. irrational antibiotic use can accelerate the emergence of antibiotic resistance. unreasonable antibiotic use can be controlled through education and training of clinicians, clinical pharmacists, and nurses. misunderstandings occurred with respect to public knowledge of antibiotic use. some misunderstood the concept of antibiotics, exaggerating their efficacy and abusing them via direct purchase over-the-counter at drug stores. the overall resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbapenem and to meropenem has declined in both tertiary and secondary hospitals from 2010\u20132012. the overall resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased for meropenem (38.9% to 11.2%), ciprofloxacin (26.5% to 12.4%), and imipenem (41.5% to 22%) over the period of study biotic use management is a complicated issue and a long-term challenge. significant improvements have been achieved in antibiotic use in Tianjin through the ASP campaign."}
