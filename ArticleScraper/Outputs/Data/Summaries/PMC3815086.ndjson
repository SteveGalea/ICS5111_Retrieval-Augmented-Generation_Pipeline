{"summary": "gDNA and cDNA antibody libraries were constructed using the gDNAs and mRNAs isolated from uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals. the frequencies of putative germline antibodies of known bnmAbs in the gDNA and cDNA libraries were determined. the human gDNA antibody gene repertoires may have more potential than the cDNA repertoires to develop HIV-1 bnAbs. many new and more potent bnmAbs have been reported in the past 3 years. many new and more potent bnmAbs have been reported in the past 3 years. many new and more potent bnmAbs were reported in the past 3 years. deep sequencing of the cDNA-PCR products of memory B cells obtained from several \u2018elite controllers\u2019 at different time points postinfection further revealed the limited use of heavy chain V-gene (IGHV) lineages for developing HIV-1 bnAbs in a single infected individual. we hypothesized that antibody gene repertoire at the gDNA level may be more diverse than that at the cDNA level. PBMCs from patients 2 and 3 were obtained from the University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong, China) PBMCs from patients 2 and 3 (pt2 and pt3) were obtained from the National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, China CDC (Beijing, China) all these experiments were approved by ethical committees of the respective institutes. gDNA was used as a template for amplification of heavy chain variable regions. kappa and lambda light chain variable regions were pooled. mRNA was prepared from the pooled total RNA using the \u2018Oligotex mRNA Mini Kit\u2019 (Qiagen) semi-nested PCR products were gel-purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) the purified heavy chain variable regions and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions were covalently linked by a flexible (G4S)3 linker by SOE-PCR to assemble scFvs. the Fab fragments were then ligated to pComb3X. the ligated products electroporated into TG1 electrocompetent cells. pt1 was infected with clade B virus whose serum exhibited high titres of broadly neutralizing activity. Isolation of genomic DNA, total RNA and mRNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. five to ten million PBMCs were collected from each 5 ml of heparinized whole blood. the gDNA was used as a template for amplification of heavy chain variable regions and kappa and lambda light chain variable regions by semi-nested PCR. each first round of PCR was carried out in a reaction volume of 100 l containing 90 ng gDNA as a template by running the following PCR programme. initial denaturing at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, 10 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 45\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 45 s, 20 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 45 s and an extension cycle of 72\u00b0C for lambda light chains by PCR using high-fidelity DNA polymerase and primers annealing to FR1s and FR4s of human antibody heavy chain variable regions. the human antibody heavy chain first constant domain sequence was then attached to the heavy chain variable regions by SOE-PCR to assemble Fds. light chains and Fds were then electroporated into TG1 electrocompetent cells. the resultant combinatorial gDNA scFv library contained over 600 million individual clones. each immune gDNA scFv library contained one to six billion individual clones. each sublibrary contained 1\u20136 billion individual clones. gDNA libraries were more diverse overall than the cDNA libraries in using various IGHV lineages. pt2gH and pt3gH showed a similar pattern of various IGHV lineage usage. pt2gH and pt3gH were significantly different from pt1gH in using IGHV1 and IGHV3 lineages. the patterns of various IGKV/IGLV lineage usages in the nonimmune and immune gDNA libraries were similar except for pt1gK library. both nonimmune and immune cDNA libraries heavily used IGKV3 and IGLV1 lineages. these results indicate that HIV-1 infection shapes the patterns of various IGHV lineage usages. kappa light chain V-gene/lambda light chain V-gene lineages in nonimmune and immune genomic DNA and cDNA libraries. pt1\u20133gK/L, nonimmune gDNA scFv library; pt1\u20133gK/L, patient gDNA Fab library; pt1\u20133gK/L, patient gDNA Fab library; pt1\u20133gK/L we found a total of five, 10 and two productive heavy chain variable regions (with in-frame junctions) in the cDNA libraries with exactly the same putative VDJ recombinations as VRC01, VRC03 and NIH45\u201346 respectively. however, their junction regions and the length of the HCDR3s were very different compared with the respective bnmAbs. this suggests the unlikelihood for them to mature to VRC01-like bn bnmAbs VHs IGHJ IGHD IGHJ NIgH pt1gH pt2gH pt3gH NIH pt2gH b12 HV1-3*01 HD2-21*01 F HJ6*03 F 0 0 0 0 0 VRC01 HV1-2*02 HD2-21*01 HJ2*01 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 3BNC60 VH, heavy chain variable region; VK, kappa light chain variable region; VL, lambda light chain variable region. the frequencies of the kappa light chain variable regions that had the identical VJ recombinations to the known HIV-1 bnmAbs were included for comparison. kappa light chain variable regions with the identical VJ recombination to b12 kappa light chain variable region (IGKV3\u201320/IGKJ2) were relatively high. the frequencies of lambda light chain variable regions with the identical VJ recombination to b12 were relatively high. X5 also had a long HCDR3 (24 amino acids), so the frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions that used the same or very similar IGHV of X5 were not higher than the frequencies of the heavy chain variable regions with exactly the same VDJ recombinations of X5. similar analysis of trim kappa/lambda light chain variable regions also showed relatively high frequencies of the VKs/VLs that used the same or very similar IGKV 05 17 AA 0 7 0 0 37 24 227 PG9 HV3\u201333*01,05,06;4\u201361*02,03 30 AA 0 0 0 0 PGT127 HV4\u201339*03,06,07;4\u201361*05;4-b*02 25 AA 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 X5 HV1\u201369*01,05,06,12,13 24 AA 2 3 AA 377 NA 266 320 675 1201 298 PGT127 IGLV2\u20138, IGLV2-11 10 AA 143 26 179 522 343 142 X5 KV3\u201320, KV3D-20, KV3-NL5, KV3D-7 9 AA 181 5 218 155 1805 1655 2103 m396 IGLV3\u201321, IGLV3\u20139 10 AA 9 NA 0 0 61 each immune gDNA scFv library had kappa and lambda sublibraries. each sublibrary contained one to six billion individual clones. each sublibrary contained 1\u20136 billion individual clones. gDNA libraries were more diverse overall than the cDNA libraries in using various IGHV lineages. differences between the gDNA and corresponding cDNA libraries were more significant than those between the nonimmune and immune gDNA or cDNA libraries. gDNA libraries were more diverse overall than the cDNA libraries in using various IGHV lineages. both nonimmune and immune cDNA antibody libraries heavily used IGKV3 and IGLV1 lineages. differences between the gDNA and cDNA antibody gene repertoires in HIV-1 uninfected (nonimmune) humans reflect host immune regulations. extremely low frequency of heavy chain variable regions and kappa/lambda light chain variable regions with identical V(D)J recombinations to known HIV-1 bnmAbs. we did not find any heavy chain variable regions that had identical VDJ recombinations to these known HIV-1 bnmAbs. we found four productive heavy chain variable regions in two immune gDNA libraries (1 in pt2gH and 3 in pt3gH) that had identical putative VDJ recombinations to X5. but all these heavy chain variable regions had a shorter HCDR3 than that of X5 (24 amino acids, AA) these results indicate that the chance of having a heavy chain variable region with a defined VDJ recombination along with a specific 3H b12 HV1-3*01 HD2-21*01 F HJ6*03 F 0 0 0 0 0 VRC01 HV1-2*02 HD2-21*01 HJ2*01 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 VRC03 HV1\u20132*02,04; HV1\u20138*01 HD2\u201321*01 HJ2*01 0 0 0 6 0 4 NIH45\u201346 HV1\u2013 RC01 IGKV3D-15 IGKJ2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3BNC60 IGKV1-33, IGKV1D-33 IGKJ3 0 0 1 2 0 PG9 IGLV2-14 IGLJ3 181 NA 100 167 381 605 195 PGT127 IGLV2\u20138 IGLJ2, IGLJ3 90 NA 13 114 483 255 the frequencies of the lambda light chain variable regions with the identical VJ recombination to m396 were relatively high. the frequencies of the kappa light chain variable regions with the identical VJ recombination to m396 were very low. similar analysis of trim kappa/lambda light chain variable regions showed relatively high frequencies of the VKs/VLs that used the same or very similar IGKVs/IGLVs. similar analysis of trim kappa/lambda light chain variable regions also showed relatively high frequencies of the VKs/VLs that used the same or very similar IGKVs/IGLVs. 02 25 AA 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 X5 HV1\u201369*01,05,06,12,13 24 AA 2 3 0 2 3 3 4 m396 HV1\u201369*01,02,04,05,09 11 AA 5 18 2 7 77 42 38 Total no. of trim VH sequences 33 436 23 530 44 027 42 160 80 331 74 053 77 176 BnmAbs VK IGLV3\u201321, IGLV3\u20139 10 AA 9 NA 0 0 61 141 230 Total no. of trim VK and VL sequences 23 670 21 254 19 162 17 285 26 902 26 508 27 639 CD4i mAb X5 and lambda light chain variable were included for comparison. frequencies of heavy chain variable regions and kappa/lambda light chain variable regions with identical putative V(D)J recombinations to known HIV-1 bnmAbs were extremely low in both nonimmune gDNA and cDNA libraries. if a certain combination of putative germline antibodies is required for HIV-1 bnmAbs, the chance for such direct maturation may be very low. light chain variable regions may be stimulated to induce bnAbs. the cDNA Fab libraries were constructed earlier and used in previous studies. we did not convert the Fab libraries to scFv libraries because it was not necessary. the differences may be amplified by host immune regulations to remove or functionally silence B-cells expressing autoimmune antibodies. this could lead to a different frequency of various germline antibody genes in the initial antibody gene repertoire for affinity maturation. this could lead to a different frequency of various germline antibody genes in the initial antibody gene repertoire for affinity maturation.
