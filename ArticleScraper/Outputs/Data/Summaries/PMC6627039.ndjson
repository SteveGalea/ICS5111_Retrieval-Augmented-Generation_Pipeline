{"summary": "the nuclear envelope (NE) provides a physical barrier that spatially separates the contents of the nucleus and cytoplasm at all stages of the cell cycle except during mitosis. the NE confines key cellular processes like transcription and translation to the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. this separation allows for complex regulation of gene expression and other distinguishing factors between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. the central channel of the NPC is a formidable gate-keeper. lower molecular weight molecules, including small proteins, are capable of diffusing through the NPC so long as they can interact with FG-Nups. as protein size increases, the ability for a protein to passively diffuse through the NPC diminishes greatly. a detailed review of mechanisms used by viruses to gain initial access to the nucleus was recently compiled by Kobiler et al.. many viruses inhibit cellular mRNA nuclear export to prevent expression of cellular mRNAs encoding antiviral factors. most karyopherins belong to the highly conserved karyopherin- (Kap) superfamily. they range from 14 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to at least 20 in humans. they can bind their cargo directly through the recognition of either a distinct nuclear localization signal (NLS) or nuclear export signal (NES) the classical Imp-/ pathway, Imp- directly, the nuclear pore complex (NPC), or transportin through a PY-nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) for nuclear import as well as Crm1 for nuclear export. in humans, seven different isoforms of Imp- exist, each of which. an advantage of using Imp- as an adapter is an expansion of the repertoire of cargos that can indirectly utilize Imp-1. a classical NLS (cNLS) is best exemplified by the viral Simian Virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (TAg) cNLS. the best characterized NLSs are those that bind TNPO1 and TNPO2 using a PY-NLS. the best characterized NLSs are those that bind TNPO1 and TNPO2 using a PY-NLS. some cargo proteins such as histone H3 are able to bind with high affinity without containing the PY motif. NES binding to Crm1 is generally conformationally unrestrained because there is lack of contact with the NES backbone. NESs are unusual in that they are able to bind Crm1 in either the N- to C-terminal or C- to N-terminal orientation, further enhancing the diversity of potential NESs [39,40]. a common theme among many viruses is their limited coding capacity. the most direct approach for viral proteins to traverse the NE is to target the NPC itself. this phenomenon is reserved for capsid interactions to bring viral genomic information into the nucleus. some viral proteins interact directly with the NPC. BGLF4 from Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and HIV-1 Vpr (48,49,50) viral proteins make use of either Imp- mediated import via the classic nuclear import pathway, surpass the adaptor in favor of a direct interaction with Imp-1. molecular mimicry of a cNLS, which would allow viral proteins to interact with Imp-1, is a common strategy used. viral proteins can mimic cNLSs at the amino acid level through convergent evolution. multiple viruses have been shown to bind Imp-1 directly to the nucleus. NS5 has a cNLS, which allows it to utilize the classical import pathway. however, NS5 is also capable of binding to Imp- directly. this interaction can be prevented by another deNV protein, NS3. many viral proteins interact with Crm1 and the nuclear export machinery. the main purpose of these proteins is to aid in nuclear export of viral mRNA. the main purpose of these proteins is to aid in nuclear export of viral mRNA. rabies virus uses multiple isoforms of its P protein to regulate nuclear import and export. in isoforms that are N-terminally truncated, the NLS overcomes the NES function leading to a largely nuclear accumulation of the protein. this phenomenon is likely important to the completion of each respective viral lifecycle. many viral proteins themselves must be transported into and out of the nucleus by employing a variety of nucleoporins or karyopherins. several instances of viral proteins that are not components of the capsid directly binding the NPC have been documented. BGLF4 from Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and HIV-1 Vpr (48,49,50) a simple yet effective approach to targeting cellular importins is through molecular mimicry of a cNLS. viral proteins make use of either Imp- mediated import via the classic nuclear import pathway, surpass the adaptor in favor of a direct interaction with Imp-1, or utilize other Imp- family members to enter the nucleus. molecular mimicry of SLiMs is a common strategy used by viruses to perturb or usurp host cell networks. viral proteins can mimic cNLSs at the amino acid level through convergent evolution. both IAV and dengue virus have been shown to have proteins that utilize multiple import mechanisms to enter the nucleus. the deNV NS5 protein can make use of either classical nuclear import via Imp-/ or through direct use of Imp- for nuclear import. NS5 is also capable of binding to Imp- directly. if the virus causes disassembly of the nuclear membrane, it needs to carefully manage the export of these components from the nucleus. many viral proteins interact with Crm1 and the nuclear export machinery. the main purpose of these proteins is to aid in nuclear export of viral mRNA. rabies virus uses multiple isoforms of its P protein to regulate nuclear import and export. rabies virus uses multiple isoforms of its P protein to regulate nuclear import and export. the host\u2019s innate immune response serves as a front-line defense against viral infection [103] central to the innate antiviral immune response is the activation of type I interferon (IFN) and NF-B signaling pathways. this leads to the expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) and the production of an array of proinflammatory cytokines that ultimately work to halt or delay viral replication. viruses have evolved strategies to target different components involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport as a means of blocking antiviral responses. one component that can be targeted to block innate antiviral responses is the karyopherin proteins, which are directly responsible for cargo recognition. hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease is involved in evading innate immunity. NS5 protein is able to bind Imp-3 and 4 to compete with IRF3 and NF-B p65 binding, preventing their nuclear import and ability to activate IFN signaling. other viruses have evolved similar mechanisms to target importins to evade host innate immunity. karyopherins and karyopherins are recruited to these structures to form a derivative of a functional NPC. a subset of Nups was increased during HCV infection, suggesting that these cytoplasmic NPCs are being built from newly synthesized Nups. the use of these NPC derived structures to regulate transport allows cellular proteins with NLSs to shuttle into the MW. human rhinovirus (HRV) and poliovirus (PV) are able to target nup153, a component of the NPC nuclear basket, and nucleoporins Nup62 and Nup98. 2Apro from HRV and PV specifically cleaves the FG-rich region from Nup62, a region involved in recognizing karyopherins and forming the inner channel of the NPC. IAV induces enlargement of the NPC by exploiting cellular caspase activity. VEEV is a mosquito-borne pathogen that can affect humans in addition to equine species. VEEV is a mosquito-borne pathogen that can affect humans in addition to equine species. HAdV-5 and -12 have different preferences, with the former relocalizing RI and the latter RII [137,138,139]. Normally, the subcellular localization of PKA is regulated by cellular A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP) during infection, E1A appropriates this role by direct competition with cellular AKAPs and functions as a viral AKAP mimic. the production of type I IFN is triggered by the relocalization of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3, IRF-7, and/or NF-B transcription factors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to activated PRRs. the canonical type I IFN response involves activation of the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways. this triggers translocation of activated STAT proteins hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease is a well-studied protein involved in evading innate immunity. cleavage of Imp-1 reduces nuclear transport of IRF3 and NF-B p65 at early time points during infection, effectively delaying the IFN response. a less direct way of blocking nuclear translocation of cellular proteins involved in innate immune signaling is through simple competition for Imp-. other viruses have evolved similar mechanisms to target importins to evade host innate immunity. this can include sequestering importins in the cytoplasm and even expressing microRNA to downregulate Imp- expression. examples of viruses targeting the protein nuclear export pathway mediated by Crm1 to specifically evade antiviral immunity are less common. cytoplasmic NPCs are being built from newly synthesized Nups. the use of these structures allows cellular proteins with NLSs to shuttle into the MW. cytoplasmic functions for karyopherins and NPCs have been observed with annulate lamellae, a structure composed of stacked endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranes. 2Apro from HRV and PV specifically cleaves the FG-rich region from Nup62. roughly 276 proteins with increased abundance in the cytoplasm were identified. this appeared to be a highly selective re-equilibration of proteins. some of these normally nuclear factors contribute to virus replication. VEEV capsid protein contains both an NLS and NES. the NES is unique in that it strongly binds Crm1 within the cytoplasm in the absence of RanGTP. both the H68 peptide and capsid protein appear to have the same effect on classical nuclear import by blocking transport of cNLS-bearing recombinant proteins. viruses can target different components of the nuclear transport system to cause widespread or selective spatial redistribution of cellar proteins. viruses can alter host nucleocytoplasmic transport or even establish its own transport system, like with HCV. viruses can elicit large proteomic changes that influence cellular dynamics in ways that are beneficial to the viral life cycle and promote infection. NP binds exclusively to the minor NLS-binding site in Imp-. it is plausible that by binding the minor NLS-binding site, NP can compete with cellular bipartite cNLSs for Imp- without influencing the binding of monopartite cNLSs to the major NLS-binding site. it is unknown if VP19C directly interacts with Imp-1. however, it remains possible this NLS functions by piggybacking on other Imp-1 binding proteins. this NLS harbors a small cluster of basic amino acids that are characteristic of a cNLS. linker region led Lange et al. to search for similar cellular bipartite cNLSs. this allowed them to experimentally confirm that Rrp4 had a true bipartite cNLS with a linker of 25 amino acids. this was the case with the HAdV-5 E1A protein, whose C-terminal cNLS was historically described as monopartite. pUL34-GFP fusion proteins predicted two possible cNLSs in this protein. this region indirectly interacts with two representative Imp- family members. amino acids 30\u201369 of E1A were shown to mediate nuclear import. this region indirectly interacts with two different representative Imp- family members. reliance of viruses on nuclear import and export makes it a logical therapeutic target for treating infection. several drugs have been shown to target either nuclear import or export. ivermectin (IVM) is one of the most widely distributed antiparasitic drugs. antiviral function of IVM has shown it is a potent nuclear import inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase as well as DENV-2 NS5 protein. treatment with IVM inhibits infection with all four DENV serotypes. the incidence of DENV infection over the past 50 years has increased 30-fold. / inhibitor has been shown to inhibit adenovirus infection as well as the nuclear import of HIV-1 integrase and the VEEV capsid protein [182]. Currently neither IVM nor mifepristone is approved for treatment of any viral-based infections despite their potential therapeutic benefit. HAdV-5, and HPV-11 protected mice against disease pathology when challenged with IAV [193]. Similarly, verdinexor-treated ferrets had reduced viral burden and lung pathology associated with IAV infection. targeting protein nuclear import or export by repurposing drugs like IVM and Verdinexor could be a viable approach for treating and controlling viral infections."}
