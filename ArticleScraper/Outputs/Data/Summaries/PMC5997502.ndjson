{"summary": "a search algorithm correctly identified large SARI patient cohorts. results between SARI and non-SARI patients were different. further differentiation among critically ill patients may be feasible. data sources included manual review of medical records for validation and development of a gold standard, the Mayo Clinic ICU Data Mart and the Mayo Clinic Advanced Cohort Explorer. patients were eligible if they had been admitted to the medical ICU at our institution from August 2009 through March 2016. the adjudicated outcomes became our gold standard for evaluating the computable phenotypes. our target for performance was sensitivity and specificity of at least 90%. we further compared our computable phenotype to billing data. the Mayo Clinic ICU Data Mart [4] is a repository of all physiologic, laborator and clinical data for ICU admissions at Mayo Clinic. patients were eligible if they had been admitted to the medical ICU at our institution from August 2009 through March 2016. a peak of SARI activity near the peak of flu activity would support the performance of the computable phenotype. two time periods were used: the consecutive 2014 and 2015 nonpandemic influenza seasons and the pandemic 2009 season. subjective fever was defined as a fever at home, during transit, or under other circumstance where the temperature was not directly measured and reported. objective fever achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity with a search of the vital signs flow chart. the billing search had a sensitivity of 73.8% and a specificity of 78.8%. the billing search had a sensitivity of 73.8% and a specificity of 78.8%. 198 patients were admitted to the medical ICU. SARI and patient outcomes From august 2009 through march 2016 a total of 13 689 patients had an index admission in the ICU. of these, 1269 were classified as having SARI. a Detailed discharge status was available for 7766 patients. 4533 did not have SARI and 3233 did. overall, SARI patients tended to be older and sicker and require longer ICU and hospital stays. SARI+ patients received advanced ventilatory support with invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation or with a high-flow nasal cannula. this approach did not improve the AUC for SARI with relation to patient outcomes. hypothermic reported having subjective fever symptoms. more complicated formulations for SARI did not lead to significant improvements in SARI linked to outcomes. our ultimate search strategy for subjective fever was to search the notes for chief complaint, diagnosis and history of present illness. this strategy had 94.7% sensitivity and 94.9% specificity. the search for cough was more challenging because of variable reporting and negation terms in different sections. computable phenotype validation In the validation period, 198 patients were admitted to the medical ICU. of these, 14 were adjudicated as SARI (7.1%). overall, the computable phenotype performed well, with 88.9% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity, outperforming manual searches, which were 57.1% sensitive and 95.9% specificity. a total of 13 689 patients had an index admission in the ICU. of these, 1269 were classified as having SARI. a total of 13 689 patients had an index admission in the ICU. a Detailed discharge status was available for 7766 patients. 4533 did not have SARI and 3233 did. overall, SARI patients tended to be older and sicker and require longer ICU and hospital stays. SARI+ patients received advanced ventilatory support with invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation or with a high-flow nasal cannula. this approach did not improve the AUC for SARI with relation to patient outcomes. a computable phenotype can identify SARI with better accuracy than procedures that use either billing data or manual chart review. a valid computable phenotype for SARI can identify SARI with better accuracy than procedures that use either billing data or manual chart review. despite the increase in ventilator use and length of stay, the ultimate end point of death was no different between SARI patients and non-SARI critically ill patients. many cases of clear clinical SARI (eg, H1N1 influenza virus infection in patients using a ventilator) were missed by the definition. a patient with SARI who requires ventilator care, vasopressors, or other organ support in the first 24 h after admission would likely be part of another tier of outcomes among the critically ill. a potential template for this may come from the European Adaptive Randomised Controlled Trial to Improve Survival in Hospitalised Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Infection. utable phenotype elements may not apply to general medical ward patients or other types of ICU patients. further validation will be needed to apply this search to other groups."}
