{"summary": "swine bone marrow-derived EVs were isolated from swine bone marrow-derived MSCs. incubation of PKH-26-labeled EVs revealed that MSC-EVs incorporated into the epithelial cells. in several animal models of human diseases, MSC-EVs mimic the beneficial effects of MSCs. the anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs was due to transfer of RNAs from EVs to epithelial cells since pre-incubation of MSC-EVs with RNase enzyme abrogated the anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs. intraracheal administration of MSC-EVs after influenza virus infection significantly reduced virus shedding in the nasal swabs, influenza virus replication in the lungs, and virus-induced production of proinflammatory cyto"}
