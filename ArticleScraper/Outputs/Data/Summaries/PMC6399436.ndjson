{"summary": "CHIKV and dengue virus serotype 1 infections were more common in older children, with a complaint of arthralgia serving as a significant predictor for infection with CHIKV. the CHIKV epidemic represents just one of several arboviral agents moving through the population. whole blood was collected in dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes (BD Vacutainer; Becton Dickinson) plasma was extracted and frozen at 70\u00b0C. cytopathic effects were observed in cell monolayers. total RNA extracted from cell\u2013spent media samples were tested by real-time reverse-transcription (RT) PCR. spent medium from cultures displaying non-CHIKV cytopathic effects were screened with a duplex RT-PCR for the viral RNAs of other alphaviruses and flaviviruses. demographic-specific attack rates (ARs) for AFI and for each pathogen were calculated by dividing the number of persons in the specific demographic category with the the clinic at the Christianville School is free and serves as the primary source of medical care for the approximately 1250 children at the 4 school campuses within the Christianville School system. the clinic is free and serves as the primary source of medical care for the approximately 1250 children at the 4 school campuses within the Christianville School system. whole blood was collected in dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes (BD Vacutainer; Becton Dickinson), and plasma was extracted and frozen at 70\u00b0C. all virus isolations and RNA extractions were performed in a biosafety level 3 facility at the University of Florida Emerging Pathogens Institute in Gainesville. if the 95% CIs did not overlap, the categories were considered significantly different. forward and backward stepwise logistic regression models were employed for each pathogen-specific outcome. only the selected variables that were informative (ie, had nonzero, noninfinity point estimates and associated CIs) were included in subsequent analysis. eighty-two children had a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of CHIKV infection. CHIKV infections accounted for virtually all of the May\u2013July AFI cases. major AFI peaks were seen in June 2014, October and November 2014. study population demographics, including age, sex, school location, and grade are presented in Table 1. students in kindergarten had an AR of 39% (95% CI, 33%\u201344%), which was significantly greater than those in primary school students (15%; 12%\u201318%) the mean age for the school-age population was 7.8 years (standard deviation, 4.5) the mean age for the school-age population was 7.8 years (standard deviation, 4.5) the mean age for the school-age population was 8.84 years. 0 (0.0) 0 (.0\u2013.0) 0 (0.0) 0.0 (.0\u2013.0) School C 174 3 (12.5) 0.02 (.0\u2013.04) 8 (25.0) 0.05 (.01\u2013.08) 8 (10.8) 0.02 (.0\u2013.8) 1 (16.7) 0.01 (.0\u2013.2) School D 244 0 (0.0) 0.0 (.0\u2013.0) 2 (6.3) 0.01 (.0\u2013.02) the proportion of positive cases of each pathogen with specific symptoms is presented in Table 3. all children in the study had a history of fever; those with a measured temperature of >37\u00b0C when seen in the clinic were included in the category of \u201cfever at visit\u201d arthralgias in CHIKV-only patients were most common in the knee (48.9%), wrist (44.7%), and ankle (36.2%). no single variable was included in every model. individuals aged 10\u201314 year or older had significantly greater odds of CHIKV infection than 3\u20134-year-olds (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4\u20139.8). aEllipses indicate that the variable was not selected for inclusion in the stepwise model for the outcome of interest. the variables selected for each pathogen model were then used in additional logistic regression models for each outcome that were trained on a randomly selected 66.7% of the data. this process was repeated 100 times, and prediction metrics are presented in Supplementary Table 2. ans cluster analysis for all symptoms with 4 clusters is shown in Supplementary Figure 2. all patients in cluster 1 experienced arthralgia, leg pain, ankle pain, and myalgia. eighteen of the 23 patients grouped into cluster 4 had CHIKV only. arthralgias are seen in CHIKV cases, with knees, wrists, and ankles most commonly affected. age, sex, and arthralgias were predictive of CHIKV infection, with a PPV of 66%. the link with age is not immediately clear, but we hypothesize that it reflects lack of immunity to CHIKV among all population age groups. children who presented to the school clinic with a history of fever and/or had a fever at the time of the clinic visit had blood collected and tested for viral infections. different rates of asymptomatic and subclinical infection for the various pathogens may also have resulted in differential case detection, potentially biasing our results. molecular clock analysis suggests that the 2 clades were introduced into the local population within overlapping time frames [19] there is also a need to link findings with entomologic data. we isolated a new subgroup of African lineage CHIKV from Aedes albopictus in this same area of Haiti."}
