{"summary": "EBOV is the most virulent species of the family with a case mortality of up to 90%. EBOV is the most virulent species of the family with a case mortality of up to 90%. the Reston species is virtually non-pathogenic in humans. tyrosine kinase inhibitors were shown to inhibit lentivirus-based pseudotypes expressing EBOV glycoprotein [10] Gleevec and Tasigna (market names for imatinib mesylate and nilotinib, respectively) the anti-inflammatory immuno-suppressive drug Aimspro (anti-inflammatory immuno-suppressive drug) mimic the properties of antimicrobial peptides, NCK-8 [15,16] and D-LANA-14 [17] have demonstrated potent activity against EBOV. they were expected to be active against EBOV Celgosivir and its prodrug castanospermine. stock solutions of these compounds were made at double the final dilution. the highest concentration of DMSO was 0.05%, except for omeprazole and esomeprazole. the outer wells were left with media added. RNA was eluted in 60 L nuclease-free water. target amplification was performed using primers to Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein. analysis was performed using the ABi 7500. ing assays were repeated to assess for effects against EBOV using MRC-5 cells. compounds were tested in dilutions shown not to exert a cytotoxic effect on uninfected MRC-5 cells. a 10 higher viral inoculum was used; samples were harvested after two days. a negative control group consisted of guinea pigs that were EBOV challenged. each day, animals were individually weighed and their temperatures were recorded by a subcutaneously-inserted temperature/identification chip. humane clinical endpoints were used, which standardized when animals would be culled using a UK home office approved Schedule 1 method. the highest concentration of DMSO was 0.05%, except for omeprazole and esomeprazole. media were removed from the inner wells of 96-well plates. the outer wells were left with media added. target amplification was performed using primers to Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein. analysis was performed using the ABi 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, UK) analysis was performed using the ABi 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, UK) a 10 higher viral inoculum was used (approximately 5000 TCID50/well); and (iii) samples were harvested after two days. MRC-5 cells were chosen as a host-matched human cell line susceptible to EBOV infection [6] and VeroE6 for being widely used in EBOV studies. supernatants from MRC-5 and VeroE6 cells were harvested on days 3 and 6 post-infection. cells were microscopically assessed for the condition of the monolayer. amplification was performed using the ABi 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, UK) dilutions were made and incubated on MRC-5 cells for three days. cells were visually assessed for cytotoxicity, and monolayers were fixed with formaldehyde solution before staining with crystal violet for a gross visual inspection of cell attachment. treatment was initiated with the compounds BGB324, NCK-8 and 17-DMAG. the compounds were dissolved in 0.5% (w/w) hydroxypropyl methylcellulose/0.1% (w/w) Tween-80 to give a concentration that equated to 100 mg/kg in 1 mL. the assessment was based on Technical Readiness Level (TRL), availability and previous evidence of efficacy against EBOV. companies and institutions who had suggested the compounds were asked to score their drugs themselves. a scientific panel identified eighteen compounds suitable for screening. cytopathic effects (CPEs) were assessed to give a readout of viral replication. results identified nine compounds that had no reduction in viral replication despite cells remaining healthy. these compounds were removed from further evaluation. 3.93 0.25 Abacavir sulphate 5 M 1.54 3.26 3.95 2.69 Entecavir 5 M 3.08 0.20 4.44 1.11 JB1a 2 g/mL 4.02 0.13 5.48 0.50 Omeprazole 100 M 1.35 1.35 x 2.21 1.08 x Esomeprazole magnesium 75 M 1.05 0.79 x 1.62 0.36 x Gleevec 20 M 3.60 0.63 x 3.49 0.54 x A similar responses were observed between MRC-5 and veroE6 cells. a higher concentration of virus inoculum and incubation for two days. the concentrations used were adjusted to determine the optimum concentration that caused tolerable toxicity after incubation. 0.19 20 g/mL 0.37 0.11 6.7 g/mL 0.40 0.32 1 Difference between the mean value of untreated cells (n = 3) versus treated cells (n = 3). positive value indicates a reduction in viral RNA levels. testing of NCK-8 in EBOV-infected Guinea Pigs NCK-8 was delivered intravenously with two doses per day starting at 6 h post-challenge. an animal in the NCK-8-treated group began to increase its weight nine days post-challenge. this animal survived to the scheduled end of the study. a scientific panel identified eighteen compounds that were suitable for EBOV screening (Table 1). a scientific panel identified eighteen compounds that were suitable for screening (Table 1).
