{"summary": "a novel human enterovirus (HEV) type within the species HEV-C, named EV109, was discovered from cases of respiratory illness in 2010. the aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the presence and role of EV109 in respiratory samples from two patients populations. a total of 1149 nasopharingeal aspirates were collected and tested for the presence of EV109 by reverse transcription-PCR. more than 100 different serotypes of non polio enteroviruses have been recognized. two new enteroviruses, the HEV104 and the HEV109, classified within HEV species C, were reported in association with respiratory diseases. the global distribution of HEV109 is currently unknown and no studies have been performed yet. nasopharyngeal aspirates were evaluated from 974 infants hospitalised from October 2004 to November 2010. nasopharyngeal aspirates were evaluated for the presence of HEV109. the two HEV109 positive children were 3 and 6 months old. 322 evaluations of this epidemic period, the prevalence of HEV109 resulted 0.6%. the virus circulated during the RSV epidemic peak contemporarily with hMPV and hCoV. only one out of the 175 samples tested positive for HEV109 infection. the low number of HEV109 positive samples could not allow a reliable statistical analysis of the severity of the infection or co-infection. the three identified HEV109 strains resulted almost identical (less than 1% nucleotide difference), while the three identified HEV109 strains resulted almost identical (less than 1% nucleotide difference) the new enterovirus may cause sporadic epidemics in northern Italy. the sequence analysis performed on 950 bases along the UTR, the VP4 and VP2 regions showed only a few differences in the nucleotide sequence of our strains compared with the Nicaragua strains. some results may point towards a possible role of this virus as co-pathogen in ARDs in infants. a total of 974 archived nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from children 24 months old and hospitalized for ARDs were examined in the present study. only 16 out of 54 transplant patients suffered sporadic episodes of upper respiratory symptoms. the role of this new HEV needs to be clearly elucidated. a total of 175 archived NPAs were obtained from 50 allogeneic and 4 autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient patients. a total of 175 archived NPAs were obtained from 50 allogeneic and 4 autologous stem cell transplant recipients. cloning each amplified target regions into pCR2.1 plasmid vector (TA Cloning Kit; Invitrogen), serially diluted from 106 copies to 1 copy as previously described. amplification protocols ensured the detection of 5 and 15 DNA copies/reaction of HEV109 target regions respectively. after agarose gel electrophoresis visualization, all the amplification products were sequenced bidirectionally to confirm amplification specificity. 5 l of first RT-PCR reaction underwent a semi-nested amplification using the Platinum TaqDNA Polimerase (Invitrogen) primers were used at a final concentration of 200 nM. amplification specificity was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic internal control. in all amplification protocols primers were used at a final concentration of 200 nM. an additional 390 bp band was always present that when sequenced independently corresponded to the HEV109 genome amplified with the outer primers. the inner amplification product corresponded to the HEV only when sequenced."}
