{"summary": "over 28,000 individuals were infected, over 11,000 died, and there are currently an estimated 16,000 survivors. many survivors are now suffering sequelae that arose after they recovered from their EBOV infections. EBOV has been shown to persist in semen for six months, EBOV RNA has been found in semen as late as nine months post-infection. clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that is used to treat female infertility due to anovulation. it was also proposed in 1991 as a drug to reverse impotence in men due to low testosterone levels. however, clomiphene likely exerts its anti-EBOV activity because it is a cationic amphiphilic drug [29] that accumulates in endolysosomes. enclomiphene is currently in clinical development as a treatment for secondary hypogonadism. enclomiphene, enclomiphene, zuclomiphene, and two of their primary metabolites block EBOV entry and replication to similar levels. enclomiphene, enclomiphene, and zuclomiphene displayed similar dose profiles for blocking EBOV entry and replication to similar levels. HEK 293T/17 and Vero E6 cells contained either 10% supplemented calf serum (SCS; Hyclone, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Seradigm, University of Virginia Tissue Culture Facility, Charlottesville, VA, USA) p1 and p2 stocks prepared by serial passaging of p0 stocks on HEK 293T/17 target cells freshly transfected with pCAGGS-NP, pCAGGS-VP35, pCAGGS-VP30, pCAGGS-L, and pCAGGS-Tim1. trVLPs (p0, p1, and p2) were stored on ice and used within two weeks. entry-reporter VLP preparations were assessed by western blot analyses. all entry-reporter VLP preparations were frozen in single use aliquots at 80 \u00b0C. trVLP infection and parallel cell viability assays were assayed. pretreatment solution was removed and replaced with 25 L or 50 L trVLPs diluted to 200 L in growth medium containing 10% SCS and the indicated concentration(s) of the indicated drug(s) (DMSO for mock) cells were then incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator, after which the medium was replaced with 40 L of fresh growth medium containing 10% SCS. 25\u201350,000 Vero E6 or 293T/17 cells were seeded per well of a clear 96-well plate. at 18\u201324 h post seeding, the cells were treated with the indicated drug(s) at the indicated concentration(s) (DMSO for mock) were bound to the cells by spinfection (250 g) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. the cells were then incubated for 3 h in a 37 the plate was placed on a Jitterbug orbital shaker (575 rpm) for 2 min at RT. the luminescent signal was detected using a HT plate reader. GraphPad Prism 7.0 was used to perform non-linear regression analyses. HEK 293T/17 and Vero E6 cells contained either 10% supplemented calf serum (SCS; Hyclone, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Seradigm, University of Virginia Tissue Culture Facility, Charlottesville, VA, USA) p0 stocks were prepared by serial passaging of p0 stocks on HEK 293T/17. target cells freshly transfected with pCAGGS-NP, pCAGGS-VP35, pCAGGS-VP30, pCAGGS-L, and pCAGGS-Tim1 were stored on ice and used within two weeks. 80% confluent HEK 293T/17 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding EBOV or MARV GP, VP40, mCherry-VP40, and entry-reporter VLPs were frozen in single use aliquots at 80 \u00b0C. trVLPs were assayed as described [42,43] with minor modifications. target cells were seeded in opaque white 96-well plates to assess cell density and transfection efficacy. pretreatment solution was removed and replaced with 25 L or 50 L trVLPs diluted to 200 L in growth medium containing 10% SCS. the cells were then incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. 40 L of RenillaGlo substrate (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was then added to each well and the plate was immediately analyzed on a GloMax plate reader. 25\u201350,000 vero E6 or 293T/17 cells were seeded per well of a clear 96-well plate. at 18\u201324 h post seeding, the cells were treated with the indicated drug(s) at the indicated concentration(s) (DMSO for mock) were bound to the cells by spinfection (250 g) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. cells were then incubated for 3 h in a 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator GraphPad Prism 7.0 was used to perform non-linear regression analyses. inhibitory concentration, 50% (IC50) and 90% (IC90) values were interpolated. at a dose of 5 M, all five forms of clomiphene showed approximately equal potency, reducing the trVLP signal by approximately 1000-fold. parallel sets of cells showed no evidence of cytotoxicity by any form of clomiphene. parallel HEK293T/17 cells were treated as in (A) but mock infected with 25 L medium instead of trVLPs. trVLP infection was significantly inhibited by all concentrations of drugs tested. vero E6 cells were treated with 5 M clomiphene (Clo), enclomiphene (En), zuclomiphene (Zu), 4-hydroxy-enclomiphene (4-OH En), 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene (4-OH Zu), or DMSO (mock, M) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. we first compared clomiphene, enclomiphene, and zuclomiphene in the trVLP infection and VLP entry systems using eight-point dose response curves. similar results were seen when comparing eight doses of clomiphene and enclomiphene in trVLP infection and VLP entry. HEK293T/17 cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of clomiphene or enclomiphene (serial two-fold dilutions from 10 M) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. cytoplasmic entry was assayed as described in the legend to Figure 2. drug assay Set 1 Set 2 IC50 (M) IC90 (M) IC50 (M) IC90 (M) IC90 (M) Clomiphene trVLP 1.2 1.4 0.9 2.2 Entry 1.4 4.1 2.9 4.4 * Enclomiphene trVLP 1.0 2.8 Entry 1.2 1.6 Zuclomiphene trVLP 1.2 1.4 Entry 2.2 5.6 Set 2 values are from experiments that compared c clomiphene blocks infections in multiple cell types including vero E6 (kidney), HepG2 (liver) and HUVEC (endothelial) cells. trVLP experiments were conducted in HEK 293T/17 cells. clomiphene and enclomiphene blocked trVLP infection in vero E6 cells. the current trVLP system uses plasmids encoding proteins from the mayinga (1976) isolate of EBOV. enclomiphene exerted a similar effect as clomiphene in blocking entry mediated by a marburg virus GP. cytoplasmic entry was assayed and analyzed as described for Figure 2. data SD were normalized to the average % entry for mock treated cells incubated with the same VLP type. parallel sets of cells showed no evidence of cytotoxicity by any form of clomiphene. HEK293T/17 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the EBOV polymerase (EBOV L) and EBOV nucleoprotein (NP), EBOV VP30, EBOV VP35, and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (Tim1). trVLP infection was significantly inhibited by all concentrations of all drugs tested. clomiphene blocks EBOV infection by blocking entry of viral particles into the cell cytoplasm [20,29,32] vero E6 cells were treated with 5 M clomiphene (Clo), enclomiphene (En), zuclomiphene (Zu), 4-hydroxy-enclomiphene (4-OH En), 4-hydroxy-zuclomiphene (4-OH Zu), or DMSO (mock, M) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. similar results were observed in two additional experiments. we first compared clomiphene, enclomiphene, and zuclomiphene in the trVLP infection and VLP entry systems using eight-point dose response curves. as seen in Figure 3, clomiphene and enclomiphene showed similar dose-dependent inhibition of trVLP infection. HEK293T/17 cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of clomiphene or enclomiphene for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. VLPs bearing EBOV GP were then bound to the cells in the presence of the indicated concentration of drug and cytoplasmic entry was assayed as described in the legend to Figure 2.
