{"summary": "ribosomal frameshift (PRF) is a non-conventional translation phenomenon. it pertains to a particular change in the reading frame of the messenger RNA (mRNA) induced by a stimulatory signal. the stimulatory signal controls the -1 PRF efficiency by making the ribosome pause over the slippery sequence (11\u201313) peptidyl-tRNA (pept-tRNA) and aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) are bound to the XXY and YYZ codons. the ribosome shift towards the 5' direction and re-pair to the mRNA in the new reading frame. the aa-tRNA is not supported by structure analysis and molecular dynamics. a second model was proposed by weiss et al. (26), where -1 PRF occurs during the translocational step of the elongation cycle. -1 PRF can be affected by mutations in the small subunit rRNA that alter the accommodation of the aa-tRNA in the A/A site (35) and by mutations in the elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) (36,37), the eukaryotic homologue of EF-Tu, that contributes to the accommodation process. this model proposes that the -1 PRF occurs when aa-tRNA and pept-tRNA are located the -1 PRF occurs when the pept-tRNA and the aa-tRNA occupy, respectively, the P/E and the A/P sites, prior to peptide bond formation. the relative position of the subunits is modified (ratchet-like rotation) compared to their position after peptide bond formation. the upper stem\u2013loop is at a distance of eight nucleotides from this slippery sequence. it allows the -1 PRF to occur, involving the tRNAs interacting with the P- and A-site codons. mutations in the E-site codon can alter the -1 PRF efficiency. Plasmids contain the HIV-1 frameshift region inserted between the coding sequence of the Rluc (white) and the Fluc (grey) genes. the fluc coding sequence is in the -1 reading frame with the Rluc initiator codon. the -1 PRF efficiency of each (\u20131) construct is obtained by dividing the Fluc/Rluc ratio by the corresponding ratio of the (0) frame construct. the mutated DNA was subcloned into pDual-HIV (\u20131) previously digested by KpnI and Pfl23II restriction enzymes. the mutated DNA was subcloned into pDual-HIV (\u20131). -1 PRF efficiencies obtained from dual-luciferase activities with pDual-HIV derivatives in 293T mammalian cultured cells. values are the means of at least four independent experiments, with the bars representing the standard error on the means. -1 PRF efficiencies were measured from GFP/RFP and dual-luciferase assays. efficiencies are expressed as a percent of wild-type (WT) 16S rRNA activity. -1 PRF efficiencies are the means of at least three independent experiments. mutants iG666 and C739 were introduced in the 16S rRNA by amplification of the mutated DNA fragments from p3RGFP-HIV (\u20131). resultant PCR fragment was subcloned into p3RGFP-HIV (\u20131) previously digested with the same enzymes. the 16S rRNA mutations in p3RGFP-HIV (\u20131) were cloned in pDual-HIV/P (0) and (\u20131) using two ApaI restriction sites. a BamHI\u2013SacI fragment encompassing 16S rRNA from p3RGFP-HIV (\u20131) was cloned into pUC18 digested with the same enzymes. the 16S rRNA library from pUC18/R16S was cloned into p3RGFP-HIV. each isolated 16S rRNA mutation was re-introduced into p3RGFP-HIV. each isolated 16S rRNA mutation was re-introduced into p3RGFP-HIV. overnight cultures of E. coli Top 10 strain (Invitrogen) were transformed with pDual-HIV/P or p3RGFP-HIV derivatives. the cultures were diluted to an absorbance of 0.1 at 600 nm. the cultures were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. pDual-HIV (\u20131) and (0) plasmids used in frameshift assays in mammalian cultured cells are derivatives of pDual-HIV (\u20131) and (0) plasmids described in Dulude et al. (18). the pDual-HIV plasmid contains the HIV-1 group M subtype B frameshift region inserted between the sequences coding for Rluc and Fluc. -1 PRF efficiencies of the M1 to M7 mutant constructs are indicated relative to wild-type (WT, shown in light grey) set arbitrarily at 100%. -1 PRF efficiencies were obtained from dual-luciferase activities with pDual-HIV derivatives in 293T mammalian cultured cells. -1 PRF efficiencies obtained from dual-luciferase activities with pDual-HIV derivatives in 293T mammalian cultured cells. the efficiencies are indicated relative to HIV-1 wild-type frameshift region. values are the means of at least four independent experiments. the pGFPemd-N1 plasmid coding sequence was obtained from the pGFPemd-N1 plasmid, a kind gift from Dr B.S. Glick, from the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. the coding sequence was obtained from the pGFPemd-N1 plasmid, a kind gift from Dr M. Bouvier, from the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. the resultant PCR fragments were subcloned into the pRNAluc2 plasmid digested with NsiI and Pfl23II. the pRNAluc2 plasmid contains the E. coli rrnB operon under the control of the inducible lacUV5 promoter. as in the GFP/RFP system, the RBS of the dual-luciferase reporter and the MBS of the 16S rRNA mutator strain (Stratagene) was used to produce random mutations into 16S rRNA. the procedure was repeated seven times, so that more than 90% of the clones analysed contained a mutation in the 16S rRNA fragment. each isolated 16S rRNA mutation was re-introduced into p3RGFP-HIV (\u20131). cells were cultured for 48 h before being washed twice with 2 ml of PBS. lysed with 450 l of the Cell Passive Lysis Buffer 1X (Promega) fluorescence was measured with a Fusion Universal Microplate Analyser (FusionTM -FP, Packard) at a 485 nm excitation wavelength (bandpass: 20 nm) for both GFP and RFP and at a 535 nm (bandpass: 25 nm) and 580 nm (bandpass: 15 nm) emission wavelength for GFP and RFP. mutations within the eight nucleotides immediately preceding the slippery sequence nucleotides A BC are positioned so that the BCX and the ABC codons are located in the E site before and after the shift. we used a dual-luciferase reporter system (18) in mammalian cultured cells. in this system, the frameshift region is positioned between Rluc and Fluc coding sequences, such that Fluc expression requires the \u20131 PRF of HIV-1. the -1 PRF efficiency was increased by about 50%. with M3, the -1 PRF efficiency decreased slightly to 70% of the wild-type value, while the frameshift level remained unchanged with M4. mutations in positions A BC, immediately upstream of the classic slippery sequence, can noticeably affect the -1 PRF efficiency of HIV-1. the C1, C3 and C5 constructs contain the extended slippery sequences found, respectively, in giardia virus (C AUC CCU UUA), eIAV (U CCA AAA AAC) and in SARS-CoV (G UUU UUA AAC) the -1 PRF efficiencies obtained with these three constructs vary between 4% and 5%, about 40\u201360% of the HIV-1 -1 PRF efficiency. identification of 16S rRNA mutations that affect -1 PRF. rRNA mutations found to influence -1 PRF perturb the accommodation process. rRNA mutations found to influence -1 PRF disrupt the accommodation process. mutant G666 with a guanosine deleted from the stretch of guanosines between positions 666 to 671, mutant iC739 with a cytosine inserted into the stretch of cytosines between positions 735 to 739. mutant iC739 with a cytosine inserted into the stretch of cytosines between positions 735 to 739, and mutant iC739 with a cytosine replaced by an aden iG666 and iC739 mutants are located in either strand of the same 16S rRNA helix. the iC739 mutation increased -1 PRF efficiency with the other frameshift regions to about 150% compared to wild-type 16S rRNA. this could cause a drop-off of the short peptide resulting from the -1 PRF. helices 21 and 22 are part of the central domain of the 16S rRNA. the 16S rRNA mutations within helices 21 (G604A) and 22 (G666, iC739 and C739) that affect -1 PRF are boxed. the mutations are represented in spaced filling and in red. the XXY and YYZ codons of the classic slippery sequence are located in the P and A sites, respectively, when the -1 PRF occurs. the XXY and YYZ codons of the classic slippery sequence (X XXY YYZ) are located in the P and A sites, respectively, when the -1 PRF occurs. the absolute value of the WT -1 PRF efficiency was 8.0 1.0%. in Figure 3B, a value of 100% is arbitrarily assigned to this efficiency. mutations upstream the A BC nucleotides did not alter the -1 PRF efficiency. nucleotides found at positions A BC could be involved in -1 PRF of HIV-1. this was not the case for the nucleotides upstream of A BC. -1 PRF efficiencies with other viral frameshift regions mutated at positions A BC. exchanging slippery sequences from different frameshift regions alters the -1 PRF efficiency (18,50) but only the heptanucleotide slippery sequence was exchanged. -1 PRF efficiency drops to 20\u201330% when the classic slippery sequence is replaced with the classic slippery sequence found in giardia virus, EIAV or in SARS-CoV. a pool of randomly mutated plasmids was obtained, where 90% of the clones analysed contained a mutation in the 16S rRNA random library. the 16S rRNA random library was then cloned into a plasmid containing reporter genes coding for RFP and GFP. a small screen was individually performed (about 2000 clones), using the GFP/RFP assay to select clones for which GFP expression was affected. d-encoded 16S rRNA mutants were introduced in this vector. with mutants G604A and iC739, the -1 PRF efficiency was increased to 170%. however, the -1 PRF efficiency was also increased to 150% with mutant G666, despite the fact that it decreased in the GFP/RFP assay. the iC739 mutation was investigated with the C5 construct that contains the extended slippery sequence found in SARS-CoV and the C6 chimeric construct. the classic slippery sequence of HIV-1 is replaced with the one found in SARS-CoV, while the A BC nucleotides correspond to those found in HIV-1. the locations of the mutations that were selected from the random library are shown in the secondary and tertiary structure of the 16S rRNA. coli 16S rRNA tertiary structure is represented in spaced filling and in red. the 16S rRNA mutations are represented in spaced filling and in red. mutating the BCX codon plus the preceding base (A) immediately upstream of HIV-1 classic heptanucleotide slippery sequence changes the -1 PRF efficiency. ency virus type 1 G GCU AAU UUU UUA Simian immunodeficiency virus type 2 G GCA AAU UUU UUA Rous sarcoma virus C UUG ACA AAU UUA

BC are in italics. mutations located in helix 22 are close to nucleotides from the 690 and 790 loops that contact the anticodon stem of the tRNA at the E site. these interactions require kink-turn motifs that are maintained by the coaxial helices 21 and 22. the mutations that alter the -1 PRF efficiency could be related to the site. the sequence of events that lead to -1 PRF starts when the BCX and XXY codons (AAU UUU in HIV-1 frameshift region) occupy respectively, the P and A sites. translocation begins after the binding of EF-G (or eEF2) associated to a GTP molecule to the ribosome. the acceptor stems of the tRNAs move towards the E and P sites. the incoming aa-tRNA occupies an entry site (A*/T*) because of the incomplete translocation, the incoming aa-tRNA occupies an entry site (A*/T*) that differs from the standard A/T entry site. the driving force for the change in the reading frame is therefore the tendency of the tRNAs to occupy their standard binding sites. a translocation anomaly leading to -1 PRF occurs when the XXY and YYZ codons occupy the P and A sites. we suggest that a translocation anomaly leading to -1 PRF occurs at the preceding elongation cycle. the ribosome selects an incoming aa-tRNA in an A*/T* site. the tRNAs in the E*/E*, P*/P* and A*/P* sites unpair from the mRNA. the deac-tRNA is ejected from the ribosome upon occupancy of the A/A site. standard base-pairing is possible between the tRNA and the ABC nucleotides. a major consequence of mutating the BCX codon plus the preceding base is not likely to alter the -1 PRF efficiency. we propose that the main consequence of making these changes is to modify the identity of the E-site tRNA."}
