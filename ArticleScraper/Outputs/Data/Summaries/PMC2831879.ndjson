{"summary": "SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus with 30 kb genome. some of these ORFs encode proteins homologue to structural proteins founded in other coronaviruses. accessory proteins are not necessary for viral replication in cell culture systems and in mice. the 7a protein appears to have diverse biological functions in cultured cells. over-expression of ORF 7a induces apoptosis via the caspase-dependent pathway. it inhibits cellular protein synthesis by activating p38 MAPK. the intracellular level of \"allarmone\" nucleotide Ap4A has been shown to increase in cells after heat, oxidative, nutritional or DNA damage stresses. a recent study showed that Ap4A-hydrolase belongs to the transcriptional regulation network in immunologically activated mast cells. the transfected cells were lysed 24-48 h after transfection. protein extracts were immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-V5 antibody. antibody-antigen complexes were immobilized on protein A and G-sepharose bead mixture. samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with monoclonal anti-HA antibodies. no consensus opinion in subcellular localization of 7a protein [for review see [11]] 7a protein was found co-locolaze with trans-Golgi marker, Golgin97 [9], in the Golgi compartment [14]. a yeast two-hybrid screening performed in pYESTrp2 (Invitrogen). 35 clones were able to grow in selective media (-Trp, -Leu, -His) and gave a strong signal when analyzed for -galactosidase activity. antibody-antigen complexes were immobilized on protein A and G-sepharose bead mixture. the immobilized proteins were eluted by boiling beads in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. the samples were subsequently analyzed by Western blot using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. 7a protein was found co-locolaze with trans-Golgi marker, Golgin97 [9], in the Golgi compartment [14]. other reports showed co-localization with endoplasmic reticulum marker GRP94 or the intermediate compartment marker Sec 31 [7,17] study of interactions between viral and cellular proteins may help to elucidate molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV pathogenicity. interaction between 7a protein and Ap4A-hydrolase was initially found in the yeast two-hybrid system and then confirmed in human cells. over-expression of 7a protein in cultured cells induces apoptosis via increasing level of caspase-3 protease activity. this could be achieved by up-regulation of the amino-acyl-tRNA synthetases. this would result in an increase of Ap4A level and contribute to the induction of apoptosis. some SARS-CoV proteins, including nucleocapsid N [37], 3b [38] and 7a [15] block cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phase. inhibition of Rb phosphorylation by 7a suggests that the expression of G1 cyclin/cdk complexes is suppressed. plasmid pXJ3'-ORF7a-HA containing full-length SARS-CoV ORF 7a with C-terminal HA-tag was a generous gift from Dr. Yee-Joo Tan. the gene was amplified from the plasmid pH5L-ORF7a using primers 5'-GGGGTACCATGAAAATTATTCTCT-3' and 5'-CGCTCGAGTTATGGATAATCTAACTCC pH5L-ORF7a was digested with EcoR I and Xho I sites of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Mountain View, USA) resulting in pEGFP-C2-ORF7a where ORF 7a was fused to the C-terminus of EGFP. the plasmid containing the human full-length Ap4A-hydrolase gene was recovered from the yeast clone. the full-length cDNA of ORF 7a was cloned into pHybLex/Zeo to create a \"bait\" gene construct. the plasmid pHybLex/Zeo-ORF7a was used as a source of \"prey\" genes. positive clones were selected for growth in the absence of uracil, leucine, histidine and tryptophane. Western-blot and confocal microscopic analysis screened expression of proteins 48 h after transfection. HEK293 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% deoxicholate Na, 0.1% SDS and 1 mM PMSF) cell lysates were prepared in IP-lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1% Nonident-40) cells were co-transfected with 3 g pXJ3'-ORF7a-HA and 3 g pcDNA3.1/V5-His-Ap4A. plasmid pXJ3'-ORF7a-HA containing full-length SARS-CoV ORF 7a with C-terminal HA-tag was a generous gift from Dr. Yee-Joo Tan. the gene was amplified from RNA of SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells (strain Tor 2) using a one step RT PCR kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) and clo plasmid containing the human full-length Ap4A-hydrolase gene was recovered from the yeast clone as described below. the gene was amplified by PCR using the specific primers 5'-GCGGATCCAGATGGCCTTGAGAGCATG-3' and 5'-CGCTCGAGCTCTCTCTATGGAGCAAAGA-3' and subcloned into the Hind III and EcoR I sites of pDsRed2 (Cl plasmid pHybLex/Zeo-ORF7a was used to transform yeast strain EGY48/pSH18-34. plasmid pHybLex/Zeo-ORF7a was used as a source of \"prey\" genes. positive clones were selected for growth in absence of uracil, leucine, histidine and tryptophane. monoclonal mouse anti-HA Tag antibody (Upstate, Temecula, USA), dilution 1:5000; monoclonal mouse anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada), dilution 1:2000; goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugated IgG.
