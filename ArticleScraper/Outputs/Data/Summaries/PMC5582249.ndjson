{"summary": "multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) the main cause of the MS is yet to be revealed, but the most probable theory is based on the molecular mimicry that concludes some infections in the activation of T cells against brain auto-antigens. esize all PLP fragments and examine their immunogenicity experimentally (in vitro) the best encephalitogenic antigens were predicted based on bioinformatics tools that may provide reliable results for researches in shorter time and at a lower cost. the protein has been isolated by Folch and Lees in 1951. it is able to induce autoimmune encephalomyelitis experimentally in the rodents and non-human primates. if the best PLP epitopes and significant similarity between these epitopes and some microbial epitopes could be found, molecular mimicry hypothesis could be proven. however, there isn\u2019t a systemic method available for PLP epitope prediction as yet (29,30) phyre2 server (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi\"id=index) combines learning machine methods, evolutionary information and fragment libraries to predict protein tertiary structures and structural features. a new tab a: Abbreviations; Mol.

IEDB (Immune-Epitope Database) server provides access to a reliable prediction of peptides binding to specific MHC molecules. some of the most frequent alleles were used for developing T cell epitope prediction. IEDB (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/), BCPred (http://ailab.ist.psu.edu/bcpred/predict.html) and ABCPred (www.imtech.res.in/raghava/abcpred) were used to select the most effective epitopes. PLP with an alternative name of Lipophilin plays a vital role in the formation or maintenance of the multilamellar structure of myelin. this protein is a hydrophobic integral membrane protein containing four transmembrane regions, one cytoplasmic, and two extracellular loops. the post translational modifications of the protein are lipidation in amino acids. negative R-groups are more frequent than positive R-groups. energy minimization (E= -2432.302) and loop refinement were done. reliability of the model by Ramachandran plot was 98.4%. table 2 includes peptides with higher affinities (low ranks) for the corresponding alleles. results were arranged in their corresponding boxes based on peptides with higher scores. 76-90, 249-263, 245-259 HLA-DRB1*15 ProPred 78-86, 173-181, 250-258, 69-77, 163-171 HLA-DRB1*0401 HLAPred 79-87, 70-78, 177-185, 58-66, 245-53, 251-259, 161-169 HLADRB1*0401 IEDB 251-265, 252-266, 253-267, 69-83, 67-81, 75-89, 70-84, 81-95, 66-80, 239-253 DQA1*05:01/DQB1*0201 IEDB 76-90, 77-91, 75-89, 74-88, 78-92, 73-87, 79-93, 155-169, 154-168, 239-253, 238-252, 240-254, 161-175, A1* 58-74, AA161-177, and AA238-254) were predicted to be immunogenic regions. only one amino acid in each position is an indicator for the most conserved sequence. the epitope region is recognized by the minimum number of fragments and the maximum properties for selection of an epitope function. s in the bacterial kingdom with more than 50% similarity to the candidate epitope, AA58-74 (YEYLINVIHAFQYVIYG) showed a similar peptide in the bacteria that mostly are consisted of the clostridia and mycobacteria.
