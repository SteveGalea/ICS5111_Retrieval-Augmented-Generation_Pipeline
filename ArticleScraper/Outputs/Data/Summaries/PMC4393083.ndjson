{"summary": "human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most common cause of upper respiratory tract infection (or common cold) they are also associated with more severe diseases such as acute otitis media in children [3] and sinusitis in adults [4]. HRVs can also cause severe lower respiratory tract symptoms such as pneumonia, wheezing, bronchiolitis, and exacerbations of asthma. the aim of the study was to assess the cytotoxic and antiviral effects on two cell lines (HeLa and MRC5) and two HRV serotypes (HRV-2 and HRV-4) of paeonol (PA), gallic acid (GA) and 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl--D-glucopyranose (PGG) were compared with those of ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent Merck silica gel plates (Kieselgel 60 F254) were used for analytical thin-layer chromatography. materials Ribavirin (>98% purity) and MTT were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan) and Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), respectively. human rhinovirus serotypes HeLa (ATCC CCL\u20132), a human epithelial adenocarcinoma cervix cell line, and MRC5 (ATCC CCl-171) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) these cell lines were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotic-antimycotic solution (100 mg/L of streptomycin, and 250 g/L of amphotericin) active fraction EI was rechromatographed on a silica gel column (550 g) by elution with chloroform and methanol (70:30 by volume) to give nine fractions (each about 450 mL) column fractions were monitored by TLC on silica gel plates developed with chloroform and methanol. compound 1 was isolated as an antibacterial principle from P. lactiflora root in our previous work [17], and the spectral data of compound 3 was largely identical to the published data [17,20]. spectral data of compound 1 was largely identical to the published data [17,20]. 5% CL) SI Methanol extract >1000 113.5 (242.3\u2013266.3) 70.2 (66.7\u201373.8) 3.6 Chloroform-SF 136.0 (125.4\u2013157.6) ND Ethyl acetate-SF 552.9 (504.1\u2013606.5) 121.5 (117.1\u2013125.9) 4.6 Butanol-SF >1000 >1000 Water-SF >1000 >1000 CC50, 50% cytotoxic concentration; IC50, 50% inhibitory concentration; SI, select a volume of 100 L medium containing 0.05% MTT was added to each well. the plate was shaken for 15 min to dissolve the purple formazan crystals that had formed. a DMSO solution was then added to each well. MRC5 cells were seeded at 105 cells/mL in a 6-well plate. monolayers were treated with 100 g/mL PA or 20 g/mL PGG. untreated cultures were included in the assay. unbound virus was removed by washing the wells with PBS twice. cells were incubated in fresh medium supplemented with or without test compounds. after 2 days, MTT test and antiviral activity were carried out as stated previously. qRT-PCR was performed in 96-well plates using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System. each reaction mixture consisted of 10 L of Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (2). mRNA expression level of target gene was normalized to mRNA expression level for the housekeeping gene B2M. gene RefSeq ID Forward primer and Reverse primer cDNA amplicon size B2M AF072097 CTCCGTGGCCTTAGCTGTG TTTGGATAGCCT 68 ICAM-1 NM_000201.2 ACCTCCCCACCCACATTT 96 LDLR NM_000527 CTGGAAATTGCGCTGGAC CGCAGACCCACTTGTAGGAG 125 IL-6 M14584 GACCCAACCACAAATGCCA GTCATG ilulted 500, 2000, and 1000 times for anti-ICAM-1, anti-LDLR, and anti-actin antibodies. ten micrograms of cell lysates from different treatments were mixed with an equal volume of 5 Laemmli sample buffer, boiled in 10 min, and resolved by electrophoresis in 11% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. differences in protein expressions were quantified using a Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and normalized to actin expression on the same membrane. concentrations of soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) in cell-free culture supernatants 2 days after treatment were measured using a sICAM-1 ELISA kit. the IC50 values for each serotype and their treatments were considered significantly different from one another when their 95% confidence limits did not overlap. the selectivity index (SI) was determined as the ratio of CC50 to IC50 [23]. Agilent 1200 series high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) were used for isolation of active principles. materials Ribavirin (>98% purity) and MTT were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan) and Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) the hexane-soluble fraction was most biologically active (Table 1) and was chromatographed as described previously. the other active ethyl acetate-soluble fraction (8 g) was chromatographed on a 55 5 cm silica gel column (550 g) by elution. the active fraction EI was rechromatographed on a silica gel column by elution with chloroform and methanol (70:30 by volume) to give nine fractions (each about 450 mL) a preparative HPLC was used for separation of constituents from the active fractions 3 to 5 (0.176 g) compound 3 was isolated as an antibacterial principle from P. lactiflora root in our previous work [17], and the spectral data of compound 3 was largely identical to the published data [17,20]. ol, gallic acid (2), and 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl--D-glucopyranose (3) were identified in Paeonia lactiflora root in this study. the chemical formulae of these compounds are C9H10O3, C7H6O5, and C41H32O26; the molar masses are 166.18, 170.12, and 940.67 g/mol. monolayers of MRC5 cells were seeded onto a 96-well culture plate. after 24 h, the cells were treated with 100 g/mL PA or 20 g/mL PGG. after 48 h incubation, the cultures were frozen and tha. a 1:10 dilution of each supernatant was prepared, followed by 10 serial 2-fold-dilutions, and added to HeLa cell monolayers. after 48 h, cell mortality was measured using an MTT assay. g/mL ribavirin were separately added onto the cells at either before (\u20131 h), during (0 h), or after (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h) HRV-4 infection at 37\u00b0C. real-time qRT-PCR with SYBR Green dye was carried out. the PCR conditions were as follows: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and then 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s. mRNA expression level of target gene was normalized to mRNA expression level for housekeeping gene B2M. dilutions of primary antibodies were dilulted 500, 2000, and 1000 times for anti-ICAM-1, anti-LDLR, and anti-actin antibodies. dilutions of secondary antibodies were dilulted 500, 2000, and 1000 times for anti-ICAM-1, anti-LDLR, and anti-actin antibodies. gels were transferred onto a polyvinyl difluoride membrane (Pall Corporation, Pensacola, FL) using a electroblotting apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) the membranes for anti-ICAM-1 and anti-LDLR were incubated in blocking solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 4 h to inhibit nonspecific binding. they were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibodies. the sensitivities of the assays were 0.3 ng/mL. concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF in cell-free culture supernatants were measured using specific ELISA kits. antiviral activity of PGG, GA, and PA toward HRV-2 and HRV-4 in HeLa cells was compared with that of ribavirin using an MTT assay. the antiviral activity of GA (IC50, 426.99 M for HRV-2; 448.10 M for HRV-4) was the lowest of any of the test compounds.

HRV-2 and HRV-4 evoked a significant increase in IL-6 mRNA expression levels in the nontreated cell cultures. interleukin (IL)-6 (A) and IL-8 (E) were detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in MRC5 supernatants 2 days after infection in the presence of 100 g/mL paeonol (PA) or 20 g/mL 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl--D-glucopyranose (PGG) each bar represents the mean SD of triplicate samples of three independent experiments. each bar represents the mean SD of triplicate samples of three independent experiments. effect on TLR3 mRNA expression in HRV-2 or HRV-4 infected cells increased compared with uninfected cells. the antiviral activity of PA (IC50, 608. 38 M for HRV-2; 513.84 M for HRV-4) was the lowest of any of the test compounds. these compounds were not cytotoxic toward human rhinovirus-2 and -4. PA (IC50, 503.13 M) and HRV-4 (17.33 M) showed significantly lower antiviral activity than ribavirin toward HRV-2. GA was ineffective toward both virus serotypes at all test concentrations. treatment with 100 g/mL PA and 20 g/mL PGG resulted in reducing HRV-2 replication by log0.88 and log0.68. the HRV-4 titers were reduced in the cultures treated with PA and PGG by 30.3 and 36.0%, respectively.

ELISA in the HRV-2 or HRV-4 infected cells were significantly higher than those in the noninfected cells without the treatment. however, IL-6 concentrations in infected cultures were reduced by treatment with 100 g/mL PA or 20 g/mL PGG. similar results were observed with IL-8 (Fig 8B) mRNA expression was detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in MRC5 2 days after infection in the presence of 100 g/mL paeonol (PA) and 20 g/mL 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl--D-glucopyranose (PGG) each bar represents the mean SD of triplicate samples of three independent experiments. ic acid, IC50 30.72 M [32]; orobol 7-O-D-glucoside, IC50 1.29\u201319.62 M [33]); organic acid (e.g., raoulic acid, IC50 0.51 M [34]); gallic acid, IC50 294.55 M [35]; raoulic acid, IC50 0.51 M [34]; gallic acid, IC50 294.55 M [35] the modes of antiviral action of plant secondary substances have been well documented by Rollinger and Schmidtke [1] and Kitazato et al. [39]. targeting virus molecules is likely more specific and less toxic, but there is a narrow spectrum of viruses and a higher risk of creating resistant viruses. major group uses ICAM-1 as a mechanism to gain entry to the host cell. mICAM-1 expression is equally induced by major and minor group HRVs. sICAm-1 protein levels of infected cultures were significantly lower than those in cultures without the compound treatment. HRV infection induces the production of numerous components of innate immunity including kinins, leukotrienes, histamine, interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8), TNF, and regulated by activation normal T cell expressed and secreted by activation normal T cell expressed and secreted [2,51] expression levels in infected cell cultures treated with PA were lower than those in the infected cell cultures without the constituent. the constituents reduced expressions of TLR3 and cytokines, such as TNF, IFN-, and IL-1, which resulted in decreasing symptoms induced by HRV."}
