{"summary": "Hendra and Nipah viruses are highly pathogenic in humans and other animal species (10, 15, 17) they are enveloped viruses, classified as biosafety level four agents due to the absence of treatments and vaccines. a detailed map of Hendra and Nipah virus F endocytic trafficking remains unclear. a detailed map of Hendra and Nipah virus F endocytic trafficking remains unclear. the surface population was isolated by streptavidin pulldowns. expression of DN Rab5 slows the kinetics of Hendra virus F cleavage. surface proteins were labeled with biotin. CT YSRL motif is present only 6 residues from the TMD. the protein is targeted either to the plasma membrane, the recycling endosomes, or the late endosomes (30, 44). these processes are complex as endocytic compartments are highly dynamic (44). enza virus 5 (PIV5) F TMD confirmed that the TMD forms a helical structure and that the interacting face of the three helices was likely formed primarily of leucine and isoleucine residues (2). a leucine-isoleucine zipper spans the length of the Hendra virus F HRB and TMD (Fig. 1A) pGEM4Z-Hendra virus F or pET11A SN-Hendra F TMD were subcloned from pGEM to pCAGGS as previously described (56). the mutants were subcloned from pGEM to pCAGGS as previously described (56). pEGFP-Rab7 and pEYFP-Lamp1 were obtained from Addgene (Addgene plasmids 12605 [9] and 1816 [67]) the pET11A vector containing SN linked to the glycophorin TMD was cloned into this vector to replace the glycophorin TMD and fused to SN using the SmaI and XhoI restriction sites. cells were labeled for 2 h with trans-35S (100 Ci/ml; Perkin Elmer); washed twice with PBS. cells were then biotinylated using 1 ml EZ-Link sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin. lysates were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 12 min at 4\u00b0C. 500 l of biotinylation buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin [BSA]) samples were washed twice with RIPA buffer containing 0.30 M NaCl, twice with RIPA buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl, and one time with SDS wash II buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tri goat anti-mouse DyLight 549 secondary antibody was removed. cells were washed seven times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. cells were visualized with a 60 oil objective. sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, using three protein concentrations and three rotor speeds (20,000, 25,000, and 30,000 rpm) the equilibrium profiles were analyzed with KaleidaGraph, using the following equation: A ( r ) = n n, 0 exp [ M n ( 1 v ) 2 2 R T ( r 2 r 0 2 the genes were ligated into the pCAGGS mammalian expression vector (51) as previously described (56) the constructs were sequenced in their entirety, and the Hendra virus F mutants were subcloned from pGEM to pCAGGS. polyclonal antibodies were generated to residues 526 to 539 of the Hendra virus F cytoplasmic tail. monoclonal antibody 7F7 to the Hendra virus F ectodomain was provided by Christopher Broder (Uniformed Services University) lysates were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 12 min at 4\u00b0C. lysates were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 12 min at 4\u00b0C. lysates were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. vero cells in subconfluent monolayers were transfected with 0.3 g of WT or mutant Hendra virus F, along with 0.3 g of GFP-expressing Rab5, Rab7, or Rab4 or YFP-Lamp1 using Lipofectamine 2000. cells were washed five times with PBS, followed by incubation for 40 min at 4\u00b0C with PBS containing 1% normal goat serum (NGS), 1% bovine serum albumin, and the 7 subconfluent monolayers of Vero cells were transfected with WT Hendra virus F or the described Hendra virus F mutants along with Hendra virus G. the transfection was performed using lipofectamine Plus, and the F-to-G ratio was 1:2 (0.5 g of F and 1 g of G) the monomer molecular mass, M, and the partial specific volumes, v, were calculated using SEDNTERP. for the monomer\u2013N-mer fits, the molecular mass of the monomer was kept constant. the best fit was chosen based on the smallest square root of the variance. the surface population of Hendra virus F was then isolated by immunoprecipitation and streptavidin pulldown. expression of DN Rab5 dramatically decreased the processing of Hendra virus F. however, no significant reduction in processing was seen in the presence of DN Rab7. Hendra virus F is recycled through the early endosomal compartments. the compartments where the Hendra virus F-cathepsin L interaction occurs are identified. the compartments where the Hendra virus F-cathepsin L interaction occurs are identified. vero cells were transfected with Hendra virus F and one of the GFP-Rabs. the next day, cells were washed and incubated for 40 min at 4\u00b0C. cleavage of Hendra virus F occurs rapidly after endocytosis. by 20 min Hendra virus F was still predominantly present in Rab5- and Rab4-positive compartments (Fig. 4A and B) but almost no colocalization with late endosomal/lysosomal markers (Fig. 4C and D). surface proteins were labeled with biotin. a chase was performed for the times indicated on Fig. 5. surface expression of WT or S490A Hendra virus F was biotinylated. wild-type or S490A Hendra virus F was expressed in vero cells, labeled for 2 h, and chased for 1.5 h. TPCK-trypsin (1.0 g/ml) was added to the chase medium and cells were incubated for an additional 30 min. trypsin-cleaved S490A Hendra virus F was fusogenically active. also, the S490A mutation does not cause additional changes in the structure or function of the protein. antibody capture experiments were performed as described in the text. the hydroxyl group of S490 is important for proper trafficking of Hendra virus F. the mutants were cleaved and recycled back to the cell surface at rates similar to those of the WT Hendra virus F. fusion activity of these mutants was examined using a syncytium assay. hydroxyl group at position 490 predicted to be near the TMD-ectodomain border mediates Hendra virus F recycling. previous work from our lab has not detected the phosphorylation of Hendra virus F. surface biotinylation experiments were performed in the presence of DN Rab5, which inhibits endocytosis. when endocytosis was blocked, much higher levels of F0 S490E/S490K were detected on the cell surface. data suggest that Hendra virus F endocytosis and recycling are finely tuned by residues at the Hendra virus F TMD-ectodomain border. Y498A, Y498F, Y498S, and Y498L mutants were targeted toward degradation after cathepsin L cleavage. the cleaved form of these mutants can be triggered to undergo conformational changes needed for fusion. the fusion activity of Hendra virus F Y498 mutants was also examined using a syncytium assay. only the correctly cleaved and recycled Hendra virus F Y498F mutant formed syncytia. the Y498A substitution alters Hendra virus F TMD-TMD association. endra virus F protein have shown a strong correlation between loss of surface expression and trimerization defects within the whole protein (21, 22) the mutants were transported efficiently from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface, suggesting that these mutations do not significantly impact overall protein folding and trimerization. however, as our Hendra virus F model with a continuous leucine-isoleucine zipper places the Y498 residue at the helical interface, we tested if Y498 the overall best fit was that of monomer-trimer for the WT and Y498 TMD mutants tested. however, the association constants of Y498A were only 34% to 50% of those of the wild type. the association constants of Y498S were about 70% of that of the wild type. 30,000 rpmb WT 1 0.70 0.26 Y498A 0.34 0.03 0.35 0.07 Y498F 0.97 0.33 0.80 0.20 Y498S 0.67 0.07 0.49 0.18. b Relative to WT F at 25,000 rpm, (1.001 0.33) 109 M2. the surface population of Hendra virus F was then isolated by immunoprecipitation and streptavidin pulldown. expression of DN Rab5 dramatically decreased the processing of Hendra virus F. no significant reduction in processing was seen in presence of DN Rab7. Hendra virus F colocalizes at steady state using immunofluorescence experiments. Rab5 plays important roles in the fusion of the incoming endocytosed vesicles with the sorting endosomes. Rab4 is involved in membrane recycling from the sorting endosomes. vero cells were transfected with Hendra virus F and one of the GFP-Rabs. the next day, cells were washed and incubated for 40 min at 4\u00b0C. cleavage of Hendra virus F occurs rapidly after endocytosis. by 20 min Hendra virus F was still predominantly present in Rab5- and Rab4-positive compartments (Fig. 4A and B), with almost no colocalization with late endosomal/lysosome markers. this suggests that Hendra virus F processing uses the classical recycling pathway for its processing. surface F was biotinylated and separated by streptavidin pulldown. a chase was performed for the times indicated on Fig. 5A. the Hendra virus F S490A mutant was also present in the F0 form. TPCK-trypsin (1.0 g/ml) was added to the chase medium. cells were labeled for 2 h, followed by a 30-min incubation with 1 g/ml TPCK-trypsin. trypsin-cleaved S490A Hendra virus F was fusogenically active. the mutation does not cause additional changes in the structure or function of the protein. antibody capture experiments were performed as described above. Hendra virus F S490T was cleaved and recycled back to the cell surface. the mutant disappeared by the 2-h time point without returning to the cell surface in the active F1 form at later time points. these results suggest that the hydroxyl group of S490 is important for proper trafficking of Hendra virus F. a hydroxyl group at position 490, predicted to be near the TMD-ectodomain border, mediates Hendra virus F recycling. previous work from our lab has not detected the phosphorylation of Hendra virus F. however, transient phosphorylation could occur but go undetected by anti-phospho antibodies. ocytosis was blocked, much higher levels of F0 S490E/S490K were detected on the cell surface, suggesting that after internalization, a fraction of S490E/S490K Hendra virus F was mistrafficked toward degradation. alanine substitution of Hendra virus F TMD residue Y498 resulted in a protein that reached the cell surface in the F0 uncleaved form at early time points but disappeared from the surface without returning in the time course of surface expression of WT and Y498A Hendra virus F in the presence or absence of DN Rab5. the cathepsin L inhibitor E64D (10 M) was added to the medium during starvation, label, and chase. each experiment was repeated at least three times with similar results. the fusion activity of Hendra virus F Y498 mutants was also examined using a syncytium assay. only the correctly cleaved and recycled Hendra virus F Y498F mutant formed syncytia (Fig. 7), while Hendra virus F Y498A, Y498S, and Y498L mutants were fusogenically inactive (Fig. 7 and data not shown) or Y498 mutants were transported efficiently from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface, suggesting that these mutations do not significantly impact overall protein folding and trimerization. for our study we used a chimeric protein containing the staphylococcal nuclease (SN) protein linked to the Hendra virus F WT TMD (residues 485 to 520) the association constants of Y498A were only 34% to 50% of those of the wild type (Table 1). the association constants of Y498S were about 70% of that of the WT, suggesting altered TMD interactions may contribute to the trafficking defect. the data represent averages of three or four independent protein concentrations, spun at 25,000 rpm or 30,000 rpm, relative to the WT value. the errors represent the standard error of the mean. a number of signals involved in endocytic recycling have been identified. our results suggest that cathepsin L is present and functionally active in early endosomal compartments. cathepsin L proteolysis in lysosomal-like environments resulted in extensive degradation. proteolysis under endosomal-like conditions resulted in few fragments of higher molecular weight. s identified in our study, S490 and Y498, are likely situated in the outer half of the bilayer. a charge at this position, either positive (S490K) or negative (S490E), allows partial recycling of Hendra virus F. transferrin receptor also contains two phenylalanine residues toward the middle of its TMD. but their function in recycling has not been determined. isolated WT and mutant F protein TMDs associate as monomer-trimers. virus occurs in the basolateral region, in accordance with the systemic infection generated by these viruses (17, 64) this contrasts with the apical budding and limited infection of the majority of paramyxoviruses."}
