{"summary": "cyclical changes in the congestion state of the nasal mucosa associated with nasal cycle may result in plasma extravasation and nasal fluid formation. cyclical changes in the congestion state of the nasal mucosa associated with nasal cycle may result in plasma extravasation and nasal fluid formation. the amount of collected nasal secretion was significantly higher at 6 a.m. than at 3 p.m. after a metacholine nasal challenge. a statistically higher concentration of inflammatory mediators was detected in the nasal secretions of allergic rhinitis patients after a challenge in the morning than in the afternoon. the regulator of these circadian rhythms at the molecular level has yet to be determined. normal control subjects and patients with moderate/severe persistent allergic rhinitis were selected for this study. the clinical characteristics of normal control and allergic patients are presented in Table 1. all tissue samples were divided into three parts. the first and second parts were stored at \u201370 \u00b0C for RNA and protein isolation. the third part of samples was used for immunohistochemistry. reagent used for cDNA synthesis in reaction mixture containing 2.5 U of MML-V. resulting cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR or real time PCR.

Immunohistochemical and western blot analysis. the extracted protein from frozen tissue samples was resolved on 4\u201312% Tris glycin SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, Mass., USA) the intensity of detected bands was quantified using a -actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif., USA). the intensity of detected bands was quantified using Scion Image Beta 4.0.2 Data analysis Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS for Windows. the expression levels of PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 genes using GAPDH (A, D) or EEF1A1 (B, E) as housekeeping gene in congested (cong) and decongested (deco) nasal mucosa of normal controls (n = 24) and allergic rhinitis patients (n = 13) are compared by using real time PCR (D, E) the expression levels of PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 genes were higher in decongested mucosa than in congested mucosa in normal controls and allergic patients. the levels of these clock genes expressed in decongested mucosa were not different between normal and allergic patients. levels decreased at ZT24 before increasing again at ZT30 (95% CI, cosinor, p0.001) PER2 mRNA levels in mucosa from the left nasal cavity peaked at ZT3 and ZT12 (95% CI, cosinor, p 0.001). in mucosa from the left nasal cavity, PER2 mRNA levels were opposite to those detected in right nasal cavity. expression levels of PER1, PER2 and CLOCK the expression of protein products of these genes was found in the nasal mucosa of rat nasal cavity. rat PER1 and PER2 proteins were predominantly distributed in the superficial epithelial layer and submucosal glands. the expression levels of MUC5AC and aquaporin 5 genes may be associated with circadian expression levels of clock genes in human and rat nasal mucosa. the results of these experiments showed that aquaporin 5 levels showed circadian rhythms in rat nasal mucosa. a circadian clock is present in human and rat nasal mucosa, acting as distinct, circadian oscillators to set the circadian rhythm. a circadian rhythm in nasal mucosa is likely to function independently of the central clock distributed in the brain. clock genes may play their divergent roles in the physiological function of human and rat nasal mucosa. in rat nasal mucosa, PER1 and PER2 might be involved in secretory function, whereas CLOCK and BMAL1 genes might regulate blood supply. however, the control process underlying the nasal cycle is not understood. nous anastomosis regulates nasal mucosa blood flow by alternating smooth muscle tone. the volume of blood flow in nasal mucosa affects nasal resistance. dilation of vascular sinusoid can result in nasal congestion, contributing to nasal obstruction. rheumatoid arthritis patients showed a clear circadian rhythm with a peak at ZT13 in both control and asthmatic mice. no significant differences in the daily rhythmic pattern of PER1, PER2, and PER2 expression were observed in control and asthmatic mice. this suggests that allergic responses in the lung may not interact with clock functions. bone marrow-derived basophils in wild-type mice showed circadian variation in IL-4 and histamine production. expression levels of PER1 and PER2 were the highest at ZT3 and ZT12 on the right side. expression levels of aquporin5 were not different between the two nasal cavities in human and rat nasal mucosa. muscarinic receptors in the mouse lung show a circadian rhythm in their expression levels. it is speculated that the circadian regulation of mucin secretion is controlled by the muscarinic receptors. further experiments are needed to assess the circadian regulation of mucin secretion."}
