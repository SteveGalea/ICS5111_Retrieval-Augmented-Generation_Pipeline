{"summary": "live bacterial vaccines can be classified as a self-limiting asymptomatic organism stimulating an immune response to one or more expressed antigens. live bacterial vaccines can be designed to induce an immune response to itself or to a carried heterologous antigen. the vaccine component may be a classical antigen but may also be allergens or therapeutics. ty21a contains live attenuated Salmonella typhi and is administered orally as a liquid or as acid resistant capsules. the other registered vaccine based on live bacteria is against cholera and is administered orally as a single dose of attenuated Vibrio cholerae (CVD 103-HgR) in liquid formulation. the first use of a live bacterial vaccine consisted of a subcutaneous injection of weakened Vibrio cholerae. the first live oral V. cholerae vaccine candidate did not appear until the 1980s. CVD 103 Hg-R has been found to be both safe and immunogenic after a single oral dose. guanine auxotrophic Shigella flexneri 2a was attenuated further by deleting two genes encoding enterotoxins. pathogenic Shigella has a virulence plasmid encoding proteins involved in thesecretion apparatus. plasmid DNA encodes an antigen, which is expressed by the protein synthesis apparatus of the infected cells. asd pCMV Guinea pig, in vitro [80] asd CS3 and LTB/STm Mouse [81] rfbF HIV-1 SF2Gag Mouse [17] dapB -gal, gene vaccine In vitro [16] aroA iscA gp120, gene vaccine Mouse [15] salmonella enterica aroA pCMV, pCMVactA and pCMVhly In vitro, mouse [82] LAB are attractive for use as vaccine vehicles. non-pathogenic status circumvents the need to construct attenuated mutants. antigen specific immune responses have been obtained with several LAB. the most frequently used model antigen is TTFC in which good results have been obtained both in intranasal and oral mice models using strains of L. plantarum and L. lactis. cytoplasmic expression was superior to surface exposed TTFC in L. lactis. mdez-Humar\u00e1n et al [29] tested human papillomavirus type 16 E7 antigen sorted in different cellular compartments. labile antigen can protect it from proteolytic degradation and environmental stress encountered at the mucosal surfaces. genetic modification of the LAB cell wall rendering the strain more permeable increases the release of cytoplasmic TTFC antigen. IgE epitopes were fused to proteinase PrtB and cell wall-anchored. subcutaneous and intranasal immunization of mice induced a systemic IgG response against human IgE. however, it remains to be proven if these antibodies are protective in human patients. induction of tolerance to the infectious agent is considered a side effect. this side effect is more prone to happen when vaccinating early in life. however, induction of tolerance can have positive clinical implications when the purpose is to treat allergy. a down regulation in allergic persons and an immune stimulating effect in normal persons was observed when using same strain of LAB. different LAB strains induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles in BALB/c mice. in healthy and allergic subjects the strain was immune stimulatory. birch pollen allergen Bet v1 both strains skewed the immune response from Th2 to Th1 in sensitised mice. the immune polarizing effect of LAB has also been observed in humans. thirty volunteers were randomlyised into three groups receiving L. rhamnosus GG, L. lactis or placebo for 7 days. antigen encoding gene cassette can be inserted into the chromosome replacing the metabolic essential gene. if the bacterium acquires the deleted gene it will automatically loose the antigen-encoding cassette. different alternatives to antibiotic resistance marker genes have been published. a theoretical side effect of vaccines is the possible induction of autoimmune reactions. there is no recommendation to avoid vaccination of people with an ongoing autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. the thyA gene is dependant on thymidine or thymine for growth. acquirement of an intact thyA gene would recombine the transgene out of the genome, resulting in reversion to its wild type state. safety concerns of the antigen encoding sequence In live bacterial vaccines the antigen-encoding gene is either plasmid located or integrated in to the chromosome. foreign DNA should be avoided in the final product and a limit has been defined as for maximum residual amount per human dose. insertion of foreign DNA into the host genome is by definition insertional mutagenesis. 2 out of 10 patients developed leukaemia within 3 years of [60,61]. a report of adverse effects in a french gene therapy study shows a transformation event by activation of a proto-oncogene. this frequency must be put in relation to the spontaneous mutation frequency which has been estimated in humans to occur at the rate of 1 in every 50 million nucleotides incorporated during DNA replication. the route of administration of the vaccine may also be important when evaluating hazards. the existence of genes in the bacterial vaccine coding for such potential allergens or other injurious peptides can be checked beforehand searching for homologies to known allergens. mmunity is determined more by genetic factors than by vaccine challenge. attenuated pathogens as vaccines and vaccine vehicles Lindberg has excellently reviewed the history of live bacterial vaccines. the first live oral V. cholerae vaccine candidate did not appear until the 1980s. guanine auxotrophic Shigella flexneri 2a was attenuated further by deleting two genes encoding enterotoxins. pathogenic Shigella has a virulence plasmid encoding proteins involved in thesecretion apparatus and proteins necessary for the entry process into human cells. attenuated bacteria as vaccine vehicles Vaccine strain Attenuation Foreign insert Model Ref.

LAB elegantly can be used for the delivery of neutralising antibodies at mucosal sites. induction of tolerance to the infectious agent is considered a side effect. mucosal co-application of L. plantarum or L. lactis shifted immune response towards anti-allergic Th1 response in sensitized and un-sensitized animals. in vivo effects in both mice [39] and pigs [40] have been observed. more knowledge on mechanisms behind skewing the immune response is needed. two different lactobacilli with similar probiotic properties in vitro were shown to elicit divergent patterns of colonisation and immune response in germfree mice. further evidence for an immune modulating effect is seen when either L. lactis or L. plantarum was used in a mouse model of birch pollen allergy [38] attenuation usually involves deletion of essential virulence factors or mutation of genes encoding metabolic enzymes. the bacteria still express virulence determinants important to elicit a protective immune response. defined deletions of at least two metabolic essential genes are usually used. a theoretical side effect of vaccines is the possible induction of autoimmune reactions. there is no recommendation to avoid vaccination of people with an ongoing autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. bacterial vaccines to the environment are a concern. however, attenuated human pathogens are usually not adapted to live outside its host. the use of auxotrophic mutants unable to replicate in the environment can cause debate. the amount of accumulating plasmid that is acceptable outside the target cells needs to be further clarified. the antigen encoding sequence for protein and DNA vaccines Transfer of undesired genes via plasmid Transfer of vector to indigenous flora. retroviral insertion and homologous recombination can be avoided by omission of sequences necessary for insertion. retroviral insertion is a risk associated with retroviral vaccination. 2 out of 10 patients developed leukaemia within 3 years. integration of the plasmid harboured by bacterial vaccine vehicles is a potential hazard. omitting sequences driving the insertion may limit the possibility for integration of the plasmid carried by the bacterium. the presence of post vaccination autoantibodies was not associated with any clinical or histological sign of autoimmunity. however, in normal mice prone to autoimmunity (NZBxNZW) F1 a severe pathology attributed to autoimmunity was observed. this difference in outcome attributed to the difference in genotype has also been observed in humans. the probability of horizontal gene transfer to other bacteria present should be avoided by using host restricted replication units."}
