{"summary": "Molecular assays have generally been evaluated by comparing them to conventional direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or viral culture techniques. we tested nasal and throat swab specimens obtained from 225 infants with respiratory illness for 11 common respiratory viruses using both a multiplex assay (RMA) and individual real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR) the performance of molecular diagnostic methods, either RT-rtPCR or multiplex assays, typically has been evaluated by comparing them with conventional direct fluorescent antibody or culture. compared a multiplex respiratory virus panel with RT-rtPCR (Vanderbilt University) RNA was extracted on an automated instrument (MagNApure Total Nucleic Acid extraction kit; Roche Applied Science), and refrozen at -80\u00b0C until each individual RT-rtPCR was performed. primers and probes for HCoV-NL63, OC43, 229E, RSV, HMPV and HRV were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) M Probe (5' to 3') M \u00b0C Ref HRV (5' UTR)$ CY+AGCC+TGCGTGGC 0.8 GAAACACGGACACCCAAAGTA 0.8 TCCTCCCCCCCCTGAATGYGGC 0.1 60 [20] 1st Round RSV (M) GGAAACATACGTGAAGCTTCA 1 A: CATCATCTTTTTTCTAGAACATTGTACTGAA 0.5 2nd Round RSV (M a multitarget, high throughput technology that integrates multiplex PCR and microsphere flow cytometry. Luminex technology can detect up to 80 targets in one reaction. the RT-rtPCR assay included 19 viral targets. we report results for the same 11 viruses tested by the RT-rtPCR assays. both sites were blinded to the results from the other laboratory. all specimens collected during this period were included in the study. the samples were divided into aliquots, lysis buffer added, and specimens were frozen at -80\u00b0C. RNA was extracted on an automated instrument and refrozen at -80\u00b0C. cycling conditions were 30 min at 50\u00b0C, 15 min at 94\u00b0C, and 45 cycles of 8 seconds at 94\u00b0C and 60 seconds at 55-66\u00b0C. all samples were tested by a commercial RT-rtPCR assay for human beta-actin mRNA (Applied Biosystems) to ensure RNA integrity.

RSV In the first round of testing, RMA detected more RSV (n = 98, 44%) than RT-rtPCR (n = 78, 35%) of the positive samples detected by RMA, 67 were RSV A and 32 were RSV B. of the 42 RSV B detected by RMA, RT-rtPCR only detected RSV B in 6 (14.2%) samples. SV RT-rtPCR was identified in 107 (49%) samples with RT-rtPCR. the inter rater agreement for RSV between the repeat RT-rtPCR and the first RMA was 0.86. 12 samples were positive for RSV with repeat RT-rtPCR testing. human metapneumovirus NL63 was detected in 8 (3.5%) samples through RMA and 6 (2.7%) samples through RT-rtPCR. HCoV OC43 was detected in 5 (2.3%) samples through RT-rtPCR. no PIV3 was detected by either method. RT-rtPCR detected RSV in 65 (97%) of the 67 RSV A identified through RMA. of the 42 RSV B detected by RMA, RT-rtPCR only detected RSV B in 6 (14.2%) samples. human rhinovirus RT-rtPCR detected HRV in 63 (28.2%) samples compared to the RMA, which detected HRV in 56 (25.1%) samples. in two of the discordant samples, RT-rtPCR detected HRV while the RMA detected enterovirus. sensitivity and specificity of multiplex viral diagnostic assays have generally been compared to viral culture and DFA[1], instead of more sensitive RT-rtPCR methods. comparison of molecular methods with other sensitive molecular techniques, such as RMA with RT-rtPCR, is appropriate to determine whether the sensitivity for each analyte is sufficient for clinical or research use. the first round of comparison revealed differences in the rates of detection for specific viruses. mutation[30] is particularly true for influenza, which undergoes considerable variation every year. this is particularly true for influenza, which undergoes considerable variation every year. inclusion of two probe sets that target two different parts of the viral genome might eliminate the risk of nondetection. multiplex assays may offer substantial savings in time and cost due to multiple analytes. differences highlight the need for similar comparisons between molecular assays on a routine basis.
