{"summary": "artificial abzymes are abzymes against analogs of transition states of catalytic reactions [1]\u2013[5] or antiidiotypic Abs induced by a primary antigen. different abzymes may play a significant role in forming specific pathogenic patterns and clinical settings in different autoimmune conditions. etiology remains unclear, and the most valid theory of its pathogenesis assigns the main role in the destruction of the myelin-proteolipid shell of axons. the normal functioning of the B-cell system is also important for the development of the disease. an enhanced synthesis of immunoglobulins (usually IgGs), their free light chains and of a polyspecific DNA binding Abs interacting with phospholipids can be observed in MS patients [15]. in the present study we have for the first time compared a relative content of total protein, -IgGs and -IgGs as well as IgGs of all four subclasses (IgG1-IgG4) in sera and CSFs of MS patients. we provide, for the first time, a very strong direct evidence that proteolytic anti-MBP activity is intrinsic to IgGs from CSF of MS patients. MRI activity = presence or absence gadolinium enhancing lesions at MRI examination. relative concentrations of total protein of CSF and sera of MS patients varied in different ranges. Ratio (%) of 2 and 4 (p), ** Abs or PR, mg/ml (1) Abs, % (2) Abs or PR, mg/ml (3) Abs, % (4) Total protein 62.56.7 100 0.480.09 100 136 1.0 total-IgG 11.71.8 100 (6.03.1)102 100 195 1.0 -IgG 1.40.07 12.30.6 (0.480.1)102 8.01.7 292 1.54 (1.4106) -IgG 10.30. relative content was calculated for the same 100-fold dilution of CSFs and sera. the relative content of -Abs in the sera was significantly higher. the relative content of -Abs was approximately 1.54-fold statistically significantly higher. the content of IgG1 (%) in 15 CSF was to some extent comparable. the average relative content (%) of IgG1 in the sera was 1.3-fold statistically significantly higher than for CSFs. the difference in values in sera was significantly higher in the various patients. the highest content of IgG1 was observed in sera, while IgG2 for CSF was higher than that in the sera. in general, the content of IgG1 and IgG3 was higher than that in the sera. healthy donors are not zero and changed from 0.02 to 0.16 A450 units, in average 0.090.04 [17] we could not estimate real indexes of anti-MBP Abs in CSF of seven healthy donors, since A450 values in this case did not remarkably differ from background values. homogeneity of 150-kDa csf-IgGmix and ser-IgGmix confirmed by SDS-PAGE with silver staining. csf-IgGmix and ser-IgGmix corresponding to seven healthy donors were also electrophoretically homogeneous. the relative MBP-hydrolyzing activity was revealed using the extracts of 2-3-mm fragments of one longitudinal slice of the gel. the second control longitudinal slice of the same gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (lane 1, ser-IgGmix; lane 2, csf-IgGmix) the average error in the initial rate determination from three experiments did not exceed 7\u201310%. csf-IgGmix and ser-IgGmix corresponding to seven healthy donors were also catalytically inactive after FPLC gel-filtration of Absmix under conditions of \u201cacidic shock\u201d and affinity chromatography on anti-IgG Sepharose. csf-IgGmix and ser-IgGmix corresponding to seven healthy donors were also inactive after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. csf-IgGmix and ser-IgGmix corresponding to seven healthy donors were also inactive after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. classical mammalian, bacterial, and viral proteases are mostly unspecific and capable to hydrolyze any proteins or specific to bacterial and viral proteins. csf-IgGs specifically hydrolyzed only MBP, but not other control tested proteins. 8.5 kDa MBP containing no significant amounts of other forms of the protein was calculated from the decrease in the intensity of Coomassie-stained 18.5 kDa MBP band after electrophoresis. the difference in the intensities of the protein, incubated in the absence and in the presence of Abs, was used for our calculations. RAs of the sera IgGs varied in a range 0.21\u20137.5 nmole MBP per hour per mg of Abs and apparent kcat in the range (0.051\u20131.8 min1)102 min1. the average values of RAs were 3.01.7 nM MBP per hour per mg of Abs (average apparent kcat (7.44.8)103 min1) nmole MBP/1 h/mg k cat, min1 RA, nmole MBP/1 h/mg k cat, min1 1 149.6 0.38 0.77 2.0103 194 2 20.7 0.05 0.23 5.9104 90 3 82.9 0.21 0.91 2.3103 91 4 79.4 0.2 2.42 6.0103 33 5 3.5 0.009 0.21 5.1104 17 6 44.9 0.12 6.4 1.6102 7 7 11 the average specific RA of IgGs from CSFs was about 58.6-fold higher than Abs from the sera. the ratio of specific RAs of MBP-hydrolyzing IgGs in the CSFs and serum of individual patients varied in the range 7 \u2013 194-fold. abzymes of MS patients may be significantly more active in the hydrolysis of MBP than what we found. the fraction of abzymes with different catalytic activities, including protease ones, in the serum of autoimmune patients usually does not exceed 1\u20137% of total immunoglobulins [11]\u2013[14]. anti-MBP abzymes produced by lymphocytes against MBP in different organs of MS patients may have a lower MBP-hydrolyzing activity in comparison with anti-MBP Abs of CSF. there may be different ratio of abzymes and anti-MBP Abs without catalytic activity in the CSFs and sera of MS patients. a direct dependence between titers of anti-MBP and symptoms of lesions of the pyramidal tract could be observed (CC = 0.92) in some cases, correlations of the opposite sign were observed for the same pairs of analyzed parameters for the three subgroups with different MS courses. the absence of a definite dependence between titers of anti-DNA and anti-MBP Abs could be caused by several reasons. titers of Abs to MBP and RAs of abzymes are intrinsic property of IgGs deriving from CSF and sera of patients. titers of Abs to MBP and RAs of abzymes are polyclonal and may consist of extremely different repertoire of protease subfractions in case of CSF and sera of people. we used purified human MBP containing 18.5 kDa form from RCMDT (Moscow; Russia) these preparations were free of lipids, oligosaccharides, nucleic acid, and other possible contaminations. fifteen consecutive MS patients were retrospectively selected for the study. CSF and serum samples were collected under sterile conditions and stored in aliquots at \u201380\u00b0C until assay. \"Cell-free\" CSF samples were obtained after centrifugation of specimens taken by atraumatic lumbar puncture performed for purposes of diagnosis in the absence of contraindications. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated with specific monoclonal mouse Abs against human IgGs (-IgGs, -IgGs, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) were estimated using calibration curves obtained according to the standard manufacturer's protocol. ELISA of anti-MBP autoantibodies Anti-MBP auto-Abs were measured by ELISA. 100 l TBS containing 0.2% bovine albumin and 0.01% NaN3 were added. strips were washed 10 times with water and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. after adding 50 l citric-phosphate buffer containing 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine. IgGs from CSF were incubated in 50 mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.6) containing 0.2 M NaCl for 20 min at 25\u00b0C. separation of the IgGs under \u201cacid shock\u201d conditions was carried out by FPLC gel filtration on a superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with 50 mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.6) containing 0.1 M Na the gels were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 12% or 4\u201315% gradient gels with Coomassie R250 staining. the activities of IgG preparations were determined as a decrease in the percentage of initial MBP converted to different hydrolyzed forms. the gel washed 10 times (7\u201310 min) with H2O. the solution was removed from the gels by centrifugation and used for assay of MBP hydrolysis. the correlation coefficients between samples were analyzed. blood and CSF sampling protocols were approved by the committee for medical ethics in research. the protocol was approved at 31 May 2007 and focused on the creation of a biological bank of CSF and serum samples. the samples were collected under sterile conditions and stored in aliquots at \u201380\u00b0C. CSF and serum samples from MS patients were stored and measured under exactly the same conditions. informed consent was given by all patients before inclusion and the study design was approved. ELISA of anti-MBP autoantibodies Anti-MBP auto-Abs were measured by ELISA. an optimization of all component concentrations, including buffers and time intervals of all operations for the achievement of a maximum difference between control and experimental samples, was carried out. IgG purification Electrophoretically and immunologically homogeneous IgGs were obtained by sequential affinity chromatography of the CSF and serum proteins on protein A-Sepharose and FPLC gel filtration similarly to [17]\u2013[20]. in each case the protein corresponding to the central part of IgG peaks was concentrated in sterile condition and used in further purification or analysis. eous IgGs were chromatographed on sepharose bearing immobilized polyclonal mouse IgGs against human IgGs. the protein was applied to the column (1 ml) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 M NaCl and the column washed with the same buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl. Abs were eluted in 0.1 M glycine SDS-PAGE analysis of Abs for homogeneity was performed in a gel containing 0.1% SDS (Laemmli system) the polypeptides were visualized by silver and Coomassie blue staining. errors in the values were within 5\u201310%. correlation coefficients between samples were analyzed by the Student's t-test."}
