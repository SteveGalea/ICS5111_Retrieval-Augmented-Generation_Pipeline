{"summary": "non-culture-based methods are increasingly used in research to characterize disease in novel environments or organisms. amplicon-based 16S ribosomal DNA profiling can compare whole microbial assemblages from organisms of different health states, but to comprehensively survey viruses, shotgun-based metagenomic sequencing approaches are often required. white plague (WP) is a rapid tissue loss disease that affects multiple species of Caribbean corals. bacterium Aurantimonas coralicida was hypothesized to be the cause of WP type II in the coral Dichocoenia stokesii. a disease of corals in the red sea has been shown to be caused by the bacterial pathogen, Thalassomonas loyana, and not A. coralicida. a virus and not a bacterium may be the cause of some of these WP signs. phycodnavirus-like particles can be present within bleached and/or heat-stressed corals. sequence similarities to and viral-like particles reminiscent of nano-, circo- and geminiviruses also found in corals. colony colonies exhibiting signs of WP are described as 'diseased' colonies showing signs of symbiont loss, which may or may not be due to a pathogen, are described as 'bleached' BD tissue was taken from 5 cm from the D tissue, where disease was progressing from the base of the coral colony. lesions consisted of an area of recent tissue loss where denuded skeleton with little to no algal colonization was delineated from living tissue by a smooth, undulating margin. tissue samples were placed in individual sterile bags underwater, stored on ice and processed on shore within 4 h. all sampled colonies were examined for diseases signs and progression 2 days after sample collections. aliquot of every viral fraction from all samples and density layers was stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen, Carlsband, CA, USA) after this, all samples were again filtered through 0.22 m Sterivex (Billerica, MA, USA) the program DeconSeq was used to identify and remove reads with nucleic acid homology (based on 60% identity and 94% similarity) to eukaryotes (mouse, fish, human and mosquito), bacteria and/or archaea. these conservative quality and similarity parameters may have underestimated viral sequence abundance because viral genomes commonly contain gene sequences homologous to bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Viral family diversity analyses Sequence similarity richness and evenness were determined using the Shannon Index diversity measure, H'=i (pi)(logepi) the index was calculated for all 24 viromes and averaged for each virome type where applicable. significant differences in viral taxa among the virome types were determined using a Kruskal\u2013Wallis test followed by pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni corrections. logenetic analysis of the SCSDVs was performed using the replication (Rep) initiator protein genes (rep) found in all WP Diseased and both Seawater viromes (SWB and SWBD) using the Metavir tool with the \u2018compute phylogenic trees from multiple viromes' option. METAVIR conducts the following steps to construct phylogenetic comparisons. average nucleotide identities were derived from multiple nucleotide alignments of WP Diseased contigs and the genomes of known circoviruses, nanoviruses and satellite DNAs. these percentages were compared across each major category using univariate nonparametric statistics. several SCSDV features also were annotated in GENEIOUS R6 (confirmed by tBLASTx to the non-redundant database) collections took place over 2 days at depths of 5.5\u20137.6 m. temperature at depth was 29.0 \u00b0C. all M. annularis colonies were located within 75 m of each other. two to three plugs of tissue and skeleton were removed from each M. annularis colony using a 2-cm diameter corer and hammer. tissues were cored from both the bleached top \u2018Bleached+WP Diseased (BD)\u2019 and the margin of lesions \u2018WP Diseased (D), which did not show signs of bleaching. tissue from an additional five \u2018Bleached (B)\u2019 non-WP Diseased corals and two \u2018 resulting viral concentrate was preserved in molecular biology grade chloroform. cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation steps were not conducted before extracting DNA from the seawater samples. aliquot of every viral fraction from all samples and density layers were stained with SYBR Gold. the final numbers of replicate libraries for each coral health state or seawater type were: H (n=2), B (n=5), BD (n=7), D (n=7), SWB (n=1) and SWBD (n=1). Virome processing and bioinformatic analyses Sequence reads underwent several preliminary bioinformatic steps. similarities to viruses that lacked any phylogenetic information were removed from the data sets. viral family diversity analyses Sequence similarity richness and evenness were determined using the Shannon Index diversity measure. a cluster analysis was performed only on the WP Diseased coral colonies (D vs DB) a cluster analysis was performed in PRIMER v.6 (Clarke and Gorley, 2006). METAVIR conducts steps to construct phylogenetic comparisons. contigs from WP Diseased libraries were analyzed in metavir's \u2018Contig Map' feature. representative contigs of 1000\u20133000 bp length that had similarities to SCSDVs were compared with annotated genomes from NCBI in GENEIOUS VR6 (Biomatters) two individuals from each health state were examined for the presence of VLPs. results To determine if specific viruses are associated with the documented St Thomas, USVI WP-like Disease outbreak, we generated 24 pyrosequenced shotgun viromes. these libraries totald over 1 million reads, of which >360 000 passed quality control and in silico contaminant screening. aryotic viral comparisons, percentage of similarities to Circoviridae (15.217), Nanoviridae (7.913) and satellite DNAs (alpha satellites; 8.616) ranged from 0% (in Healthy tissue) to 64% (WP Diseased tissue) the ratio of phage to eukaryotic viral sequence similarities in the SWB sample also was 1.47-fold higher than in the SWBD library. values in bold are statistically different from healthy sample values. 4% of known eukaryotic virus similarities in at least one coral tissue or seawater sample were compared among coral tissue health states and seawater viromes. similarities to SCSDVs, including Circoviridae, Nanoviridae and satellite DNAs were statistically more abundant in the WP Diseased libraries. 4% of the total known eukaryotic viral similarities detected for a given sample type (a) the rare virome (b) or the viral similarities comprising 4% of the total known eukaryotic viral similarities detected for a given sample type (a) the mean relative percentage of similarities to each viral type was lumped into \u2018groups' based on their common evolutionary history. Phycodnaviridae \u2014 1.78 >0.05 Polydnaviridae \u2014 1.01 >0.05 Poxviridae \u2014 4.53 >0.05 Abbreviations: B, Bleached; B, Bleached+WP Diseased; D, WP Diseased; H, Healthy; WP, white plague. Bold value indicates significant difference (P0.05). the two Healthy samples (green hexagons) were located furthest from the WP Diseased tissues. ANOSIM results comparing sequence similarities in viral consortia from different health states and adjacent seawater. similarity of percentage analysis determined which viral families contributed to virome dissimilarity. diseased viromes contain higher eukaryotic viral diversity than healthy corals. Phylogenetic trees were created using the viral Rep protein of SCSDVs identified within the seven WP Diseased and two Seawater viromes. the tree contained over 50 sequences, with all of the WP Diseased and Seawater viromes contributing at least one Rep sequence similarity. VLPs corroborates genomic-based findings that herpes-like viruses, SCSDVs and NCLDVs, were present in coral tissue. however, quantitative TEM analysis could not be performed because of the extensive variation in the quality of the tissues among different health states. for example, tissues were degraded in the WP Diseased samples and cell layers were difficult to discern. os of phage to eukaryotic viral similarities vary among coral tissue health states Theoretically, eukaryotic viruses should increase in abundance relative to bacteriophages in coral tissues or seawater. the ratio of phage to eukaryotic virus sequence similarities trended toward a decrease in WP Diseased (4.771.8) compared with Healthy tissues (19.2115.2). values in bold are statistically different from healthy sample values. 4% of known eukaryotic virus similarities in at least one coral tissue or seawater sample were compared among the coral tissues health states and seawater viromes. similarities to SCSDVs, including Circoviridae, Nanoviridae and satellite DNAs were statistically more abundant in the WP Diseased libraries. the mean relative percentage of similarities to each viral type was lumped into 'groups' based on their common evolutionary history. \u2018SCSDVs' are small circular ssDNA viruses and their associated satellites. herpesviridae similarities were identified in all coral tissue types. but at a higher relative abundance in Healthy than in WP Diseased tissue. these similarities were rare in adjacent seawater and comprised1.5% of the similarities in either seawater virome. seawater viromes (dark and light blue circles) also grouped closer to each other than to viromes generated from any coral tissue types. cluster analysis depicted relatedness between paired viromes generated from Bleached+WP Diseased and WP Diseased tissue of an individual colony. e were present in viromes generated from all tissue health states. these sequences contributed to >31% of the dissimilarity between healthy and WP Diseased tissue viromes. herpesvirus similarities are the most abundant in healthy tissues. the tree contained over 50 sequences, with all of the WP Diseased and Seawater viromes contributing at least one Rep sequence similarity. two main coral SCSDV clades (stars) were distinct (72.4% and 95.0% bootstrap support) from a well-supported Seawater clade. tissues were degraded in the WP Diseased samples and cell layers were difficult to discern. healthy tissues exhibited intact Symbiodinium-host cell attachment and defined tissue layers. signs of degradation were evident in Bleached tissue types. coral small circular ssDNA viruses (SCSDVs) are common pathogens of plants and animals. they include the families: Circoviridae, Nanoviridae, Geminiviridae. their prevalence and distribution in the environment was unknown until recently. the host for the coral-associated SCSDVs presented here is yet to be determined, but may include the algal endosymbiont (Symbiodinium spp., because nanovirus/geminiviruses infect plants), the coral host itself (because circoviruses infect animals), or another member of the coral holobiont (Yu et al., 2010; Delwart and Li, 2012; Rosario et al., 2012; ). iridae were relatively more abundant in bleached coral tissue types than in non-bleached tissue types. previously, poxvirus sequences were found to be more abundant in temperature-stressed corals. a recent study on the scleractinian coral, Acropora millerpora, also contained pox-like virus sequences. this study also corroborates findings that have implicated NCLDVs in the infection of the algal sy a higher viral diversity in WP Diseased corals may be the direct cause of disease signs. a higher viral diversity in WP Diseased corals may be the direct cause of disease signs. a higher viral diversity in WP Diseased corals may be the direct cause of disease signs. a previous comparative study on stressed Pacific coral species used MDA. a majority of our viral sequences were not similar to a known virus or group of viruses. a majority of our viral sequences were not similar to a known virus or group of viruses. a unique viral group, the coral small circular ssDNA viruses (SCSDVs), was associated with a WP disease outbreak in the Caribbean. the virus is common pathogens of plants and animals and include the families: Circoviridae, Nanoviridae, Geminiviridae, but their prevalence and distribution in the environment was unknown until recently. coral and seawater SCSDVs sequenced in this study are genetically distinct from those found in the surrounding seawater samples. the host for the coral-associated SCSDVs presented here is yet to be determined, but may include the algal endosymbiont (Symbiodinium spp., because nanoviruses infect plants), the coral host itself (because circoviruses infect animals) NCLDVs and bleaching Sequence similarities to NCLDVs were relatively more abundant in bleached coral tissue types than in non-bleached tissue types. previously, poxvirus sequences were found to be more abundant in temperature-stressed corals. a recent study on the scleractinian coral, Acropora millerpora, also contained pox-like virus sequences. a higher viral diversity in WP Diseased corals may be the direct cause of disease signs. a higher viral diversity in WP Diseased corals may be the direct cause of disease signs. a higher viral diversity in WP Diseased corals may be the direct cause of disease signs. data sets generated using amplification methods do not amplify ssDNA viruses (such as LASLs) or even after the elimination of a denaturing step that would enrich for ssDNA viruses should be expressed uniformly in each of the sample libraries. a previous comparative study on stressed Pacific coral species also used MDA but detected SCSDV sequences only in 2 viromes out of 6. our microscopy data found no evidence of foreign microbial cells present in WP-infected corals. we also found heterogeneity in the viral consortia among tissue types isolated from the same coral colonies. we hypothesize that WP infection is localized to the disease front."}
