{"summary": "autophagy is mediated by the lysosome, which serves as an end point degradative organelle. autophagy is thus a catabolic process that maintains cellular homeostasis. autophagy is thus a catabolic process that maintains cellular homeostasis by degradative removal of damaged or excess cellular organelles and protein aggregates from the cytoplasm. autophagosomes mature by fusing with endosomes and/or lysosomes to form autolysosomes. the membrane source for the biogenesis of the phagophore is debatable. however, several recent studies have shown that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and plasma membrane (PM) serve as source for the phagophore. autophagosome maturation via docking and fusion with endosomal compartments. the inner autophagosomal membrane and cargo is degraded by acid hydrolases inside the autolysosome. the delivery of membranes to the forming autophagosome is mediated by mammalian Atg9 (mAtg9) studies have shown that selective autophagy plays a crucial role in the elimination of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, termed xenophagy, thus extending the functions of autophagy to innate and adaptive immunity against pathogens. studies have underlined the relevance of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, in linking autophagy adaptor protein function to autophagy substrate recognition [13,14]. cytosolic LC3-I is proteolytically cleaved and coupled to phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE) to form LC3-II, which is inserted into the autophagosomal membrane. infections with a wide range of DNA or RNA viruses increase abundance of autophagosomes or autophagic vesicles in infected cells. infected cells expressing GFP-LC3 with Sindbis virus increased autophagic flux. despite unaltered levels of p62 in infected cells, LC3-II levels were increased upon treatment with lysosomal protease inhibitors (E64 and pepstatin A), arguing that HCV does not block autophagy. a study by Ke and Chen showed that treatment of infected cells with chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 result the authors found that HCV induced autophagosomes that matured into autolysosomes, thus revealing a complete autophagic response in HCV-infected cells. the discrepancy between these two studies might be due to differences in the experimental approaches: HCV infection versus electroporation of HCV RNA. a number of viruses have evolved strategies to interfere with autophagosome formation or maturation. a deletion of ICP34.5 leads to accumulation of HSV-1 particles in autophagosome-like structures. other viruse, such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), influenza A virus (FluAv), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and poliovirus inhibit autophagy by blocking autophagosome maturation or degradation. CD46 (cluster of differentiation 46); CD46 (cluster of differentiation 46); GOPC (Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing protein); KSHV (Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus); MHV68 (murine -herpesvirus 68); fluAV (influenza A virus); CVB3 (coxsackievirus B3); DENV (dengue virus); HCV (Hepatit vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) demonstrated that virus binding to Drosophila S2 cells was required to induce autophagy [31], which occurred via down regulation of mTOR activity and inactivation of Akt signaling. authors show that VSV interacted with Toll-7 at the plasma membrane to induce antiviral autophagy independent of the canonical Toll signaling pathway. PERK mediates the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), resulting in rapid reduction of mRNA translation. IRE1 is autophosphorylated to function as an endoribonuclease. activated ATF6 translocates from the ER to the Golgi to undergo cleavage by regulated intramembrane proteolysis. a very recent study by mohl et al provided evidence that HCV-induced autophagy is independent of UPR [49] it is unclear how autophagy is induced in HCV infection. the impact of these viral proteins on autophagic flux remains to be determined. infected cells contained reduced levels of p62 (an accepted marker of autophagic flux), indicating a complete autophagic response during virus infection. infected cells contained reduced levels of p62 (an accepted marker of autophagic flux), with no significant changes of its mRNA amounts. ers proposed that autophagy is incomplete, and cells transfected with HCV RNA formed autophagosomes that, due to inefficient fusion with lysosomes, did not convert into autolysosomes. a number of viruses have evolved strategies to interfere with autophagosome formation or maturation. studies with CVB3 and poliovirus show that autophagy is inhibited at the stage of autolysosomal degradation. in the case of fluAv, the viral proteins Nef and M2 respectively, block autophagosome maturation by a still poorly defined mechanism that depends on their interaction with Beclin-1 [27,28]. induction of autophagy is triggered by a variety of stress stimuli, including nutrient deprivation, ER stress, danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), hypoxia, redox stress and mitochondrial damage. these stimuli involve a variety of cellular signals that have overlapping functions in autophagy. a very recent study showed that VSV-induced autophagy depends on Toll-7 in S2 cells and in adult flies [46]. the authors show that VSV interacted with Toll-7 at the plasma membrane to induce antiviral autophagy independent of the canonical Toll signaling pathway. IRE1 regulates transcription of genes encoding for ER chaperones, biogenesis of phospholipids and components of the ER-associated protein degradation machinery. activated ATF6 translocates from the ER to the Golgi to undergo cleavage by regulated intramembrane proteolysis. the impact of these viral proteins on autophagic flux remains to be determined. ER stress upon VZV infection is due to abundant VZV glycoprotein biosynthesis, which in turn triggers to UPR and thus, autophagy to maintain cellular homeostasis. autophagy selectively transfers viral nucleic acids to endosomal compartments to stimulate innate immune responses via TLRs. autophagy mediates the delivery of viral antigens to MHC-I and -II complexes to allow antigen presentation. autophagy can be involved in delivering viral PAMPs to endosomal PRRs. the involvement of autophagy in delivering viral PAMPs to endosomal PRRs is conserved in non-immune cells. autophagy adaptors are considered PRRs that can selectively target a variety of pathogens for autophagic degradation. autophagy adaptors are considered as PRRs that can selectively target a variety of pathogens. cytoplasm offers a diverse range of autophagic targets that vary in size and complexity. p62, NBR1 (neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1), NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kDa) and optineurin are the main autophagic adaptors that are classified as SLRs in response to bacterial and viral infections. virophagy and mitophagy is critically determined by SMURF1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts as a bona fide mediator of selective autophagy [62]. Whether SMURF1 is also involved in autophagy of bacterial invaders remains to be determined. SV-1 showed that at early time points after infection, autophagy is not required for viral antigen processing and presentation of MHC-I peptides. however, it remains unknown how degradation of HSV-1 particles by the autophagosome results in the presentation of viral antigens to ER localized MHC-I molecules. ral Replication Most positive-strand RNA viruses re-shape the endomembrane system in order to create membrane-associated replication \u2018factories\u2019. this reorganization of intracellular membranes frequently requires autophagy. these structures stained positive for the viral protein 2BC and 3A. expression of the viral proteins 2BC and 3A resulted in the formation of autophagosome-like DMVs. autophagosomes are dispensable for the biogenesis of viral replication sites. some autophagy proteins can contribute to their morphological heterogeneity. poliovirus, EV71 and FMDV can replicate in the absence of autophagy. y-related proteins beclin 1 (BCN1) and Atg7 inhibited HCV replication in immortalized human hepatocytes (IHHs) a recent study highlighted the importance of the UPR and autophagy during HCV infection and demonstrated that autophagy enhances HCV replication by inhibiting an innate immune response. viral DMVs also stained positive for ER-associated degradation markers. this data suggests that coronaviruses do not require autophagosomes, per se, but utilize components of the autophagy pathway. the precise role of autophagy in viral replication remains to be explored. autophagy has been reported to regulate late steps of the viral replication cycle. cells that are deficient in autophagy produce significantly lower amounts of nucleic acid-containing intra- and extracellular enveloped particles. autophagy has been shown to regulate also these late steps of the viral replication cycle [18,28,78] inhibition of autophagy or silencing of expression of key autophagy factors results in a decrease in infectious particle production. disrupting the microtubule network by using nocodazole treatment or challenging cells with a mutant virus resulted in increased mobility of poliovirus-induced GFP-LC3 structures, concomitant with an increase of extracellular infectious particles. IRGM interacted with the autophagy proteins Atg5, Atg10, MAP1CL3C and SH3GLB1 (SH3-domain GRB2-like endophilin B1). IRGM interacted with Measles virus, HCV and HIV-1 induced autophagy and virion production. this work revealed a primary role of IRGM in virus-induced autophagy. autophagosome can selectively target virions and virus components for degradation via the autolysosome. autophagy selectively transfers viral nucleic acids to endosomal compartments to stimulate innate immune responses via TLRs. LRs and NLRs are mainly localized in the cytoplasm. many RNA viruses release their viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm to establish sites of RNA replication. however, activation of endosomal TLRs can be limited because viral RNA is packed into the nucleocapsid or sequestered in membrane-associated replication complexes. studies with coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3)-infected kidney fibroblasts showed autophagy-dependent activation of TLR3 [56] same study revealed that TLR3-decorated vesicles colocalized with LC3-positive structures. resulting compartments might serve as antiviral platforms specialized in sensing viral PAMPs and eventually triggering downstream signaling events. autophagy adaptors are considered as PRRs that can selectively target a variety of pathogens for autophagic degradation. the main autophagic adaptors that are classified as SLRs in response to bacterial and viral infections include p62, NBR1 (neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1), NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kDa) and optineurin [60],. the precise signal for capsid recognition by p62 is unclear. the precise signal for capsid recognition by p62 is independent of ubiquitin association. virophagy and mitophagy is critically determined by SMURF1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts as a bona fide mediator of selective autophagy. a number of studies have convincingly demonstrated that autophagy can influence the presentation of viral antigens on MHC-I and MHC-II [66] studies with HSV-1 showed that at early time points after infection, autophagy is not required for viral antigen processing and presentation of MHC-I peptides. however, it remains unknown how degradation of HSV-1 particles by the autophagosome results in the presentation of viral antigens. innate immune system is considered as the first line of defense against invading pathogens like viruses and bacteria. toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors are located either on the plasma membrane or within endosomal compartments. production of interferon- (IFN-) by VSV-infected pDCs depended on autophagic delivery of viral replication intermediates to TLR7 present on late endosomes. however, the exact mechanism by which viral PAMPs are selectively targeted by autophagosomes to the TLR-resident late endosomal compartment remains to be determined. autophagy is induced in a MyD88- and/or TRIF-dependent manner. Upon TLR activation, myD88 and TRIF directly interact with Beclin-1. this leads to the formation of beclin-1-Vsp34 complexes that induce autophagy. feedback loop may play an important role in autophagic sequestration and delivery of PAMPs to endosomal compartments. the role of SLRs in the selective autophagic degradation of viruses was recently studied in context of Sindbis virus infection [37]. the precise signal for capsid recognition by p62 is unclear, but is independent of ubiquitin association, because neurons of infected wild-type or Atg5-/- mice did not contain accumulation of ubiquitinated cellular or viral proteins. autophagy plays a major role in the adaptive immune response by processing and delivering antigens for presentation in complex with MHC-I and MHC-I molecules. a number of studies have convincingly demonstrated that autophagy can influence the presentation of viral antigens on MHC-I and MHC-II. autophagy was required for the consecutive delivery of antigens to MHC-II molecules, arguing for a crucial role of autophagy in MHC-II presentation of antigens in vivo. fusing the matrix protein of influenza virus to LC3 showed increased MHC-II activation of CD4+ T-cells, thus revealing an unexplored strategy for vaccine development. expression of the viral proteins 2BC and 3A resulted in the lipidation of LC3 and induced the formation of autophagosome-like DMVs. these properties are not unique for poliovirus, but have been found for several other picornaviruses such as CVB3, enterovirus 71 (EV71) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) s have been proposed provide a membrane platform for viral replication complexes. viruses can trigger selective autophagy to degrade either lipids (lipid droplets) for energy production during viral replication or to subvert immune responses. conflicting reports have been published as to the role of autophagy for the HCV replication cycle [23,26,79,80]. the authors describe the localization of HCV replicase proteins NS5A and NS5B as well as nascent HCV RNA to autophagosome-like structures. however, these data are in direct opposition to studies showing that HCV proteins do not colocalize with autophagosomes in infected cells. a recent study by heaton and co-workers identified a novel proviral mechanism of autophagy: the production of energy. this results in a mobilization of triglycerides that are used for ATP production via -oxidation. this results in a mobilization of triglycerides that are used for ATP production via -oxidation. HBsAg binds to and colocalizes with LC3-I and LC3-II during HBV infection or upon ectopic expression of HBsAg. the viral assembly protein Gag interacts with LC3-II. this association allows the processing of the Gag subunit p24. recent studies have confirmed the role of autophagy in the unconventional secretion of diverse substrates. IRGM interacted with the autophagy proteins Atg5, Atg10, MAP1CL3C and SH3GLB1 (SH3-domain GRB2-like endophilin B1). IRGM interacted with the autophagy proteins Atg5, Atg10, MAP1CL3C and SH3GLB1 (SH3-domain GRB2-like endophilin B1). this work revealed a primary role of IRGM in virus-induced autophagy. it identified a large range of RNA viruses that use common strategies to manipulate autophagy in order to promote viral replication. two recent studies provided insights as to how autophagy might promote HCV replication indirectly, namely by blocking the innate immune response. these structures stained positive for the viral protein 2BC and 3A. expression resulted in the lipidation of LC3 and induced the formation of autophagosome-like DMVs. these properties are not unique for poliovirus, but have been found for several other picornaviruses. autophagosomes have been proposed as a membrane platform for viral replication complexes. viruses can trigger selective autophagy to degrade lipids for energy production during viral replication or to subvert immune responses by selectively degrading key regulatory molecules. conflicting reports have been published as to the role of autophagy for the HCV replication cycle. authors describe the localization of HCV replicase proteins NS5A and NS5B as well as nascent HCV RNA to autophagosome-like structures. however, these data are in direct opposition to studies showing that HCV proteins do not colocalize with autophagosomes in infected cells. a recent study by heaton and co-workers identified a novel proviral mechanism of autophagy: the production of energy. this results in a mobilization of triglycerides that are used for ATP production via -oxidation. this results in a mobilization of triglycerides that are used for ATP production via -oxidation.
