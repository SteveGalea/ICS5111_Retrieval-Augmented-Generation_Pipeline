{"summary": "viral surveillance in wild bat populations has accelerated due to human fatalities and the socio-economic impacts of emerging infectious diseases with bat origins. shedding can act as an indicator of broader environmental change driving host population stress [9,10], which can influence disease dynamics through behavioural and physiological changes in the host. shedding can act as an indicator of broader environmental change driving host population stress [9,10], which can influence disease dynamics through behavioural and physiological changes. viridae, and Paramyxoviridae are diverse viral families infecting a wide range of vertebrates. key examples are the precursors to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses. adenoviruses of bat origin have not been associated with human disease outbreaks, but in-vitro experiments have demonstrated their capacity to infect other vertebrate cell lines. cross species infections of adeno ipaviruses, nor lyssaviruses were detected [30]. Currently, the pathogen\u2013host associations, and potential human risks or bat conservation implications remain relatively unknown. we screened faecal samples for the presence of adenoviruses, coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses. the south-western sites were predominantly within the Avon bioregion. the south-western sites were distributed across four bioregions. the north-eastern sites were predominantly within the Avon bioregion. screening of coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses consisted of a nested and semi-nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplifying a segment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) PAR-R PAR-F2 50 RES-MOR-HEN-F1 53 500 RES-MOR-HEN-F1 53 500 RES-MOR-HEN-R RES-MOR-HEN-F2 50 Reverse transcription PCR amplifications were performed using SuperScript III One-Step with Platinum Taq. additional PCRs were carried out with MyTaq PCR mix (Bioline, London, UK) contigs matching coronavirus and adenovirus sequences were extracted and examined manually by ORF prediction followed by BLASTn and BLASTp search. manual genome annotation was performed using Geneious v10.2.6 (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand), and subjected to BLASTn search. serology samples were tested for reactivity to four paramyxovirus and two betacoronavirus antigens in an indirect-binding Luminex\u00ae assay at a final working dilution of 1:50. the assay coupled soluble G (sG) glycoproteins from Hendra virus (HeV), Nipah virus (NiV) and Cedar virus (CedV), and nucleoproteins (N) from Tioman virus (TioV the threshold to differentiate positive and negative samples was set up at 1000 MFI, which is at least three times the mean MFI of negative sera. it is based on previous studies published by the AAHL and elsewhere using the same Bio-Plex platform on sera from other bat species with values below 250 MFI considered negative. the 14 sampling sites fell on the east and west boundaries of the wheatbelt. the south-western sites were distributed across four bioregions. the north-eastern sites were predominantly within the Avon bioregion. the supernatant was used as starting material for all extractions using a Magmax viral RNA extraction kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Vilnius, Lithuania) the supernatant consisted of a nested and semi-nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplifying a segment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) PLQ-R2 Paramyxovirus RNA polymerase gene (RdRp) PAR-F1 53 500 [35] PAR-R PAR-F2 50 RES-MOR-HEN-F1 53 500 RES-MOR-HEN-R RES-MOR-HEN-F2 50 Reverse transcription PCR amplifications were performed using SuperScript III One-Step with Platinum Taq. contigs were searched against the GenBank non-redundant protein database using DIAMOND v0.9 [38] and those returning significant similarity to viral sequences (E value 10-5) were retained. manual genome annotation was performed using Geneious v10.2.6 (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand) phylogenetic analyses for five whole coronavirus genomes constructed from NGS data were performed on the polyprotein 1ab and spike gene amino acid sequences. serology samples were tested for reactivity to four paramyxovirus and two betacoronavirus antigens in an indirect-binding Luminex\u00ae assay. the Luminex assay has not been validated for microbat species due to the lack of species-specific positive controls. the MFI threshold to differentiate positive and negative samples was set up at 1000 MFI. it is at least three times the mean MFI of negative sera. serology Resulting overall antibody prevalence estimates were generally low for all serology assays. highest values were observed for SARS-CoV at 5.8% (95% CI 4.3\u20137.9%) and CedV at 5.3% (95% CI 3.8\u20137.3%) and MERS-CoV at 1.5% (95% CI 0.8\u20132.7%). Species-specific antibody prevalence values were also low, with the highest value recorded for ceV antibodies in C. morio at 10.3% (95% CI 4.8\u201320.7%) and CoV antibodies in N. gouldi at 10% (95% CI 5.1\u201320%). 68(2) 3 (0.8\u201310) 68(4) 6 (2.3\u201314.2) 66(2) 3 (0.8\u201310.4) 68(2) 3 (0.8\u201310.1) 3\u20136 3 C. morio 60(5) 8.3 (3.6\u201318.0) 58(6) 10.3 (4.8\u201320.7) 59(0) 58(2) 3.3 (0.9\u201311.5) 59(4) 6.7 (2.6\u201316) 60(1) 1.6 (0.2\u20138.7) 3.3\u201310.3 1.6\u20136.7 F. mackenzie all viral families were predominantly amplified from four species, C. gouldii, C. morio, N. geoffroyi, and V. regulus. the former two species showed the highest prevalence estimates for adenovirus DNA and coronavirus RNA (CoV-RNA) C. gouldii, V. regulus and C. morio showed the greatest levels of CoV-RNA shedding. the corresponding CoV seoprevalence was only between 1.6% and 6.7%. the detection rate of co-infections was low and limited to a single. two different strains of coronavirus were detected in the SWBP. for adenoviruses, three strains were observed in C. gouldii and two in N. geoffroyi. a total of six full genomes were described: five coronaviruses and one adenovirus. denovirus genome was amplified from the sample marked by an orange circle. clades of reference samples were collapsed for brevity, black circles, and accession numbers are shown following strain names. most clades were dominated by strains detected from same species sampled at different locations. a single full-length adenovirus genome was obtained from a C. gouldii (Bat AdV WA 3301 Cg Dwe, clade IV, GenBank accession MK472072) the genome was 37,617 nucleotides in length, with inverted terminal repeats of 288 bp and 293 bp at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 termini. a BLASTn search on the full-length genome returned most similarity to each clade, WA CoV I and IV consisted predominantly of C. gouldii (n= 28, 24), WA CoV II of C. morio (n= 14), and WA CoV III of V. regulus (n= 16) a single sequence was amplified from Ozimops sp. clades also included highly similar sequences detected from a minority of other species. the Ozimops sp sequence clustered with a molossidae sequence (Chaerephon sp.

Clades identified in this study are coloured, naming convention represents the unique ID for each individual followed by the first letter of the genus, the first letter of the species and the geographical trapping site. geneBank accession numbers for representative sequences produced by this study are reported in Supplementary Table S1. most clades were dominated by strains detected from individuals of the same species sampled at different locations. clades were amplified from the sample marked by an orange circle. a single full-length adenovirus genome was obtained from a C. gouldii (Bat AdV WA 3301 Cg Dwe, clade IV, GenBank accession MK472072) the genome was 37,617 nucleotides in length, with inverted terminal repeats of 288 bp and 293 bp at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 termini. a BLASTn search on the full-length genome returned most similarity to clades included highly similar sequences detected from a minority of other species. strains from two Nyctophilus spp and one from V. regulus clustered with the 28 C. gouldii sequences within WA CoV I, two F. mackenziei and two V. barvestocki clustered within the V. regulus clade. the Ozimops sp sequence clustered with a molossidae sequence (Chaerephon sp. HQ728486) all the remaining clusters were most similar to sequences from members of vespertilionid bats. the genome representing clade CoV IV clustered with Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU10 (AFU92112). the genome representing clade CoV IV clustered with Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea virus (ALB08471) with an amino acid identity of 74.1% for the pp1ab region. two distinct sequences detected in V. regulus and C. gouldii clustered within the genus Shaanvirus. only one sample was successfully sequenced, and the resulting sequence clustered within Shaanvirus instead of Morbillivirus. we present a comprehensive characterisation of the viral diversity within Australian insectivorous bat communities. we provide the first records of adenovirus and paramyxovirus shedding in western Australian bats. our results indicate that disease burden varies within bat species assemblages, and C. gouldii appears to be a key epidemiological element. a partition between sites north and south of the wheatbelt was observed for coronavirus strains amplified from C. morio. phylogenetic analysis showed species-specific groups harboured a minority of identical or similar strains. previous cross-species infections of bats have been observed in cave-dwelling species that share roosting sites. phylogenetic analysis of spike protein from coronavirus genome showed a higher level of similarity to Porcine Endemic Diarrhoea virus (PEDV) this raises the possibility of a spillover risk, as the spike protein determines cell tropism. both SADS and HKU2 bat coronavirus share 86% identity across the spike protein gene. genome had low levels of identity to other available adenovirus genomes. a strong host\u2013strain association was also supported by the difference of the fiber protein, which determines cellular tropism, to other sequences in GenBank. serological results illustrate the challenges of sero-surveillance in novel species in the absence of a validated species-specific assay. a high prevalence of coronavirus RNA shedding suggests endemic infection of the studied communities. a high prevalence of coronavirus RNA shedding suggests endemic infection of the studied communities. pteropid bats were known reservoirs of the virus despite all being known. phylogenetic affinity has been suggested as an underlying factor of viral richness. the role of home range appears to be an important driver of viral richness. long-term monitoring of viral prevalence can act as an indicator of environmental pressure on bat communities. this approach would allow bat viral research to move beyond prediction of zoonotic disease emergence and be used as a management tool for monitoring the health of cryptic bat communities."}
