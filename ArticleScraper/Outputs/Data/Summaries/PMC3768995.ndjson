{"summary": "respiratory viruses are the most frequent cause of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in infants and young children, and important causes of hospitalization in developing countries. human syncytial virus (HRSV), Influenzavirus types A and B (FLUA and B), human parainfluenzavirus 1, 2 and 3 (HPIV 1, 2 and 3), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) have been recognized as the most important pathogens involved in lower infectious diseases dependencies are seen in correlations between disease rates and weather variations over weeks, months or years. knowledge of trends and seasonality of respiratory viral infections in the community could be a first step to confer information for health care providers. RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis Viral RNA was extracted from 250l of clinical specimen following the Trizol LS manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was synthesized using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). amplification was made by a semi-nested PCR method. the first step resulted in a final reaction volume of 50l. the reaction was preceded by a denaturation step at 95oC for 5 minutes. the first step resulted in a final reaction volume of 50l. 272 nasopharyngeal washes were collected from 272 children aged from1 to 68 months (average age of 29.5 months) from this total, 44.5% (121/272) were younger than 24 months and 57% were male. HRSV was the most detected consisting in 29% (79/272) from the positive samples. 61/121 28/121 7/121 28/121 (50.5%) (23.1%) (5.8%) (0.8%) (5.8%) (23.1%) total respiratory infections were detected between late winter and late spring 2004. 2005 occurred between early autumn and late winter, with outbreaks in autumn. a:Distribution of total respiratory infections according to climatic season. a: Viral respiratory infections between autumn/2004 to winter/2005. the influence of temperature and relative air humidity on the circulation pattern of respiratory viruses was evidenced by statistical analysis. results present a significant association between viral respiratory infections and monthly average of minimal relative air humidity (p=0.046) ARI accounts approximately for 20% of mortality in children up to 5 years old. despite advances in epidemiological knowledge of these infections, researches involving respiratory viruses features that circulate in countries as Brazil are still necessary. our results showed a significant association between viral respiratory infections and monthly average of minimal relative air humidity (p=0.046), and between monthly average of minimal temperature (p=0.044) meteorological aspects may present influence one over the other, occurring variations on temperature according to fluctuations on relative air humidity. climatic profiles could cause an improvement of viral particles dissemination, leading to a higher probability of infection. it is observed that there is a moderate fluctuation of temperature over the period of study (about 10 \u00b0 C) it was verified a statistical significant association (p=0.010) between HRSV identification and monthly average of minimal temperature, showing that in Southeast Brazil this virus presents a correlation to periods that temperatures are lower. the occurrence of these infections showed associations with the coldest and driest periods, represented by autumn, winter and spring seasons. however, the minimal temperatures are high when compared to those observed in countries of temperate climate where the seasonality is defined."}
