{"summary": "204 children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. the number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity, PICU admission, higher clinical score and longer hospital length of stay. the importance of viral co-infections in the pathogenesis, severity or course of respiratory infections is not well established. bacterial co-infection is usually associated with a more severe diseases course and worse prognosis, despite the precise interaction between bacteria and viruses is not always clear. no difference was found on the molecular diagnosis yield in our series. all investigators were trained in the study protocol for patient recruitment, sample processing and sample storage. the study was performed according to Good Clinical Practice. bacterial superinfection diagnosis was established according to the referring physician criteria. cases classified as bacterial co-infections included both cases with and without microbiological confirmation as in our series. eligible study participants were children under 14 years of age with a lower respiratory tract illness of sufficient severity to warrant admission to hospital. all types of LT-ARI were included, from bronchiolitis to pneumonia, with or without wheezing, fever, rhinorrhea and respiratory distress. the severity of each respiratory case was ranked as follows: physician criteria (mild, moderate or severe); wood-downes scale (0 to 10 points; mild 3, moderate 4\u20137, severe > 8); and a newly developed scale -named GENVIP score. bacterial superinfection diagnosis was established according to referring physician criteria, based on clinical data, inflammatory markers, and radiological findings. multiple regression models were considered using the significant risk factors obtained in the bivariate analysis and sex and age variables. a 2 test was performed to evaluate the correlation between bacterial superinfection and pneumococcal vaccine. infection1 56 (29.5) 53 (54.6) 0.001 Mono-infection1 95 (46.6) 56 (57.7) 0.084 RSV 53 (28.3) 21 (24.7) Rhinovirus 17 (9.1) 12 (14.1) Co-infection1 92 (49.2) 29 (34.1) 0.012 RSV + rhinovirus 23 (12.3) 3 (3.5) RSV+ bocavirus 10 (5.9) PICU admission1 38 (29.0) 43 (44.3) 0.024 female 36.9 1.287 0.405 1.069 0.838 51.5 1.228 0.657 1.14 0.802 (30.3, 43.6) (0.711, 2.340) (0.564, 2.014) (41.1, 62.0) (0.498, 3.086) (0.41, 3.18) Age 12\u201324 months 12.3 3.723 0.010 3.173 0.028 17.5 8.937 0.002 8.73 0.002 (7.8 16.8) (1.428, 10.955) (1 in the GENDRES cohort the presence of rhinovirus as co-pathogen was associated with a significantly increased Wood-Downes score by 1.289 points. the presence of rhinovirus as co-pathogen was associated with a significantly increased Wood-Downes score by 1.289 points (95% CI: 0.387, 2.192); P-value = 0.006.

Vaccinated patients had lower risk of being admitted to PICU in GENDRES cohort. PICU admission, disease severity according to different scales, need for respiratory support, and length of hospital stay followed a similar pattern in viral mono- versus co-infected children. bacterial superinfection increased the severity of the disease course, while pneumococcal vaccination played a protective role. co-infected children were almost three times more likely to be admitted to the PICU than those with single viral infections. there is contradictory evidence linking disease severity with specific respiratory viruses. a shorter hospital stay has been reported in children with rhinovirus bronchiolitis than with RSV. other studies did not find significant differences in severity between co-infection and single infection. bacterial superinfection increased most measures of severity in both cohorts. pneumococcal vaccine reduced the severity of viral LT-ARIs through a reduction in oxygen requirement, invasive and non-invasive ventilation. overestimated as diagnosis was accepted as true even without microbiological confirmation, just based on referring physicians\u2019 criteria. bacterial co-infection was associated with more severe disease, whereas pneumococcal vaccination decreased severity. future studies are needed to investigate whether particular viruses, or combinations of viruses, influence the risk of bacterial co-infection.
