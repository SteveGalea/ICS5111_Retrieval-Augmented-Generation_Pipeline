{"summary": "systems biology approaches are designed to facilitate the study of complex interactions between host and pathogen that determine disease outcome. a prerequisite for systems biology is the description of the system's components. genome structural annotation or the identification and demarcation of boundaries of functional elements in a genome are critical elements in infectious disease systems biology. bacterial genomes do not have introns, detecting gene boundaries is comparatively difficult. computational genome annotation methods may predict overlapping ORFs. arbitrary minimum cutoff lengths may filter short ORFs, which may lead to under-representation of small genes. the genome has 2065 computationally predicted genes, of which 1980 are protein coding. we sequenced the transcriptome of the H. somni strain 2336 using the alignment program Bowtie [20]. RNA-Seq data analysis workflow includes identification of novel protein coding genes and sRNAs in the intergenic region of the genome. expression in the intergenic region of the genome We compared the RNA-Seq based transcriptome map with the available genome annotation.

RNA-Seq technology has many advantages compared with existing array based methods for transcriptome analysis. a total of 95 sRNAs were identified in the H. somni genome. the 83 novel sRNAs may have housekeeping function, regulatory activity, or participate in virulence as described in other pathogenic bacteria [19], [35], [36] BLAST comparisons indicated that these genes have either nonsense or missense base changes relative to homologous genes in other bacterial species. RNA-Seq data enabled us to determine operon structures at a genome scale, and it allowed identification of some operons not predicted by the computational operon prediction method. RNA isolation and sequencing We propagated H. somni 2336 on three TSA-blood plates for 16 hr or until a fresh lawn of cells was visible. we washed the plates with brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and adjusted the culture to an OD620 nm = 0.8. the cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at 80\u00b0C. custom perl script was written to convert Illumina reads into fastq format. reads in sanger fastq format were mapped onto the Histophilus somni 2336 genome sequence. reads that mapped to more than one location were discarded. AST sequence searches were performed against the non-redundant protein database at NCBI to identify potential protein coding regions. sRNA sequence conservation among other genomes was determined by blastn searches against non-redundant nucleotide database at NCBI.

BLAST sequence searches were performed against the non-redundant protein database at NCBI to identify potential protein coding regions. intergenic regions within predicted operons [24] represent expressed regions and can be mis-classified as sRNAs. sRNA sequence conservation among other genomes was determined by blastn searches against non-redundant nucleotide database. the predicted protein coding frame (MH_748) is shorter at the 5\u2032 end than the corresponding transcript level shown by the RNA-Seq coverage. no start codon is found in that region which might be a result of the mutation in that region of the start codon."}
