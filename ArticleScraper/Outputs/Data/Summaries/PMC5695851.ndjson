{"summary": "Ubiquitin (Ub) is a 76-residue protein that is highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. it is covalently linked to the target protein via an isopeptide bond between its C-terminal Gly residue and an acceptor amino acid of the target protein substrate. ubiquitylation is a dynamic process that can be reversed by the action of enzymes known as Ub hydrolases, deubiquitinases or deubi viruses use various strategies to exploit Ub and Ub-like modifier pathways. some recruit host enzymes, while others encode their own ubiquitin ligases. a major challenge in this field remains to define and understand enzyme specificity and regulation. coded proteins, including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, are targets of the UPS in vitro and in vivo. the recombinant TYMV PRO/DUB domain involved in the proteolytic processing of the viral replication precursor protein [29\u201331] also displays a DUB activity that was able to rescue the viral polymerase from degradation [32]. a hydrophobic patch was used by the cleaving PRO to recognize the cleaved PRO. the complex also engaged several elements close to the active site. a loop in the cleaved PRO represents an insertion with respect to the closest OTU DUB relatives of TYMV PRO/DUB. two mutant versions of TYMV PRO/DUB designed to weaken PRO:PRO interactions were expressed and crystallized. the loop harboring the 865-GPP-867 motif is a highly mobile flap on the otherwise rigid PRO/DUB framework. this result is confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. crystals of C5 diffracting to beyond 2 resolution were obtained [38]. we therefore used these new data to solve the C5 structure by molecular replacement from WT PRO. non-hydrogen atoms 2437 2437 Macromolecules 2287 2287 Protein residues 288 293 RMS (bonds) 0.81 0.84 Ramachandran favored (%) 99 99 Ramachandran allowed (%) 0.69 1.0 Ramachandran outliers (%) 0 0 Rotamer outliers (%) 0.69 1.0 Clashscore 1.54 3.47 Average B-factor 38.65 35.77 Macromolecules (A / B / both) in molecule 'B', Pro866 moves by 9 to a position overhanging the catalytic cleft. this shift is less pronounced in molecule 'A', and the loop therefore reaches an intermediate position. temperature factors of the loop jump up in molecule 'A'. his869 and Cys783 also come significantly closer together. the large movement of the 865-GPP-867 motif observed in molecule 'B' is due to a distinct flexing of the tip of the beta sheet. in contrast, the conserved GPP motif changes very little. molecular dynamics simulations confirm the distinct GPP flap mobility and a link to active site organization. we used as starting model the previously published structure of wild type full-length TYMV PRO/DUB, with the GPP flap in open conformation [21]. Molecular dynamics simulations for TYMV PRO/DUB and structure-based flap mutants. 25-ns simulations performed in identical conditions for wild type PRO/DUB (A) and mutants D843A (B), G865A (C) and P866G/P867G (D) structure-based mutations in the mobile loop affect DUB enzymatic activity in vitro. mutants P866G/P867G, G865A and D843A all significantly alter the dynamics of the GPP flap. however, the loop harboring A843 does not act anymore as a spring to the GPP flap. only P867 comes into contact with L820 even in the most closed conformation. the most disruptive mutant is P866G/P867G (Fig 2D, middle) the most disruptive mutant is P866G/P867G (Fig 2D) three loop-targeting mutants display impaired DUB activity in vitro. the most drastic effect was observed for the mutant P866G/P867G. this mutant falls in the range of I847D, the most severely impaired. structure of PRO/DUB I847A confirms that loop zippering is a property of TYMV PRO/DUB. loops 864\u2013868 thus occupy the same positions in the I847A and C5 crystals, i.e. intermediate in 'A' and 'B' five molecules are displayed in surface representations for PRO/DUB wild type and molecules 'A' (middle) and 'B' (middle) of C5 (top) and 'B' (bottom, in cyan and sky-blue, respectively), all in the same orientation. the hydrophobic zipper is in red (P866, P867) and orange (L781, L820) the levels of 66K-Ub conjugates were assessed by co-expressing 66K in Arabidopsis cells in the presence of myc2-Ub. the catalytically inactive 98K-C783S was used as a control. mutants with a mild phenotype in the DUB in vitro assay (around 30%, see Table 2) all appeared to retain a significant amount of DUB activity in vivo. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected with p-66K, p-myc2-Ub, alone or together with p-98K, p-98K-C783S, p-98K-P866G/P867G, p-98K-G865A, p-98K-D843A, p-98K-I847A or p-98K-I847D as indicated. TYMV PRO activity was previously reported to be involved in the processing of the 206K replication protein precursor at two distinct sites. we used the approach previously described to assess the PRO activity of WT or mutated 98K. p-206K-C783S (encoding the viral 98K protein to serve as a protease) were transfected into Arabidopsis protoplasts. cleavage of 206K at the PROHEL site is obscured by the 98K produced in trans from p-98K. cleavage of the substrate was inhibited upon mutation of the catalytic C783 residue (lane 4) mutants assayed\u2014including P866G/P867G and I847D (lanes 5 and 9)\u2014retained the capability to process both the HELPOL and PROHEL cleavage sites. mutants affecting the I847 distant patch were designed to interfere with recognition of the Ub surface. mutants now provide very powerful tools to decouple the dual PRO and DUB activities of TYMV PRO/DUB. this allows specific assessment of the function of DUB activity in infected cells. mutations P866G/P867G, G865A, D843A, I847A and I847D were introduced into the plasmid E17, which contains a full-length copy of the TYMV genome. in vitro transcripts were transfected into Arabidopsis protoplasts as indicated and cells were harvested 48 hpt. mutants P866G/P867G and I847D showed the lowest levels of DUB activity in vitro and in vivo. mutants I847A, G865A and D843A were found to replicate at levels of 60\u201380% that of WT RNA. both the DUB enzymatic activity and the conformation of the GPP flap influence viral RNA accumulation and symptoms appearance. idopsis thaliana plants were mechanically inoculated with water, or in vitro transcripts as indicated. the ability of the transcripts to multiply in systemic leaves was assessed by extracting total RNAs and quantifying viral genomic RNA by RTqPCR at 17 dpi. mutations in the distant patch involved in Ub recognition, I847A and I847D, led to the appearance of symptoms which were comparable to those caused by WT transcripts. however, the symptoms caused by the mutants affected in the GPP flap looked notably different. the mutants induced the appearance of necrotic local lesions on the inoculated leaves. I847A and I847D mutants caused symptoms similar to WT infection. mutants G865A and D843A caused extremely dissimilar symptoms. symptom severity seems to correlate with conformation adopted by the GPP flap. two superimposed phenomena most likely contribute to the observed variations in viral RNA accumulation and appearance of symptoms. the conformation of the GPP flap, whose opening/closure may impact the severity of symptoms, culminating in the appearance of local necrotic lesions restricting viral infection in the case of the P866G/P867G mutant. 202 (3525) Multiplicity 3.6 (3.2) 3.7 (3.5)

packing. we therefore have two independent views of PRO/DUB not engaged as a substrate in a PRO:PRO complex. the displacement of P866 in the zipper is indicated by a blue arrow. the displacement of P866 in the zipper is indicated by a blue arrow as in panel (A) TYMV PRO/DUB is a rigid molecule but harbours a very mobile loop. it can shift the GPP flap at its tip with its atypical double cis-proline. the flap quickly closes to a conformation superimposable with the 'A' molecules. the corresponding distances in the crystal structures are indicated as \"open\" and \"closed\" these results confirm that the new structures complete the range of conformations accessible to the GPP flap. the 'A' molecule best represents the PRO/DUB conformation when it neither is engaged as a substrate nor acts as a peptidase. ated residues' side chains are displayed as sticks, as well as L820. hydrogens added for the simulations are omitted. the dotted-and-broken line signals a 3.2 value below which the activating hydrogen bond is formed. mutants P866G/P867G, G865A and D843A all significantly alter the dynamics of the GPP flap. the loop harboring A843 does not act anymore as a spring to the flap. at first sight, the flap remains closed much longer, but also at times opens wider, than in the wild type. the catalytic dyad's dynamics are much less affected in the two other mutants. these flap-interfering mutations were first introduced into the recombinant His-tagged PRO/DUB domain of TYMV. these flap-interfering mutations were then measured in vitro using the general DUB substrate ubiquitin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC) TYMV PRO/DUB proteins Kapp (% of WT) WT 100 P866G/P867G 3.5 0.4 G865A 32 2 D843A 28 2 I847A 22 4 I847D 1.7 0.1 DUB activity of recombinant PRO was measured by a fluorescence assay using Ub-AMC. residues 732\u2013876 are ordered in I847A molecule 'A' and residues 732\u2013876 in I847A molecule 'B' loops 864\u2013868 thus occupy the same positions in the I847A and C5 crystals, i.e. intermediate in 'A' and zipped up in 'B' in vivo assays reveal that mutants are specifically affected in DUB but not PRO activity. 98K protein encompassing the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is the sole identified substrate of the 98K DUB activity to date [32]. mutants in the hydrophobic zipper (P866G/P867G) and the distant patch mutant (I847D) both displayed a drastic decrease in their DUB activity in vivo. this is true whether we consider loop-affecting mutants (G865A and D843A, lanes 7\u20138) or distant patch mutant (lane 9) the amount of 66K present in the immunoprecipitates was determined by immunoblotting with anti-66K antibody. the amount of 98K derivatives present in the cell lysates was determined by immunoblotting with anti-98K antibody prior to immunoprecipitation. the shorter 85K protein corresponds to a nonspecific degradation product of 98K occurring during sample extraction and protein analysis. 98K can process both cleavage sites in trans [31]. the expression plasmid p-206K-C783S (encoding the viral 98K protein to serve as a protease) were transfected into Arabidopsis protoplasts. processing at the HELPOL and PROHEL cleavage sites of the 206K substrate was assayed by immunoblotting of the corresponding protein samples. protein 206K corresponds to the substrate protein, 66K and 98K to its mature cleavage products. the shorter 85K protein corresponds to a nonspecific degradation product of 98K occurring during sample extraction and protein analysis [31] each mutant was analyzed in two independent experiments. mutants of TYMV PRO/DUB with various levels of DUB activity impairment were introduced into the plasmid E17. mutations P866G/P867G, G865A, D843A, I847A and I847D were introduced into the plasmid E17, which contains a full-length copy of the TYMV genome. in vitro transcripts were transfected into Arabidopsis protoplasts. the ability of the transcripts to replicate was assessed by extracting total RNAs and quantifying viral genomic RNA by RTqPCR. the relative accumulation of viral mutant RNAs as compared to the WT TYMV RNA is represented as the mean +/- SD. each mutant was analyzed in two independent experiments. mutants I847A, G865A and D843A with in vitro DUB activities of 30% of that of WT enzyme were found to replicate at levels of 60\u201380% that of WT viral RNA. only fully mature viral proteins were detected in infected cells, thus ruling out possible impact of partially impaired cleavage of 206K on viral infectivity. the same type and severity of symptoms were consistently observed in at least four independent experiments involving n 26 plants. the ability of the transcripts to multiply was assessed by extracting total RNAs and quantifying viral genomic RNA by RTqPCR at 17 dpi. the e17-G865A mutant also showed a peculiar phenotype. the local lesions on the inoculated leaves were originally chlorotic. however, around 15\u201317 dpi, the chlorotic areas became necrotic. a systemic necrosis phenotype led to leaf loss. mutations I847A and I847D were not mutated in their GPP flap. all mutants except E17-P866G/P867G were detected. levels of viral RNA accumulation of each mutant in planta were in good match with those observed in protoplasts. we also noted the insertion of a loop, directly upstream of the catalytic His869, with a striking 865-GPP-867 motif. the two successive prolines in this motif were found to both assume a cis conformation. we compared these features with the general organization and flexibility of OTU DUBs in this region. the top panel is the view from the P' side with residues bridging the hydrophobic constriction as sticks and labeled. the free enzyme is displayed on the left, and the complex on the right. in complexes, Ub is in grey with its C-terminal residues 73-LRGG-76 as sticks. the only exception is the third catalytic residue (here N263) that comes from a neighbouring strand. on the P side, i.e. the side that binds the C-terminal glycines 75-GG-76 thread, there is a constricted cleft with a conserved tryptophan. the canonical OTU DUB feature of a stable hydrophobic P side constriction is replaced in TYMV PRO/DUB by a removable flap. the flap is seen assuming what can be assigned to three discrete positions with the same locked bulge made of two cis-prolines. interfering with the dynamics between conformations affects DUB activity, but not PRO activity. other (+)RNA viruses encoding PRO/DUBs evolved endoprotease cleavage sites that better match the Ub C-terminus. the coV PRO/DUBs belong to the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family [44]\u2014enzymes with different folds than OTU DUBs, but with superimposable catalytic triads [35]. catalytic cysteine and histidine are brought close enough for side chains to interact. this is a known form of regulation for cellular DUBs, where a mobile loop may lead to the realignment of the catalytic site residues from an inactive to an active configuration. however, the TYMV PRO/DUB active site is still an outlier among DUBs. the peculiarly mobile catalytic dyad of the TYMV PRO/DUB active site may reflect a need to be further stabilized and/or completed by binding of partners. this too is a well known layer of regulation for cellular DUB activity in several DUB families. mutants of the distant patch centered on I847 are selectively defective in DUB activity. Ile847 patch mutants lack a PRO activity phenotype. this distant patch is also used by the cleaving PRO to recognize the cleaved PRO. patch disruption impairs DUB activity and could lead to the uncoupling of PRO/DUB dual activities. vage products were occasionally detected for 98K mutants in the PRO trans-cleavage assays. the possible contribution of partially impaired 206K cleavage to the viral replication deficiency was ruled out by the analysis of viral replication proteins produced upon infection. a similar effect of DUB activity impairment on viral RNA accumulation was also observed in whole plants. if TYMV DUB activity contributes to the assembly and/or regulation of the membranous spherule-like structures that host the TYMV replication complexes [54] remains to be determined. it is also possible that other, as yet unidentified, substrates of TYMV PRO/DUB may contribute directly or indirectly to the replication deficiency of TYMV mutants. resistance (R) gene-mediated defense responses trigger a range of fast and multilayered defense responses against viral infection. this specific recognition triggers a range of fast and multilayered defense responses, including massive ion fluxes, production of reactive oxygen species and changes in hormonal balance. both responses share similar phenotype and molecular features. ation of the GPP loop would be strong enough to induce HR and restrict the infection to the viral entry point. part-time or weaker interactions with G865A would induce systemic necrosis. future experiments will aim at characterizing those processes in more details. uncoupled, provide excellent tools for further study of the role of DUB in viral pathogenicity. TYMV PRO/DUB is mobile, and its closure restores the OTU DUB hydrophobic constriction on the P side of the active site. the GPP flap is mobile, and its closure restores the OTU DUB hydrophobic constriction on the P side of the active site. we compared these features with the general organization and flexibility of OTU DUBs in this region. we also included human DUBs of the OTUD subfamily, which are closest to TYMV PRO/DUB (DALI Z-scores [41] of 7 to 8) and one of which (OTUD2) is available in both free and Ub-bound forms. a snapshot at t = 24 ns from the molecular dynamics simulation of the wild type molecule was used here. the snapshot represents the typical equilibrium conformation where the GPP flap is in the intermediate position and the catalytic dyad realigned. for clarity, hydrogens added for the simulation are omitted. cleft is a residue that is variable among OTU DUBs. the TYMV PRO/DUB GPP flap mobility allows reversible restoration of the canonical OTU DUB physico-chemical layout on the P side of the catalytic cleft. the TYMV GPP flap is an insertion not found in other OTU DUBs. the active site may be tailored to allow a relaxed endoprotease sequence specificity. other (+)RNA viruses encoding PRO/DUBs evolved endoprotease cleavage sites that better match the Ub C-terminus. triads have evolved insertion of a mobile loop upstream of the catalytic histidine. the rigid and conserved TYMV GPP flap is a long and non-conserved flexible loop that contacts the Ub R74 residue rather than its C-terminal di-glycine [43]. the TYMV GPP flap closing only partially restores a normal papain-like active site. MV PRO/DUB active site is still an outlier among DUBs. the catalytic cysteine remains unusually exposed on the P' side. the third residue of the papain-like catalytic triad is also missing. mutants of the distant patch centered on I847 are selectively defective in DUB activity. however, the peculiar GPP loop of Tymoviridae is actually a flap involved in switching from PRO to DUB activity. we conclude that loop mobility allows alternative recognition of different sequences on the P side, and likely (in)activation of the catalytic site itself. TYMV remains unique to date as an example of the contribution of a viral DUB activity to viral replication in infected cells. traces of intermediate cleavage products were occasionally detected for 98K mutants in the PRO trans-cleavage assays. a similar effect of DUB activity impairment on viral RNA accumulation was also observed in whole plants. genus [49] and mutations dissociating the PRO and DUB activities of the OTU PRO/DUB domain of EAV arterivirus. this unique feature of TYMV PRO/DUB may be related to the fact that, in contrast to other viral-encoded DUBs described so far, TYMV PRO/DUB does not possess a general deubiquitylating activity. mutations affecting the GPP flap had a severe impact on the appearance of symptoms in planta. those ranged from mild chlorosis in the D843A mutant to local and systemic necrosis in the P866G/P867G mutant and the G865A mutants. the symptoms occurring during compatible infections represent the final outcome of complex biochemical and physiological perturbations occurring upon replication and spread of the virus. otype and molecular features, and systemic necrosis are thought to be caused by incomplete resistance. differences in symptoms severity among the various DUB mutants do not correlate with the DUB activity per se. the mutants appeared unable to properly close their zipper and remained in an \"open\" position. the TYMV mutants described herein, in which PRO and DUB activities are uncoupled, provide excellent tools for further study of the role of DUB in viral pathogenicity. the TYMV mutants described herein provide excellent tools for further study of the role of TYMV PRO/DUB in viral pathogenicity. bacterial expression vector encoding the WT PRO/DUB domain of TYMV (residues 728\u2013879 of 206K protein) mutants
