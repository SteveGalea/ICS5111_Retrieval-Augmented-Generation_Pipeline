{"summary": "the incidence of HAdV infection peaked in children aged 3\u20137 years. the most common clinical diagnosis was upper respiratory infection, and the most common syndrome was fever and cough. HAdV is responsible for 5\u201310% of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children. occurrence of fatal outcomes and chronic pulmonary sequelae associated with HAdV infection has been reported frequently. HAdV infections can occur endemically throughout the year or in epidemics. adenovirus was shown to arise from a hexon recombination between AdV11 and AdV14 [11] this outbreak prompted us to review HAdV-associated ARTIs in Lanzhou City, China. the aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of HAdV ARTIs over a period of 3 years. PCR was performed under the following conditions: 94\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 45 s, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. all positive PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 1169 children with ARTIs in the first hospital of Lanzhou University, Gansu Province, china. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers with Superscript II RH- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) PCR was performed under conditions: 94\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 68\u00b0C for 5 min, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. all positive PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) the ages of the children with ARTIs ranged from 1 day to 168 months. the vast majority of patients (90.95%) were 5 years old. 74 of 1169 (6.33%) specimens were positive for HAdV. HAdVs were detected in every month except May to October 2007, February and August 2008, and August, October, and November 2009. no HAdV outbreak was identified in Lanzhou City, China, during 2006\u20132009. 0\u2013 334 11 3.29% 14.86% 7\u2013 184 12 6.52% 16.21% 12\u2013 308 18 5.84% 24.32% 36\u2013 250 25 10.00% 33.78% >84 93 8 8.60% 10.81% total 1169 74 6.33% 100% Clinical characteristics of HAdVs infection in children. mixed infections 40 (68.97) 4 (40) 1 (16.67) 45 (60.81) Clinical manifestations Cough 38 (65.52) 9 (90) 2 (33.33) 49 (66.22) Wheezing 15 (25.86) 2 (20) 1 (16.67) 18 (24.32) Fever > 38\u00b0C 42 (70.69) 5 (50) 5 (83.33) 52 (67.57) Crackles 21 (36.21) 7 (70) 0 (0) 28 (37.84) Final diagnosis Upper respiratory tract infection 26 adenovirus (HAdVs) and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) groups were used in children with acute respiratory tract infections. adenovirus (HAdVs) and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) groups were used in children with acute respiratory tract infections. adenovirus (HAdVs) group (n = 58) group (n = 88) p. for 25% (10/40) of the patients, WBC counts were >10 109 leukocytes/L. overall hospitalization rate was 51.35% (38/74), with a median stay of 12.75 (range, 3\u201336) days. the vast majority of patients were 5 years old. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 5.05. Reference strains for different HAdV genotypes, Fowl adenovirus, Canine adenovirus and Bovine adenovirus are obtained from GenBank and marked. the ratio of males to females was 2:1. Table 1).

HAdV types 3 and 7 are also two of the most important etiological agents of pneumonia in china. recombination between AdV11 and AdV14 was found in our AdV11 isolates. HAdV was detected most commonly in children aged 3\u20137 years (10.00%) and the majority of cases were 5 years old. in the present study, HAdVs infection was also found in 11 infants younger than 6 months. this result is in contrast to that of a previous study from Taiwan. LRTIs caused by HAdV are mild and indistinguishable from LRTIs caused by other respiratory viruses. but HAdV can result in fatal outcomes or residual sequelae. symptoms manifested during infection with AdV3 and AdV7 have become less severe since the mid-1980s. of the 10 AdV-11 positive samples, only one was successfully amplified for the whole 3449 bp long hexon gene. it is difficult to identify the other nine AdV11-positive samples as AdV55 by the short fragment of the hexon gene. this novel recombinant AdV55 needs further study to explore its clinical significance. authors\u2019 contributions Rong-fang Zhang carried out RT-PCR, virus detection and sequencing studies.
