{"summary": "the PRRSV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with two distinct genotypes namely European and North American. the common symptoms to PRRSV infection has been characterized by prolonged viremia, a deficient induction of innate immunity along with weak and delayed development of neutralizing antibodies. this is the major hurdle for control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. host immune response to PRRSV is comprised of a complex interplay between components of the innate and adaptive immune system. adaptive immunity represents the neutralizing antibody response usually developed at 2\u20134 weeks following antigenic stimulation. other potential effectors are cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) that may limit spread of infectious agents by recognizing and killing infected cells. the peripheral blood samples are much preferred to respiratory tissues/cells. repeated blood sampling is possible from the same individual during the course of immune responses, which is especially useful in controlling the baseline variation. the whole in-vivo experiment was conducted according to the institutional guidelines and animal husbandry regulations of Germany [28] piglets were immunized with the commercially available live PRRSV vaccine of European strain (Porcilis\u00ae PRRS, MSD Animal Health, Germany) plasma was aspirated from the upper most layers and kept at 20\u00b0C until used. PBMCs were carefully aspirated and treated with RBC lysis buffer. plasma samples from all animals collected at day 7, 28, 42, 56 and 70 of age were screened by ELISA. the total RNA from three individual piglets collected at D0, D1 and D28 time points were used for preparing the target probes for nine microarrays. about 100 ng of total RNA were processed to synthesize the biotin-labeled sense strand cDNA (ss-cDNA) probes using the GeneChip WT PLUS Reagent kit (P/N 902281; Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to differential gene expression analysis was performed using the linear analysis of microarray technique from the \u2018limma\u2019 package. two pairwise contrasts such as D1 vs. D0 and D28 vs. D0 were considered for differential gene expression associated with the innate and the adaptive immune response. highly expressed, cell specific (HECS) gene database comprises of 10,058 genes of human and mouse origin. for this analysis, human orthologus symbol of differentially expressed genes were uploaded and compared with human HECS database. enrichment score estimated as log10 of the BH-adjusted P value. RT-qPCR reaction was set up taking 1.0 l of cDNA template, 8.0 l of deionized RNase free water, 0.5 l of upstream and downstream primers and 10 l iTaqTM Universal SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix. all reactions were amplified in duplicate by the StepOnePlusTM Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems\u00ae, Darmstadt, Germany) the whole in-vivo experiment was conducted according to the institutional guidelines and animal husbandry regulations of Germany. the blood sampling protocol was approved by the state agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. about 7 mL anti-coagulated venous blood samples were collected repeatedly at day 7, 28, 42, 56 and day 70 of age. the blood samples collected at just before (D0), and one day (D1) and 28 days (D28) relative to the primary vaccination were used with three biological replications. RNA extraction and microarray hybridization Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs using the miRNeasy mini kit (P/N 217004, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the RNA integrity was checked by micro capillary electrophoresis on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser with RNA 6000 Nanochip kit (Agilent Technologies, Wagh\u00e4usel\u2014Wiesental, Germany) the hybridized chips were stained and washed in a fluidics station. the image data were evaluated using Affymetrix Genechip command consol (AGCC) software. the intensity data were exported into.CEL file format. innateDB platform implements the hypergeometric algorithm with the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) multiple test correction method for overrepresentation analysis. GO, pathways and TFBS were considered significantly over-represented with an FDR 0.05. nodes having higher degree and betweenness values are potential network hubs regulating cellular signal trafficking. weighted network based module detection was performed to stratify interconnected genes of similar biological function. RT-qPCR validation Four selected differentially expressed genes are known to be involved in immune response. the delta Ct (Ct) values were calculated as the difference between target gene and the average of reference genes. the relative expression was calculated as 2(-Ct) [40] piglets were negative for maternally derived antibody at the time of primary vaccination. the PRRSV vaccine-specific antibody response was appeared at 14 days (day 42 of age) post priming followed by a significantly (P 0.001) increased titre at 28 days (day 56 of age) post priming. a total of 14,212 gene transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in PBMCs following vaccination. the array chip was embedded with probe sets of 19,218 known genes in total. a total of 295 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed at day one post vaccination compared to control. Fig 3) of the FDR sorted top ten altered genes indicated that CXCR2, IFNG, SMAD3, VNN1, F2R and GZMB genes were most significantly upregulated. the range of log fold change of DEGs was between 2.51 and 4.50. the picture demonstates the range of fold changes of most significantly altered transcripts in connection to adaptive immune response in PBMCs. the gene ontology analysis revealed that vaccine induced differentially expressed genes are involved in the process of active cellular process (Table 3). there were significantly altered transcripts participating in cellular activation and differentiation, protein metabolism and gene expression (eg, GO:0010628), antigen processing and presentation (eg, GO:0019882).

Fig 6. Transcription factors binding sites of DEGs. the figure depicts the TFBS of the genes showing differential expression in PBMCs at one day after vaccination (A) differential expression of transcriptomes was found to be significantly contributed by innate immune cell types including CD56+ NK cells, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. NK cells was the enriched cell type associated with innate immunity but not with adaptive immunity in PBMCs. thymus, CD14+ and whole blood sample cell types were enriched in connection to adaptive immune response. the majority of core genes of the network were overexpressed in PBMCs following PRRSV vaccination indicated the upregulation of their underlying function. differentially expressed genes were clustered in four modules (IM0, IM1, IM2 and IM3) indicated by four different colors. each circle indicates the node or member genes of the network. blue module (IM1) containing genes such as STAT3, TGF\u00df1, APP, DUSP1, ELAVL1DDX39B, MYL12A, EP300, IKBKB, IKBKG, RBM8A, SP1, EGFR, TRPC4A and CEBPB. genes altogether involved in biological functions like myD88:Mal cascade initiated on plasma membrane, toll-like receptors cascades, signaling by interleukins, NFk purple module (AM0) containing genes ILR7, TGF\u00df1, SP1, IL-10, EP300, IFNG, EGR1, STAT3, TPM2, LEF1, IRF1 and are biologically linked to cytokine signaling in immune system. blue module (AM1) containing gene GZMA, GZMB, HIST2H2BE, XRCC6, XRCC6 and JUN, was involved in biological function like cohesin loading onto chromat the larger diameter indicates the higher potential of the nodes to be the hub genes of the network. the network modules with corresponding genes are indicated by different colors (purple: AM0, blue: AM1, pink: AM2, green: AM3 and yellow: AM4) the RT-qPCR validation of the microarray data. a higher number of replicates in the microarray experiment would lead more statistical power, thereby more robust results. we compared the global transcriptome profiles of PBMCs collected at day one (D1) and day 28 (D28) post PRRSV vaccination with that of before vaccination (D0) from the same pigs to characterize the immune responses to PRRSV. RNA-seq analysis also revealed the global down regulation of altered transcripts in the PRRSV infected lung dendritic cells obtained from Pietrain pigs. overexpression of IL8 and CCR7 indicated that PRRSV vaccine is able to induce a proinflammatory response in PBMCs. the development of anti-viral innate immunity launches through sensing the viral protein or nucleic acid by the so-called specific receptors. a gradual development of the interferon-gamma response to PRRSV infection has been reported in pigs. a strong elevation of IFN-\u00df at 9 h post infection but a slightly elevated expression of IFN was observed in alveolar macrophage infected with PRRSV. a total of 27 differentially expressed genes were under regulation. ANGPT2, IFNG, PLAC8 and TGFB1 are potential target genes of MYC transcription factor. the innate immune regulator, CD47 (Cluster of Differentiation 47) regulates the expression of two immune checkpoint proteins on the tumor cell surface. the adaptive immune checkpoint, PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) initiates and maintains the tumorigenesis. ratios of CD4+/CD8+ T cells were significantly lower between day 3 and 28 post-inoculation compared with that of day 0. reduced innate NK-cells population along with increased frequencies of CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cells and myeloid cells resulted from PRRSV infection in pigs. functional network encodes p56 (LCK), a non receptor protein-tyrosine kinase of the SRC oncogene family. the signal transduction cascades are activated following antigen binding to the TCR. ubiquitination was found to be a key cellular processes significantly upregulated with the transcriptome alteration in PBMCs after PRRSV vaccination. adaptive immunity is specific to the pathogen and the components of the adaptive immune system are also likely contributing to PRRSV resistance in pigs. adaptive immunity is likely to be predominated by B cell function, however, T lypmhocytes in parallel also have significant contribution in adaptive immunity. type 1 PRRSV strains have been reported to induce IL-10 production in infected dendritic cells. induction of neutralizing antibody (NAb) response is a potential indicator for vaccine-based adaptive immunity. however, the specificity as well as the level of NAb titre may vary and are likely attributed to establishment of protective immunity. a model in which PBMCs transcriptome alterations are involved in upregulation of CD28 dependent VAV1 pathway. upregulation of IL12-mediated signaling events, AP-1 transcription factor network and TGF-beta receptor signaling pathways at 28 days after PRRSV vaccination in pigs. further work is required to determine whether polymorphisms linked to genes identified in this study affect the innate immune response trait in pig populations immunized with PRRSV vaccine. list of differentially expressed genes in porcine PBMCs associated with adaptive immunity."}
