{"summary": "HCV is a positive-strand RNA virus encoding a single polyprotein precursor [1] that is generated by RNA translation at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) this polyprotein is proteolytically processed into 10 mature proteins in a preferential, but not obligatory order. of these, p7 separates the structural proteins (i.e., Core and the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2) from the nonstructural proteins that save for NS2 are initial attempts to ascribe distinct function(s) of p7 to the viral life cycle were complicated by the lack of adequate cell culture models to propagate HCV in cultured cells. the initial development of a self-replicating subgenomic replicon demonstrated that the structural proteins and p7 were dispensable for viral RNA replication. viroporins are formed by a growing family of viral proteins identified in RNA and DNA viruses. they share common features such as their small size, hydrophobicity, the presence of at least one amphiphatic transmembrane domain and the cytopathogenicity. deletion of viroporin coding sequence reduces production of infectious virus particles and the pathogenicity. HCV p7 topology and structure Based on protein structure and membrane topology, two major classes (I and II) and two subclasses (a and b) of viroporins have been defined. a third class including viroporins with three hydrophobic domains has been also proposed. studies using transmission EM (TEM) and computer-based image analysis revealed that p7 fusion proteins form a mix of hexameric and heptameric complexes in liposomes. results obtained with equilibrium sedimentation experiments of p7 were consistent with the formation of different p7 oligomeric states comprising 6 1 subunits. in biological membranes p7 might exist as a mixture of oligomers with variable size. a schematic representation of the membrane topology of HCV p7 Gt1b (HCV-J) as deduced from the NMR structure is shown in the right [35] -helices proposed for each structure are indicated. p7 monomers (in purple and blue) were fitted into the flower-shape map with their N- and C-termini oriented to the petal tips. heptameric model of p7 of the Gt1b HCV isolate J4 deduced from NMR data. p7 sequences from representative Gts, including p7 of the two strains displayed in (A) and (C) are highlighted; (C) Multiple alignment of p7 sequences from representative Gts. a cytosolic loop separates the first transmembrane region from the second. in all Gt1b structures a cytosolic loop separates the first transmembrane region from the second one. p7 appears to be a flexible protein as supported by structural differences. it is unclear why the p7 monomer from Gt5a presents an unusual and distinct conformation. this structure represents the first example in which the conformation of p7 subunits was extracted from a NMR-based hexameric complex. it reveals three alpha helical regions tilted with sharp angles and adopting a curved \u201cstaple-like\u201d conformation. hexameric architecture stabilized by multiple interactions between monomers. the third C-terminal helix (H3) of one monomer interacts with the second helix (H2) of the neighboring monomer and with the first N-terminal helix (H1) of the consecutive one. this complex rearrangement of subunits might evoke a process of co-folding, at least under the in vitro conditions used during protein \u201crenaturation\u201d in presence of DPC. models for hexameric or heptameric p7 channels from Gt1a, 1b and 2a have been obtained by molecular dynamics using either predicted or NMR-based structures of the corresponding monomers inserted into lipid bilayers. in these studies p7 bundles display a luminal orientation of the first TMD with the C-terminal TM region facing the membrane hydrophobic phase and surrounding the channel. p7 of different HCV Gts forms homo-oligomers of heterogeneous size in vitro. the existence of such a mixture of p7 species in infected hepatocytes remains to be determined. the biochemical characterization of p7 complexes forming in infected cells should allow to determine the physiological relevance of the structures/conformations proposed for the p7 monomer. HB selectively enters cells with enhanced membrane permeability and inhibits protein synthesis. this approach has been invaluable to study the viroporin function of many family members. however, whether the entry of HB into cells occurs directly via viroporin-assembled pores at the cell surface or indirectly by upregulation of endocytosis. the functional resemblance of HCV p7 with the M2 viroporin of influenza A virus (IAV) and their common acid-activated proton channel activity suggests that both viroporins might share a similar gating mechanism for protons. a role for Phe25 as \u201cgate\u201d residue has been suggested from liposome-based assays. cation channel activity has not been proven for Gt5a p7. mutations of amino acids at equivalent positions (Arg35; His9) decreased cation channel activity. additional channel structures of p7 will be required to elucidate whether Phe25 and Ile32 of p7 function as gate residues. p7 acts as a low pH-activated channel in HCV-infected cells. p7 acts as a low pH-activated channel by equilibrating the proton gradient across the membrane of acidic compartments. mutations are associated with delayed cleavage of the E2-p7-NS2 precursor. p7 ion channel may be regarded as modulator of pH-mediated maturation process of HCV particles. p7 also interacts with apolipoproteins which are integral component of infectious virions. p7 also interacts with the envelope glycoproteins. p7/NS2 association has been shown to dictate the relocalization of core from LDs to ER in infected cells. a recent study of the interaction network of HCV proteins has pointed to core and the two envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 as new direct binding partners of p7. a block in envelopment would prevent nucleocapsid assembly, concomitant with an intracellular accumulation of core protein on the surface of LDs and of the envelope glycoproteins in the vicinity of assembly sites. studies of p7 dibasic motif mutants revealed a Gt-dependent reduction of intracellular infectivity, likely resulting from incomplete incorporation of viral RNA into nucleocapsids. p7 channel as antiviral drug target A number of compounds have been reported to exert an inhibitory effect on HCV p7 channel activity. these include classic inhibitors of the IAV M2 viroporin, such as the adamantanes, amantadine and rimantadine, iminosugar derivatives (e.g., N-nonyl deoxynojirimycin,NN-DNJ), hexamethylamiloride (H inhibition of -glucosidases, leading to altered glycosylation pattern and total level of HCV E2, might be a mechanism adding to the direct binding and inhibition of p7 [13,24]. however, it has recently been reported that productive HCV release is linked to inhibition of acidification of virus-containing compartments mediated by p7 and this process is blocked by adamantanes and HMA [58] resistance against these novel p7 inhibitors has not been reported. clinical development of p7 inhibitors has met limited success. no clinical benefit of amantadine-based combination therapy was found in comparison to standard of care (peg-IFN plus ribavirin) BIT225 may be suitable for treatment of HCV/HIV co-infected patients. clinical niche of p7 inhibitors is unclear. p7 inhibitors are not an exception. the p7 homo-hexamer structure is different from the typical hairpin conformation. it proposes a novel gating mechanism for the p7 ion channel. chronic hepatitis C might be considered a solved problem."}
