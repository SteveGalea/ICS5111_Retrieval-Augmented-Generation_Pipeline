{"summary": "smallpox is a category A bioterrorism agent, despite being declared eradicated in 1980[1]. the virus is retained in high security biosafety level 4 laboratories in the united states and Russia [2]. the variola genome is fully sequenced and could be synthesized in a laboratory [3], thus highlighting the feasibility of de novo synthesis of smallpox. studies of smallpox re-emergence often assume health systems to be functioning and investigate only the role of vaccination on epidemic control [13\u201316] there is a need to determine requirements for surge capacity within health systems in the event of re-emergent smallpox. we aimed to determine hospital bedcapacity for isolation, public health workforce capacity for contact tracing and health care worker personal protective equipment requirements. the population moves through the disease compartmental epidemiological states of being susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered (SEIR) once infected, people move into the next state following disease duration rates. different infectivity levels were based on the reproduction number for hemorrhagic, flat, ordinary and modified smallpox as previously described. initial infected 100, 1000, 10000 Hospital bed requirements We estimate the number of hospital beds in Sydney using data published for 2015\u20132016 in NSW [18]. in NSW for 2015\u20132016 there were 21152 beds available from public hospitals (2.78 per 1000 population) and 8184 beds available from private hospitals (1.07 per 1000 population) the number of available hospital beds in Sydney will be enough to isolate up to 95% of all new infected cases every day, under different scenarios. the only uniform qualification in public health is a master of public health. the number working in government public health roles would be a minority. a MPH does not equip people with the skills for field response to an epidemic. the number of contacts needed to be traced and managed was estimated based on attack size, time to response (T) and the percentage of infected cases isolated each day. a sensitivity analysis was conducted on attack size, the proportion of infectious cases isolated and contacts traced, as well as time to commence the response. different infectivity levels were based on the reproduction number for hemorrhagic, flat, ordinary and modified smallpox. the force of infection was multiplied by a parameter (1, 2, 3, 4) to account for different population susceptibility levels. to test the preparedness of the health system we assumed the base case response would be case isolation and treatment. the number of hospital beds needed for case isolation was then modelled under different scenarios based on variation of response time (T), the percentage of infected cases isolated each day and how many contacts were traced. we tested if the number of available hospital beds in Sydney will be enough to isolate up to 95% of all new infected cases every day. there are approximately 300 alumni of the national Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) there is a medical specialisation in public health medicine for a relatively small number of medical doctors, with an estimated 244 full time equivalent public health physicians nationwide in 2017 [17]. the public health workforce was calculated using estimates of MPH graduates currently working in government, FETP graduates or current FETP trainees and public health physicians. we modelled the difference in epidemic size between a single index case of smallpox imported from overseas. the size of an attack is unknown, and would depend on the technical sophistication of aerosol dispersion of variola. delays in diagnosis and time to obtaining laboratory confirmation could vary the time of onset of the response. the total estimated health workforce number was 147997 for NSW. based on epidemic size and duration, we estimated the amount of respiratory PPE (N95 respirators) required for Sydney clinical HCWs assuming two respirators per shift per HCW. this is based on recommendations that disposable respirators should not be re-used, and the fact that a standard shift for a HCW would include at least one break. we assumed 90% of contacts would be traced and 95% infectious people would be isolated. we assumed one public health officer could trace 10 contacts per day. isolation is needed for non-immune Category A (high risk) contacts. delays in diagnosis and time to obtaining laboratory confirmation could vary the time of onset of the response. we therefore varied the time of the response commencing between T = 15, 20 and T = 30 days following virus release. analysis on proportion of infected cases isolated and time from virus release to starting interventions. results shown for 100 initial infected and 90% contacts traced/vaccinated. Fig 3 shows the influence of varying time of starting the intervention. the modelled maximum number of people isolated at the same time is about 2.3 and 5.5 times the initial number of infected if we start intervention respectively at T = 20 and at T = 30. in the case of 100 initial infected, the maximum beds usage will reach 1.6% and 3.8% of Sydney public available beds 28 days after the response commences. if we start the intervention at T = 20 from virus release, 1703 beds will be used the first day, 3356 the second day. at 7 and 13 days after starting the intervention, more than 50% and 80% of the total beds in Sydney hospitals will be needed. at day 39 post-attack, 19 days after starting the intervention, 100% of all available public and private beds will be used. NR NR NR NR NR NR NR NR 1487 (7%) 2264 (11%) 5291 (26%) 100 Initial infected NR NR NR NR NR NR NR NR 149 (less than 1%) 227 (1%) 531 (3%) NR = never reaches 20% of available beds Clinical HCW and PPE requirements The number of HCWs required and the PPE they need will increase 100% unless reduced staff/patient ratios are implemented. the modelled maximum number of people isolated at the same time is about 2.3 and 5.5 times the initial number of infected if we start intervention respectively at T = 20 and at T = 30. if the initial number of infected is 100 or 1000, the available beds will not be completely exhausted, but treatment capacity for other illnesses may be affected. available beds will be used in the first 2 days, 80% at day 5 of response will be used and at day 6 of the response (T = 36 after the attack) all available public and private beds will be used at levels of 20% or greater. in worst-case scenario, 100% of beds will be used by day 36. a minimum of 2 disposable respirators a day per HCWs for 150 days will need to be stockpiled for all 100638 clinical HCWs in Sydney. this number can be used to estimate requirements based on the estimated percentage of the clinical workforce needed for the epidemic. if 10% of clinical HCWs are involved in care of smallpox patients, over 3 million respirators will be needed. the size of an attack may not be within our control, but other factors are modifiable and potentially within our control. if the initial attack size is 100\u20131000 and the response is rapid, an outbreak of smallpox can be controlled with case isolation, contact tracing and vaccination. if the response is delayed to 30 days or longer, or the attack infects 10000 people, epidemic control will be much more challenging. rapid response time is critical and becomes even more critical when the initial infected number is higher. a rapid response depends on very early detection and diagnosis, as well as prompt commencement of case finding, isolation, contact tracing and vaccination. delays may occur if the diagnosis is missed in the index case. tracing only half of all contacts will result in a blow-out of the epidemic. space and human resource requirements for case finding, isolation, contact tracing, vaccination and quarantine are therefore essential for preparedness planning. in worst-case scenario, almost one million contacts need to be traced. a possible approach to such a scenario would be a reduction of staff to patient ratios, as well as using trainee HCWs. up to 100,000 doses of vaccine will need to be reserved for clinical HCWs and plans in place to commence vaccination. the modelled epidemic may run for 150\u2013300 days or more. australia has a detailed plan for smallpox response,[39] and we have outlined key influential parameters for disease control. planning for the health system should consider rapid surge capacity for beds, strategies to create and staff make-shift designated smallpox treatment facilities."}
