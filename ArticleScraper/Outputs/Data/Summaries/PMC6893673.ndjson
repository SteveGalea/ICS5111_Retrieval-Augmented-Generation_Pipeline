{"summary": "Astroviruses are non-enveloped, 28\u201330 nm positive-sense, single stranded RNA viruses [2] that can cause disease and be detected in the feces from a wide variety of mammals and birds [3,4,5,6,7,8,9] the pathogenicity of a majority of PoAstVs is not well characterized with the exception of PoAstV3. three cross-sectional studies were carried out on sow farms in the united states without (n = 2; Sow Farm 1 and 2) and with (n = 1; Sow Farm 3) PoAstV3-associated neurologic disease in the downstream nursery. on Sow Farm 1, fecal samples were collected from ten families (sow and 5 piglets per sow) spatially distributed. Sow Farm 2 was diagnosed with neurologic signs due to Streptococcus suis. the farm produces roughly 26.9 pigs per sow per year. no reported swine movement among these three breeding farms. of RNA was performed using the MagMAXTM Pathogen RNA/DNA Kit isolation kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) an xeno internal positive control RNA template38 was added to the lysis solution at 50,000 copies/extraction. at least one negative extraction control (NEC) and one negative amplification control (NAC) was included in each PCR assay. the results were analyzed using an automatic baseline setting with a threshold at 0.1. the equation for PoAstV3 genomic copy number per ml of sample was 10((Cq45.82)/3.287) the standard curve is available in Supplementary Figure S1. 2.5. slides were heated for 1 h at 60 \u00b0C followed by a de-paraffinization treatment. slides were then immersed in target retrieval solution for 30 min at 100 \u00b0C. probes were then hybridized for 2 h at 40 \u00b0C. a litter was considered positive when PoAstV3 was detected by RT-qPCR in 50% of piglets tested. a litter was considered positive when PoAstV3 was detected by RT-qPCR in feces and histologic lesions. a litter was considered positive when PoAstV3 was detected. three cross-sectional studies were carried out on sow farms in the united states without (n = 2; Sow Farm 1 and 2) and with (n = 1; Sow Farm 3) PoAstV3-associated neurologic disease in the downstream nursery. fecal samples were collected from ten families (sow and 5 piglets per sow) spatially distributed. sow farm 3 is a 3000 sow breed-to-wean farm located in southeast Iowa. the farm produces roughly 26.9 pigs per sow per year. no reported swine movement among these three breeding farms. xeno internal positive control (XIPC) RNA template38 was added to the lysis solution at 50,000 copies/extraction. at least one negative extraction control (NEC) and one negative amplification control (NAC) was included in each PCR assay. the equation for PoAstV3 genomic copy number per ml of sample was 10((Cq45.82)/3.287) the standard curve is available in Supplementary Figure S1. 2.5. a veterinary diagnostic pathologist blinded to clinical presentation and all test results. slides were heated for 1 h at 60 \u00b0C followed by a de-paraffinization treatment. slides were then immersed in target retrieval solution for 30 min at 100 \u00b0C. probes were then hybridized for 2 h at 40 \u00b0C. a litter was considered positive when PoAstV3 was detected by RT-qPCR in 50% of piglets tested. a litter was considered positive when PoAstV3 was detected by RT-qPCR in 50% of piglets tested. the frequency of detection of PoAstV3 was 77% (54 of 70) by RT-qPCR with varying levels of detection across different age groups. the distribution of the number of samples in a given Cq range as well as the corresponding gc/mL of sample range is provided in Supplemental Table S1. the overall detection of PoAstV3 was found to be 85% (207 of 244) by RT-qPCR. the mean PoAstV3 RT-qPCR Cq value of piglets was significantly lower than the mean Cq value of sows (p 0.0001) PoAstV3 was detected by RT-qPCR in fecal samples from 9 of 13 piglets (69%; mean Cq = 26.02; Cq range = 17.96\u201335.71). fluid filled small and large intestine was noted in 25% and 67% of piglets in the control and enteric disease group, respectively. atrophic enteritis (p = 0.4142) or colitis (p = 0.1025).

PoAstV3 was detected via ISH in all PoAstV3-positive animals assayed (n = 4). labeling was present in rare to occasional gastric pit cells in three of the four pigs assayed. labeling was present in rare to occasional enterocytes of the jejunum in three of the four pigs and the lamina propria of the jejunum in a single pig. sow farm 2 PoAstV3 was detected in 74% (46 of 62; mean Cq = 29.76; Cq range= 14.69\u201338.66) of fecal samples by RT-qPCR (Table 1). the frequency of detection was 97% (30 of 31; mean Cq = 26.50; Cq range= 14.69\u201338.66) in piglets and 52% (16 of 31; mean Cq = 35.89; Cq range= 30.99\u201338 the distribution of the number of samples in a given Cq range as well as the corresponding gc/mL of sample range is provided in Supplemental Table S1. the frequency of PoAstV3 in sows or piglets was significantly greater than in gilts (p 0.0001). the overall detection of PoAstV3 was found to be 85% (207 of 244) by RT-qPCR with varying levels of detection across different age groups. there was no statistical difference found in the overall detection of PoAstV3 on Sow Farm 1 between Phase-I and Phase-II.
