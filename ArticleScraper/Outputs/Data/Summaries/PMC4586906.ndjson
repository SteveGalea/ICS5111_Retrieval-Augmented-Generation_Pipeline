{"summary": "the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in west africa represents the largest outbreak of the virus to date. the numbers of infected cases from Ebola show a trend of bouncing back after declining in February 2015. it is important to determine the best model by using mathematical models and model selection methods. a single peak of high incidence, an S-shaped cumulative epidemic curve and a single turning point of an outbreak can be the best fitting to data using the selected model. in this study we calculate the Bayes factor with the ratio of the selected number of different models and sample from the joint space of product of model and parameters in each model and then estimate the posterior probability of each model using Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithms. based on the real data sets for 2009 A/H1N1 in mainland China. we focus on estimating basic reproduction number, turning point, and final size of A/H1N1 and Ebola. we then explain some important issues related to the emerging infection disease control. the turning point plays an important role in determining the rate of change transitions from positive to negative, that is, the moment at which the cases begin to decline. the final size of an emerging infectious disease is another important quantity for public health, which is the likely magnitude of the outbreak. the distribution q is called the instrumental (or proposal or candidate) distribution and probability (x (t), y) is the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability [16]. Suppose that the observed data Y is generated by a model g j M, where M is the finite set of competing models. approach to estimating posterior model probabilities using MCMC has been included in the model indicator M as a parameter in the sampling order. as a result, most model settings require that the MCMC searches over the models and parameter space jointly. this joint search also permits posterior estimation of the parameters under each model, P( jM = g j, Y) four models are widely used single species models which can be solved analytically and thus can be easily employed to fit the data and estimate the unknown parameters. we assume that the reported cases follow a Poisson process. if the real cumulative number of cases at a given time t is n t, the probability of the number of cases reported is n t. a new model g j\u2032 with probability q(g j), j, j\u2032j. accept the proposed move with probability g j, g j \u2032 = min 1, f Y j \u2032, M = g j \u2032 P j \u2032 M = g j \u2032 q g j \u2032, g j f Y j, M = g j \u2032.

Suppose that the observed data Y is generated by a model g j M, where M is the finite set of competing models. this joint search permits posterior estimation of the parameters under each model, P( jM = g j, Y), the prior probability is P( jM = g j), the prior probability is P( jM = g j), and Y is independent of j\u2032j given the model indicator M [17]. if the real cumulative number of cases at a given time t is n t, the probability of the number of cases reported is P Y t = y t N t = n t = n t y t y t! e n t. q j = 1 for models g 1 and g 2. probability g j, g j \u2032 = min 1, f Y j \u2032, M = g j \u2032 P j \u2032 M = g j j \u2032 q g j \u2032, g j f Y j, M = g j \u2032 M = g j j \u2032 q g j \u2032, g j f Y j, M = g j \u2032 1 No evidence 1 B j\u2032j 3 Anecdotal evidence for model j\u2032 3 B j\u2032j 30 Strong evidence for model j\u2032 30 B j\u2032j 100 Very strong evidence for model j\u2032b j\u2032j > 100 Decisive evidence for model j\u2032. first, we obtain the Markov chains having 500000 samplers for each parameter of each model, respectively, carrying out the MCMC procedure by using an adaptive MH algorithm. \u2032 t 1 M = g j \u2032 j \u2032 q g j \u2032, g j f Y j t 1, M = g j P j t 1 M = g j j q g j, g j \u2032 (14) with q(g j, g j\u2032) = q(g j\u2032, g j. two models from t = 1 to t = 40, we get forty time points of each model, denoted by Y = (y 1,..., y 40) and Z = (z 1,..., z 40) respectively. we realize the model selection based on the algorithm introduced in the previous section, as shown in the first line of Table 2. data source Parameter Mean Std.
