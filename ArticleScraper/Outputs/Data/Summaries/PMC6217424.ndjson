{"summary": "NSC34 cells were infected with nsP3MD mutants G32S and Y114A. virus production was compared with WT CHIKV-infected cells. nsP3MD mutations that alter ADPr binding or hydrolase activity affect replication in neuronal cells. NSC34 cells were infected with CHIKV 181/25 and nsP3MD mutants G32S and Y114A at an MOI of 5, and cell lysates were immunoblotted for ADPr. antibody against -actin was used for loading controls. CHIKV Infection of NSC34 Cells Increases ADP Ribosylation of cellular proteins without Inducing IFN or PARP Gene Transcription. infected cells were assessed from 2 to 36 h after infection for expression of PARP 1, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14 mRNAs by qRT-PCR. nsP3MD Mutations Affecting ADPr-Binding and Hydrolase activities Differentially Affect Initiation of Infection. the role of nsP3MD ADPr-binding and hydrolase activity for replication is not clear. mutant virus was less impaired than the G32S mutant (30 vs. 150 infectious centers per 105 cells at MOI 0.5, P 0.05; 240 vs. 1,515 infectious centers per 105 cells at MOI 5, P 0.01) but established fewer infectious centers than WT CHIKV (150 vs. 691 infectious centers per 105 cells at MOI 0.5, P 0.01) the data are presented as log10 infectious centers per 105 cells. each value represents the average SD from three independent experiments. the first steps in replication are translation of the nsPs and establishment of spherules. individual cells infected with WT virus amplified replication complexes with dsRNA better than cells infected with Y114A virus. the data are presented as the means SD from three independent experiments. the data are presented as the means SD from three independent experiments. sized by the G32S mutant virus were significantly less than the amounts synthesized by either the WT or Y114A viruses. levels of genomic (A) and genomic plus sg (B) RNA from NSC34 cells infected with CHIKV 181/25 (WT) and nsP3MD mutants were measured by qRT-PCR. CHIKV 181/25 or nsP3MD mutants G32S or Y114A produced less E2 than WT. y114A produced less E2 than Y114A, indicating hydrolase activity is required at later stages of virus production. alphavirus replication induces host translational shutoff that also affects polyprotein translation from full-length genomic RNA. we assessed the effects of WT and mutant virus infection on the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2 by immunoblot. eIF2 was evident by 8\u201312 h for all viruses, increased at 24 h for WT and Y114A. nsP3MD mutants G32S or Y114A were probed by immunoblot for levels of total and phosphorylated eIF2. data are expressed as the mean fold change over mock-infected cells SD. one plasmid encodes the CHIKV P1234 polyprotein behind a human cytomegalovirus-driven polymerase II (pol II) promoter. a second plasmid encodes a viral template RNA for synthesis of luciferase reporters from both the genomic 5\u2032 UTR (firefly luciferase, Fluc) and subgenomic 5\u2032 UTR (Gaussia luciferase, Gluc) inactivated nsP4 polymerase hCMV-P1234GAA plasmid and a pol I 5\u2032 UTR\u2013Fluc\u2013sg promoter\u2013Gluc\u20133\u2032 UTR plasmid were transfected with 1 g of each plasmid. the plasmid was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. expression of the WT replicase suggests transcriptional shutoff is impaired by mutations in nsP3. lower levels of WT nsPs were detected on immunoblot. peak genomic RNA synthesis for the virus was 18 h after transfection. sgRNA synthesis increased gradually and was maximal at 24 h and 48 h (P 0.0001) after transfection. viruses with nsP3MD mutations D10A, G32E, and G112E are deficient in ADPr binding. nsP3MD mutants G32S and Y114A replicate with similar kinetics but lower virus production at all times than the WT virus. virus production was compared with WT CHIKV-infected cells. each value represents the average SD from three independent experiments. ***P 0.001, ****P 0.0001 (181/25 vs. nsP3MD mutants G32S and Y114A) intracellular RNAs were assayed by qRT-PCR for viral genomic (nsP2; Middle) and genomic+sg E2 RNA and were compared with standard curves of CHIKV RNAs (Right). each value represents the average SD from three independent experiments. mRNAs examined were increased, and type I IFN was not detectable at any time after infection. increased ADP ribosylation of NSC34 cellular proteins induced by CHIKV infection is likely due to increased PARP activity without evidence of IFN induction. nsP3MD Mutations Affecting ADPr-Binding and hydrolase activities Differentially Affect Initiation of infection. the Y114A mutant virus was less impaired than the G32S mutant. in vitro-transcribed RNA was transfected directly into BHK21 cells. nsP3MD mutations affecting ADP ribosyl binding and hydrolase activities differentially affect the initiation of infection. infected cells were trypsinized, viable cells were counted, and serially diluted cells were plated on Vero cells to identify virus-producing cells. the data are presented as log10 infectious centers per 105 cells. each value represents the average SD from three independent experiments. fected with WT virus or Y114A at 12, 24, and 36 h after infection. the numbers of cells staining positively for dsRNA were similar in WT and Y114A-infected cells at 12 h. the numbers of cells staining positively for dsRNA were only slightly less at 24 and 36 h. levels of genomic RNA and sgRNA synthesized by Y114A were significantly less than those synthesized by either the WT or Y114A viruses. levels of RNA synthesized by Y114A were not detectably different from those synthesized by the WT virus. lysates were also probed for the E2 glycoprotein. lysates were also probed for the nsP3MD mutation. lysates were also probed for the E2 glycoprotein. virus with the Y114A mutation decreased hydrolase activity but increased binding was only slightly impaired for infection initiation. virus with the Y114A mutation decreased hydrolase activity but increased binding was only slightly impaired for infection initiation. eIF2 was evident by 8\u201312 h for all viruses and was increased at 24 h for all viruses. NSC34 cells were infected with CHIKV 181/25 (WT) or nsP3MD mutants G32S or Y114A at an MOI of 5. (A and B) Cell lysates were probed by immunoblot for levels of total and phosphorylated eIF2. a modified CHIKV transreplication system was used to generate host-mediated synthesis of nsPs and template RNAs. one plasmid encodes the CHIKV P1234 polyprotein behind a human cytomegalovirus-driven polymerase II promoter. a second plasmid encodes a viral template RNA for synthesis of luciferase reporters from both the genomic 5\u2032 UTR and subgenomic 5\u2032 UTR transreplicase system includes an hCMV-P1234 plasmid with and without nsP3MD mutations, an identical inactivated nsP4 polymerase hCMV-P1234GAA plasmid and a pol I 5\u2032 UTR\u2013Fluc\u2013sg promoter\u2013Gluc\u20133\u2032 UTR plasmid. nsP4 cells were transfected with 1 g of each plasmid and were in less protein was present at 24 h with expression of the WT replicase. this suggests transcriptional shutoff is impaired by mutations in nsP3. peak genomic RNA synthesis for the virus was 18 h after transfection. virus with nsP3MD mutations D10A, G32E, and G112E are deficient in ADPr binding. nsP3MDs have mono ADPr hydrolase as well as binding activity. mutations that affect these functions of alphavirus nsP3MDs attenuate virus replication. initiation of infection is inefficient, and little virus is produced. nsP3MD binding to one or more ADP-ribosylated host cell or viral proteins is critical for initiating infection. amplification of replication complexes is less efficient, and virus production is delayed. mutations in the MD of nsP3 also impair inhibition of pol II transcription. reporter expression from a replication-competent template is dependent on the ability of the nsPs to form a functional replicase to amplify genomic RNA and synthesize sgRNA. nsP3MD mutations D10A, G32E, and Y114A were not viable because viral RNA could not be synthesized. levels of reporter protein expression for the viable mutants allowed separate assessment of the relative importance of ADPr binding. G3BP1 and 2 are RNA-binding proteins that interact with the FGDF motif in the nsP3 HVD through a NTF2-like motif in G3BP (89, 90), that are essential for early steps in replication of Old World alphaviruses. reduced nsP3 HVD interaction with G3BP impairs CHIKV replication (90). a deficiency in MD hydrolase function as well as a binding defect resulted in the impairment of replication and replicase activity. Y114A was not able to amplify replication complexes as well as the WT virus, potentially because more rapid synthesis of nsPs and dsRNA led to earlier shutdown of cap-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs and genomic viral RNA. baby hamster kidney 21 (BHK21) was grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, l-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 g/mL) to assess the effect of inhibition of MARylation on virus replication. cells were treated at the time of infection with the pan mono PARP inhibitor ITK6 (5 M) (67) in DMEM plus 1% FBS qRT PCR for PARP Gene Expression. cells were mock infected or were infected with 5 pfu WT CHIKV. cDNA was synthesized with random primers. NSC34 cells were infected with WT and nsP3MD G32S and Y114A mutant viruses at MOIs of 0.5 and 5 for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. cells were shifted to 37 \u00b0C for 4 h or were transfected with 10 g RNA transcribed from a full-length cDNA clone using Amaxa-Nucleofector II. goat anti-mouse IgG was analyzed on a flow cytometer. histograms were plotted to determine median fluorescence intensity and the percent of live cells positive for dsRNA. RNA was quantified with a nanodrop spectrophotometer. cDNA was synthesized using the High Capacity cDNA Synthesis Kit. RNA were quantified using a standard curve constructed of 10-fold dilutions of a pCRII-TOPO plasmid containing the CHIKV E2 or nsP2 region cDNA and normalized to endogenous rodent Gapdh. data are plotted as mean CHIKV RNA copies per 106 copies of Gapdh. clones prepared were D10A, G32S or G32E, G112E, and Y114A. one microgram each of CMV-P1234 or CMV P1234GAA and pol I-Fluc-Gluc were cotransfected into NSC34 cells using lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) cells were lysed with Renilla luciferase assay lysis buffer (Promega) after 12, 18, 24, and cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,700 g for 10 min. total protein was estimated using the DC assay (Bio-Rad) 10 g was loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed. membranes were probed after electrophoresis and transfer. d with mouse anti-puromycin monoclonal antibody clone 12D10 (Millipore) (68) and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000) were developed using the amersham ECL Plus Western Blot Developing Kit. differences between groups during infection were determined using two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post tests. yltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed 91% viability at 2 M, 87% viability at 5 M, and 73% viability at 10 M. mutant viruses were rescued as previously described. cDNA was synthesized with random primers. all reactions were run on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-time PCR machine. IFN and levels in supernatant fluids from mock-infected and CHIKV-infected cells were measured at intervals from 2 to 36 h. cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in PBS and stained with 0.02% crystal violet. plaques were counted as number of infectious centers per 105 cells. dsRNA Flow Cytometry. cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. a CHIKV transreplicase system was used to measure the replicase activity of nsP3MD mutants without requiring virus infection. two plasmids were transfected: one encoding P1234 controlled by the immediate early early promoter of hCMV and the second encoding a hCMV. hCMV-driven P1234 and P1234GAA plasmids with point mutations in the nsP3MD were generated using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) one microgram each of CMV-P1234 or CMV P1234GAA and pol I-Fluc-Gluc were cotransfected into NSC34 cells using lipofectamine LTX. luciferase activity per microgram of protein for P1234GAA was subtracted from luciferase activity for P1234. cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,700 g for 10 min. total protein was estimated using the DC assay. membranes were probed with mouse anti-puromycin monoclonal antibody clone 12D10 (Millipore) (68) and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000) and incubated for 1 h at RT."}
