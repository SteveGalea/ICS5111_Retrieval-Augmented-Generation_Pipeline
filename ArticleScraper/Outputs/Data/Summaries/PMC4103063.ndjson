{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a paramyxovirus in the genus Metapneumovirus. it is responsible for 5\u201315 % of hospitalizations of children suffering from acute respiratory tract infections. innate immune system protects cells against viral infections through production of type I IFNs. the presence of DIs in virus stocks was reported in the 1960s. 'copyback' or'snapback' types are strong IFN inducers, which correlate with their ability to self-anneal and form dsRNA. HMPV accumulates DIs with a snapback structure rapidly upon in vitro passage, causing activation of the IFN pathway upon infection. RNA-editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) was the most likely enzyme responsible for editing of HMPV DIs. the supernatants were tested for IFN content and compared with mock-inoculated cell supernatants. the supernatants showed low amounts of IFN to the supernatants of cells inoculated with PIV-5. the lack of IFN induction by P2low was not due to a lower infection efficiency. IFN production was measured using an ISRE-firefly luciferase bioassay. values indicate fold induction compared with mock-infected cells. all 47 reads aligned to the region upstream of position 11 200 of the viral genome, the same region where P5high displayed deeper coverage than P2low. the complementarity of the two strands indicated that P5high contained DIs with a \u2018snapback\u2019 structure. sequences obtained for 12 proposed DIs were mapped against the HMPV genome. green bars indicate the genomic strand, the red bars indicate the antigenomic strand and black lines indicate that the two bars were connected at that point. all DI reads were too short to reach from the cross-over point to the trailer sequences. the blot was exposed to a phosphorimager screen and analysed with a storm 850 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant 1.2 software. RT-PCR assays directly on the virus stocks confirmed the presence of DIs. individual reads varied in the position and number of mutations. a range of 5\u201377 % of the A residues mutated to G and 5.7\u201357.1 % of the T residues mutated to C. the highest probability for AG or TC editing was detected where the 5\u2032-neighbour nucleotide was a U. blue bars indicate the TC edit probability for the 3\u2032 neighbour after complementing the neighbour with its base pair. RT-PCR assays performed with primer sets designed based on the human ADAR1 sequences. the human ADAR1-p150 and vero-ADAR-p110 mRNA displayed 95 % nucleotide sequence identity with the human ADAR1-p150 and ADAR1-p110 mRNAs. 49 cells were inoculated with these stocks as well as with sendai virus (VSV), measles virus Edmonston strain (MeV-Edm) and parainfluenza type 5 (PIV-5) as controls. the supernatants were tested for IFN content and compared with mock-inoculated cell supernatants. UV treatment of P5high, P2low and SeV virus stocks resulted in reduced infection of A549 cells with P5high and SeV. this suggested that the IFN induction by P5high may be attributed to the presence of DIs. from nucleotide 11 726 onwards, P5high displayed up to 31 times more depth of sequence than P2low. for P5high 16.3 % of the 8200 reads mapped to the region beyond position 11 kb of the genome, compared with only 2.2 % of 28 121 reads obtained for P2low. all 47 reads aligned to the region upstream of position 11 200 of the viral genome, the same region where P5high displayed deeper coverage than no specific sequence motif was detected at the position of cross-over points that may have served as a signal for the polymerase to switch strands. x-axis corresponds to the nt 13 365 position in the HMPV genome. smaller RNAs ranging in size from 0.5 to 4 kb were detected but only in P5high. 80 % of total RNA, in the size range 0.5\u20134 kb for P5high, was probably of DI origin. the blot was exposed to a phosphorimager screen and analysed with a storm 850 software. in the region downstream of nt 11 000, 53.6 % of the A residues in the reference sequence displayed mutation to G and 35.7 % of the T residues displayed mutation to C. in the region beyond position 12 000, 75 % of the reads displayed hypermutation and the mutation percentages in this region were even higher. mutation was calculated when at least 5 % of reads displayed a mutation for that nucleotide. highest probability for AG or TC editing was detected where the 5\u2032-neighbour nucleotide was a U. two isoforms of the ADAR1 protein are generated through alternative promoters. long form (ADAR1-p150) is IFN inducible and localizes mostly in the cytoplasm. short form (ADAR1-p110) is expressed constitutively and localizes, like ADAR2, predominantly in the nucleus. we did not observe induction of IFN production for HMPV NL/1/00 and NL/1/99 upon passage at low m.o.i. only after a few passages at high m.o.i. was HMPV-induced IFN production observed. this was caused primarily by the presence of DIs with a \u2018snapback\u2019 structure in the virus stocks. deep sequencing may be less efficient in obtaining reads mapping to the 5\u2032 end of the genome. however, many more reads in the deep-sequencing analysis may have been of DI origin but not identified as such as such as they lacked the cross-over point. the IFN-inducible ADAR1-p150 resides in the cytoplasm, while the constitutively expressed ADAR1-p110 and ADAR2 reside in the nucleus. we did not observe a clear upregulation of ADAR1-p150 mRNA in IFN-treated Vero-118 cells. ADAR-induced hypermutation of MeV has been studied in detail. but it is unclear why this hypermutation was not observed upon inoculation of vero cells with MeV. studies in ADAR-deficient cells and RNA-binding studies should elucidate the actual role of ADAR in editing HMPV (DI) RNA. stocks used in persistently infected animals contained DIs. extensive AI editing has been described in RNAs from MeV isolated from patients with persistent central nervous system infection. research needs to elucidate how ADAR subverts the innate immune system. 1,100 g streptomycin ml1 and 2 mM glutamine (PSG) supernatants were used to inoculate vero-118 cells. one stock was generated with a maximum of two passages in vero-118 cells at a low m.o.i. of 0.01. a second stock was generated by five passages in vero-118 cells at a high m.o.i. of 3. cDNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed as described previously. amplification of DI genomes was performed with primers BF568, 5\u2032-CTCTGCATTCCCTAGATTATC-3\u2032 and BF593, 5\u2032-CCGCCGCCACAGAGAAGAATGGC-3\u2032. real-time PCR assays were performed with a 7000 Sequence Detection System.
