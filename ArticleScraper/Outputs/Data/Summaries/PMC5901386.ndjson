NT titers were calculated from dilutions that correspond to a 50% plaque reduction compared with the control. serum samples were subjected to serial 2-fold dilutions with PBS in 96-well plates. equal volumes (50 l) of an influenza virus solution (4 hemagglutination units) were then added to the diluted serum samples and mixed. sRS (4), pGE-RID4 and pGE-LysN4 tested. LysRS of eukaryotic origin carries an extra N-terminal domain (RID) that is absent in the E. coli counterpart. fusion protein HAgD-mRID was eluted at 70% in a dimeric state. all fusion tags in this study were placed in the N-terminal part of target proteins. expression at lower temperature increased the solubility of proteins. the RIDs of all 3 species are produced predominantly in the soluble form (>95% for hRID and mRID and 80% for rRID respectively) the RID equivalent is absent in E. coli LysRS and therefore, could not be tested. HAgD and rRID-HAgD were chosen as immunogens for inoculation of mice or rabbits. eGFP was used as a reporter for solubility as a fusion to RID. eGFP was used as a reporter for solubility as a fusion to RID. the soluble fraction containing the bulk of recombinant proteins was loaded onto the Ni column. proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole, ranging from 10 to 300 mM. the major protein band corresponds to the expected molecular mass of 40 kDa. rRID-HAgD showed an elution volume of 17.60 ml and the estimated size of 143.87 kDa. the estimated size of trimeric RID-HAgD (140\u2013144 kDa) is slightly bigger than the calculated value (40 kDa 3 = 120 kDa) eLysRS-HAgD protein was a mixture of oligomers and the dimer in solution. the elution pattern showed the efficacy of the RID in promoting the folding and assembly of its reporter HA protein into the native trimeric conformation. mRID-HAgD and rRID-HAgD were eluted in trimeric form on the basis of Kav. recombinant HAgD proteins were evaluated regarding their capacity for binding to terminal sialic acid residues by an ELISA. fetuin is a glycoprotein that contains sialic acid and can be used in a convenient assay for evaluation of binding of a functional trimeric assembly of an HA protein. total extract (T) was centrifuged to obtain supernatant of soluble fraction (SS) and precipitate of soluble (SP) fractions. elimination of RNA by RNase A digestion reduced solubility of mRID-HAgD. hRIDmu6-HAgD and hRIDmu9-HAgD were eluted as a mixture of trimeric and oligomeric forms on the basis of Kav. hRIDmu6-HAgD and hRIDmu9-HAgD were eluted as a mixture of dimeric and oligomeric forms. antiserum was applied to antibody production in mice and rabbits. ELISA data confirmed immunization elicited robust antibody responses against target reporter antigen HAgD or eGFP but much less toward the RID docking tag. high immunogenicity of eLysRS may be due to low sequence homology of LysRS between the mouse and E. coli (36%) high immunogenicity of eLysRS may be because of low sequence homology of LysRS between the mouse and E. coli. differences in antibody levels between groups eLysRS and eLysRS-HAgD relative to the serum samples from mice (n = 3) immunized with an RID-fused immunogen; (lower) WB analysis for the detection of antibodies in the mouse serum samples. x-axis indicates reciprocal serum dilution (log2) serum samples from mRID-eGFP-immunized mice showed an immunoreaction with the HAgD protein. the predominant response was directed against the eGFP or HAgD reporter proteins, rather than rRID. the lack of crossreactivity between mouse antiserum and rRID of rabbit origin was probably a result of high homology of RIDs between the 2 host species. e were infected intranasally with a sublethal dose (102 PFUs) of the PR8 (H1N1) virus to obtain antiserum against the PR8 (H1N1) virus. four weeks later, blood was drawn from each mouse via transorbital collection, and serum was prepared. all of the mice survived with a maximum weight loss of 23% by 7 d postchallenge (dpc) and recovered slowly. reassortant strains carrying 6 internal genes from cold-adapted X-31 virus. lower reactivity was observed with heterologous virus New Caledonia (NC; H1N1) or heterosubtypes, including Panama (PA; H3N2), Indonesia (ID; H5N1), or Korea (KR; H5N1). recombinant proteins, RID-HAgD, were detected by highly diluted antibodies against the PR8 (H1N1) virus in serum samples from infected mice (n = 5) the refolded HAgD without RID as a coating protein was detected only at much lower dilution (50-fold or 26-fold lower) of the antisera. the initial serum dilution was 1/50. the HI assay was carried out by means of antisera collected from the immunized mice. multiple immunizations with the HAgD without RID did not generate HI or NT antibodies to the PR8 (H1N1) virus. antisera from rabbits (n = 2) immunized with 1 mg of the rRID-HAgD recombinant vaccine showed higher HI titers (>64) and higher NT antibody levels (>40) than those shown by mouse antisera. an HI assay was performed on serum samples from mice (n = 5) immunized with mRID-HAgD (20 g/mouse), PBS, or the HAgD without RID (15 g/mouse) the HI antibody titers increased 32-fold, depending on the number of immunization boosts with mRID-HAgD (20 g/mouse) mice immunized intraperitoneally with 4 g RID-HAgD antigens (mRID-HAgD: n = 3; rRID-HAgD: n = 3) lost 13% of body weight by 8 dpc. immunization with eLysRS-HAgD even at a high dose (75 g) failed to provide protection. mice immunized with 4 g RID-HAgD (n = 6) or RID-eGFP control (n = 6) were challenged with 1 times LD50 of the PR8 (H1N1) virus (103 PFUs), and the body weight changes (A) and survival rates (B) of the infected mice were monitored daily. challenged with 1 times LD50 of the PR8 (H1N1) virus (103 PFUs) immunity with eLysRS-HAgD or PBS failed to provide protection. only one mouse succumbed within 7 dpc. fusion linker contains ENLYFQ sequence for site-specific cleavage by TEV protease, if needed. schematic diagrams of HA trimers in the mature virion and of the recombinant RID-HAgD fusion protein are shown in Fig. 1E. expression at lower temperature increased the solubility of the proteins. expression at lower temperature increased the solubility of the proteins. eLysRS had superb solubility compared with mouse or rabbit origins. expression of fusion partners of mouse origin was higher than expression of fusion partners of rabbit origin. but their solubility levels were similar. each RID fusion showed a strongly increased total soluble yield of the respective proteins. proteins were expressed solubly at 37\u00b0C. expression profiles of recombinant proteins RID-HAgD and eLysRS-HAgD. expression profiles of recombinant proteins RID-HAgD. the final concentrations of purified RID-eGFPs were 9 and 3.7 mg/ml. the final concentrations of proteins without fusion to mRID after chemical refolding were 1.4 and 7.3 mg/ml for the HAgD and eGFP. fusion junction and the elongated nature of the RID are expected to cause slight overestimation of the overall size of a fusion protein (17, 18) mRID-eGFP was eluted at elution volumes 12.80 and 22.50 ml, indicating a mixture of oligomeric (30%) and monomeric (70%) conformations. eLysRS-HAgD protein was eluted as a mixture of oligomeric mRID-eGFP was eluted as a mixture of oligomeric (30%) and monomeric (70%; estimated at 34.2 kDa) forms. refolded HAgD without RID was eluted predominantly in monomeric form (80%; estimated at 25.6 kDa) mRID-HAgD trimer manifested stronger binding than monomeric HAgD. eLysRS-HAgD failed to bind, as was case for mRID-eGFP. effect of RNA on solubility of antigens Depletion of RNA by RNase A was performed. the total extract (T) was centrifuged to obtain soluble (S) and pellet (P) fractions. the total extract (T) was centrifuged to obtain supernatant of soluble (SS) and precipitate of soluble (SP) fractions. elimination of RNA by RNase A digestion reduced solubility of RID-HAgD. mutants hRIDmu2, hRIDmu6, and hRIDmu9 were introduced into each site to generate mutations at 2, 6, and all 9 sites involved in RNA binding. all of these proteins were expressed in soluble form, purified by Ni-affinity chromatography, and subjected to SEC for the analysis of trimeric assembly. elISA signal was much stronger for the reporter antigen regardless of the source of the docking protein. the same conclusions were drawn regardless of the animal species to be immunized. elysRS-HAgD as an immunogen showed a similar magnitude of the responses to fusion proteins eLysRS and eLysRS-HAgD. the antibody against RID-HAgD bound specifically to the HAgD (cleaved) and RID-HAgD (remained uncleaved) but not to the RID docking tag alone (cleaved; Fig. 5A\u2013F and Supplemental Fig. 2A\u2013D) rRID was detected by rabbit antiserum raised against rRID fusion proteins but failed to be detected after TEV treatment. the positive detection was a result of the immune response to the His tag + MCS moiety, rather than the self-rRID docking tag. the lack of crossreactivity between mouse antiserum and rRID of rabbit origin was probably a result of high homology of RIDs between the 2 host species. the weak but distinct ELISA response to the RID docking tag is not actually a result of immunogenicity of the RID but of the peptides artificially introduced for affinity purification and cloning purposes. gD without RID was detected at a much lower dilution of the antisera. the antibody response was directed against HAgD. the highest reactivity was seen with the homologous PR8 (H1N1) antiserum. mRID-HAgD elicited specific antibodies against the homologous virus. repeated boosts with the fusion protein further amplified the antibody response. results suggest that recombinant RID-HAgD may serve as a good antigen for accurate diagnosis of infection. X-31 virus and surface HA and neuraminidase genes from WT viruses were used as the source of the HA antigen. ELISA data showing that according to the number of boosts, high-titer antibodies in serum samples from mice (n = 5) immunized with mRID-HAgD (20 g/mouse) bound to the PR8 (H1N1) virus (104 PFU/well) the mouse antisera against RID-HAgD showed detectable levels of HI titers and NT antibody titers. those from the RID-eGFP group failed to show such an activity. the HI activity appeared to be similar, regardless of the origin of the RID docking protein. an HI assay against the PR8 (H1N1) virus was performed on serum samples from mice (n = 3) immunized (intraperitoneally) with mRID-HAgD (20 g/mouse), PBS, or the HAgD without RID (15 g/mouse). the HI antibody titers increased 32-fold, depending on the number of immunization boosts with mRID-HAgD (20 g/m antisera from rabbits (n = 2) immunized with 1 mg of the rRID-HAgD recombinant vaccine showed higher HI titers than mouse antisera did (B) the control rabbit antisera (n = 2) after immunization with 1 mg of an RID-eGFP protein showed neither an HI ability nor NT antibodies against the homologous PR8 (H1N1) virus. immunization with the eLysRS-HAgD without RID (15 g) resulted in less protective efficacy compared with the mRID-HAgD. all of the immunized mice died within 8 dpc, and the viral titer remained high at 7 dpc. mice vaccinated intraperitoneally with 20 g of the mRID-HAgD immunogen (n = 5) or mock infected (PBS control; n = 5) were challenged with 1 times LD50 of the PR8 (H1N1) virus (103 PFUs) the body weight changes (A) and survival rates (B) of the infected mice were monitored daily. a convenient avenue for exploiting the chaperone activity of RNA for the folding of difficult-to-express proteins is to use RIDs that interact with known, identified RNA molecules for fusion with target proteins. the influenza HA antigen could be produced in bacteria as a soluble trimeric structure that can induce the production of NT antibodies for effective protection against a lethal challenge. an RID serves as a docking tag for transducing the chaperone function of RNA for the folding and assembly of the downstream reporter protein (HA). a judicious choice of an RID is required; the docking tag should not physically interfere with the formation of oligomeric structures. eLysRS-HAgD containing eLysRS as an alternative tRNA-binding domain were substantially higher. the fusion protein existed primarily as a dimer, as confirmed by gel-filtration chromatography. the stabilization energy of dimerization of the relatively large LysRS (57.6 kDa) may physically interfere with the trimerization of HAgD (47) the current approaches involve fusion of HA with ferritin into nanoparticles or with a foldon that is derived from the natural trimerization domain of isoleucine zippers or T4 fibritin (55\u201358), wherein the major amount of stabilization energy is provided by the external trimerization domain. in the present approach, the RID remains an independent monomer, and thus, it is not expected to contribute to intermolecular stabilization among HAgDs. the mechanism of the chaperna-mediated assembly of monomers should be explored further, although it is functionally similar to that of protein-based molecular chaperones. a chaperna is expected to function as a chaperone without the ATP requirement, in a way similar to that of the holdase type of chaperones (60\u201362). a chaperna is expected to function as a chaperone without the ATP requirement. the chaperna function may be extended to a supramolecular assembly of viral antigens, which is required for augmenting immunogenicity. the present strategy can be successfully applied to the assembly of bacterially synthesized monomers of a norovirus particle. however, prior cleavage of the RID tag was required to enable the compact packing into VLPs.
