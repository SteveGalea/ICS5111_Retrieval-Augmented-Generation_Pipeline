{"summary": "MERS is a lethal respiratory disease caused by MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) it occurs mostly in the Middle East, initially by camel-to-human transmission, then by human-to-human transmission. the disease was spread to other continents, probably by an index case, with subsequent pandemic outbreaks through human-to-human transmission. a leukocyte count of 5,570/mm3 (normal range 4,000\u201310,000/mm3) included a differential of 71.4% segmented neutrophils, 20.5% lymphocytes, and 7.9% monocytes; and C-reactive protein level of 1.95 mg/dL (normal range 0\u20130.3 mg/dL) there was no evidence of potential harm to the fetus and pregnant woman related to those drugs. placenta abruption was observed as dark blood clot on maternal side of placenta. a systematic testing procedure for coronavirus infection did not demonstrate the presence of MERS-CoV in the newborn. wk ICU/dead Dead/25 wk 7 (13) Saudi Arabia 22 wk No ICU/alive Alive/term (37 wk) MERS-CoV = Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, GA = gestational age, ICU = required intubation and intensive unit care. more than 1,698 confirmed cases were reported to the world health organization (WHO) negative MERS = Middle East respiratory syndrome, ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, IgG = immunoglobulin G, IIFT = indirect immunofluorescence test. there is limited knowledge about clinical implications of MERS-CoV infection on maternal, fetal, and placental aspects of pregnancy. there is no evidence of a relationship between MERS-CoV and placenta disorder. there are no data about perinatal transmission of MERS-CoV. there is only one case reporting the mother's serologic data previously."}
