{"summary": "serum PCT concentrations are associated with reduced risk of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults. no child with PCT 0.1 ng/mL had typical bacteria detected. lower PCT concentrations in children hospitalized with CAP were associated with a reduced risk of typical bacterial detection. the EPIC study was a multicenter, population-based study of radiographically confirmed CAP in children performed between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2012. virus, parainfluenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detected in an NP/OP swab by PCR or a 4-fold increase in agent-specific antibody titer between the acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum specimen obtained 3\u201310 weeks after discharge. a random sample of children with residual sera from groups 3 and 4 was included. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated for PCT cutoffs of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 ng/mL. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic likelihood ratios were calculated for PCT cutoffs of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 ng/mL. a \"typical\" bacterial pathogen was defined as S pneumoniae, S pyogenes, H influenzae, S aureus, specific viridans group streptococci, or Gram-negative bacteria detected in blood, high-quality endotracheal aspirates. a viral pathogen was defined as adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, or respiratory syncytial was performed using the VIDAS BRAHMS PCT assay. all PCT testing was performed retrospectively. clinical information was not available to the treating clinicians. all statistical analyses were performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Typical bacteria (with/without viral and/or atypical bacterial codetection) were detected in 54 (10%) children, atypical bacteria (with/without viral codetection) were detected in 82 (15%) children, and viruses alone were detected in 349 (66%) children. microbiological findings Typical bacterial pathogensb 54 (10%) 42 (11%) 13 (8%) Atypical bacterial pathogen(s)b 82 (15%) 60 (16%) 22 (14%) Viral pathogen(s) onlyc 349 (66%) 241 (64%) 107 (69%) No pathogen detected 47 (9%) 34 (9%) 13 (8%) Clinical characteristics Parapneumonic empyema 34 (6%) 24 (6%) 10 (6%) Intensive care unit admission 185 (35%) 120 IQR, 0.06\u20130.31), only viral pathogens detected (0.33 ng/mL; IQR, 0.12\u20131.35), or no pathogen detected (0.44 ng/mL; IQR, 0.10\u20131.83) compared with those with typical bacterial infection alone. vertical lines extending above and below the boxes are 1.5 times the interquartile range. 127 children (23% of cohort) with PCT concentrations 0.1 ng/mL, none had a typical bacterial pathogen detected. only 9 (7%) had a typical bacterial pathogen detected (P =.03) sensitivity of PCT for identification of children with typical bacterial CAP was 85% (95% CI, 72\u201393), with a specificity of 45% (95% CI, 40\u201350), a positive predictive value of 17% (95% CI, 13\u201323), and a negative predictive value of 96% (95% CI, 91\u201398). the median PCT concentration was significantly higher for children admitted to the ICU (0.61 ng/mL; IQR, 0.16\u20134.32). the median PCT concentration was significantly higher for children with CAP. procalcitonin was significantly higher among children with empyema (2.94 ng/mL; IQR, 0.70\u201332.06) compared with those without empyema (median, 0.27 ng/mL; IQR, 0.10\u20131.33) (P.001) among 120 children with a PCT concentration 0.1 ng/mL, 26 (22%) were admitted to the ICU and 1 had empyema. ng/mL 122 60 (49%) 20 (17%) 5.0 (2.8\u20138.9) Abreviations: CAP, community-acquired pneumonia; IQR, interquartile range; PCT, procalcitonin. ROC curves were constructed to assess discriminatory power of PCT concentrations in identifying children without typical bacterial pneumonia. studies have shown a correlation between higher PCT concentrations and the isolation of typical bacterial pathogens. studies in children have been less conclusive, with the highest levels again in bacteremic CAP. 65% of children with PCT concentrations 0.5 ng/mL had only a viral or atypical pathogen detected. despite the overlap at the high end of the PCT concentration range, however, at the low end (0.1 ng/mL) there were no detection of typical bacterial pathogens. characteristics of children hospitalized with CAP, low PCT, and Typical Bacterial Pathogens Detected Patient Number Age (Months) PCT (ng/mL) Intensive Care Unit Admission Length of Stay (Days) Bacterial Pathogen(s) detected Treated for Bacterial CAP. hMPV Yes Ceftriaxone and clindamycin initially, then clindamycin (4 weeks) 2 3 0. hMPV, human metapneumovirus; IQR, interquartile range; MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphyloccus aureus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PCT, procalcitonin. lower PCT concentrations were associated with less severe disease in our cohort based on ICU admission, parapneumonic empyema. study included 337 children with LRTI or CAP in 2 Swiss Emergency Departments. children were randomized (1) to receive therapy based on a PCT-guided algorithm. but rates of antibiotic initiation were similar in both groups. the negative predictive value of a PCT concentration 0.25 ng/mL was 96% (95% CI, 91\u201398), potentially limiting antibiotic use in 46% of children. clinicians will likely need to integrate PCT with other predictors of outcome and rapid etiologic diagnosis. a large cohort of 532 prospectively enrolled children with strictly defined, radiographically confirmed CAP accurately identified children at lower risk of typical bacterial CAP. our findings suggest that PCT may safely be integrated into treatment algorithms for children with CAP to reduce antibiotic administration and duration. the department of pediatrics at the University of Utah has created the Chris Stockmann Memorial Scholarship Fund in his honor to foster the career of other brilliant and passionate scientists dedicated to the care of children."}
