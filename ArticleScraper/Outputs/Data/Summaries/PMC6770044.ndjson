{"summary": "the global burden of inter-pandemic influenza is high. it is estimated to affect 1 billion people annually, with 3\u20135 million severe cases requiring hospitalization or intensive care treatment, resulting in approximately 0.5 million deaths. alternative strategies are needed against severe influenza infections during both seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks. we have previously developed an air\u2013liquid interface (ALI) human airway epithelial cell culture that is able to sustain influenza infection. compared the transcriptomic responses of our infected human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) with 15 other in vitro and in vivo influenza infection transcriptomic studies. the comparison revealed that at their peak responses against influenza, the differential transcriptome signature in hNECs was highly similar to the signatures from other influenza infection models. hNESPCs were isolated and enriched from the tissue biopsies according to a previously standardized protocol [5,15], which normalized the hNESPCs to a baseline state that differentiates into hNECs resembling healthy tissues. the hNESPCs were expanded further and subjected to ALI culture in Transwells for in vitro differentiation according to previous protocol. the expanded hNESPCs were then transferred onto 12-well 0.4 m Transwell inserts. after 3\u20134 weeks of differentiation, hNECs from a total of seven donors were then subject to influenza H3N2 virus infection. the control hNECs were harvested for apical wash and RNA prior to the infection at 0 h post-infection (hpi) the infected hNECs were then harvested for the apical wash and RNA. plates were rocked every 15 min to ensure equal viral distribution. total RNA was extracted from the lysate using mirVana miRNA isolation kit. qPCR analysis was performed to evaluate the transcriptional levels of host response genes selected based on previous microarray analysis using pre-designed primers. cDNA libraries were prepared using 2 ng of total RNA and 1 L of a 1:50,000 dilution of ERCC RNA Spike in Controls using SMARTSeq v2 protocol [16] except for the following modifications: (1) Use of 20 M TSO, (2) use of 250 pg of cDNA with 1/5 reaction of Illumina Nextera XT kit. sixteen samples were subject to an indexed PE sequencing run of 2 51 cycles on an Illumina HiS Luminex assay was performed on apical supernatant collected from both uninfected control and infected hNECs at 8, 24, and 48 hpi. the panel included the detection of: human sCD40L, EGF, FGF-2, Flt-3 ligand, Fractalkine, G-CSF, GRO, IFN-2, IFN-, IL-1, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-3, IL the hNESPCs were isolated and enriched from the tissue biopsies according to a previously standardized protocol [5,15], which normalized the hNESPCs to a baseline state that differentiates into hNECs resembling healthy tissues. the hNESPCs were expanded further and subjected to ALI culture in Transwells for in vitro differentiation according to a previously standardized protocol. ng/mL of human epithelial growth factor (EGF), 5 g/mL of insulin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.1 nM of cholera toxin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.5 g/mL of hydrocortisone (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 2 nM/mL of 3,3\u2032,5-triiodo-l-thyronine the control hNECs were harvested for apical wash and RNA prior to the infection at 0 h post-infection (hpi) the infected hNECs were then harvested for apical wash and RNA following 8, 24, and 48 hpi incubation at 35 \u00b0C. total RNA was extracted from the lysate using mirVana miRNA isolation kit. qPCR analysis was performed

sixteen samples were subject to an indexed PE sequencing run of 2 51 cycles on an Illumina HiSeq Luminex assay was performed on apical supernatant collected from both uninfected control and infected hNECs at 8, 24, and 48 hpi using the Multiplexing Immunoassay Human Cytokine/Chemokine Panel 1, 41-plex. samples and standards were incubated with fluorescent-coded magnetic beads which had been pre-coated with the respective capture antibodies. data analysis was done on bio-Plex ManagerTM 6.1.1 (Bio-Rad) results were expressed as mean fold change compared with uninfected control. the responses of all seven hNECs donors following influenza infection were plotted on a principal component analysis (PCA) plot. at 8 hpi, there were 31 upregulated genes and 13 downregulated genes. the major upregulated genes were the antiviral sensors and early response genes such as IFNs, IFITs, and IFIs. at later time points, the number of gene expression changes increased substantially. one gene had a p-value of 0.1 (CTGF), while only two genes were not statistically significant (TGFA and ANO5). the number of significant genes over 10-fold (>Log2FC of 3.4) 3 (2; 1) 99 (91; 8) 167 (112) two thirds of genes at 8 and 24 hpi overlapped with other time points. about one third of genes at 48 hpi overlapped. overlapping genes displayed similar directional consistency at significant time points. the changes of the genes became more consistent overtime and showed same directional changes and clustering at 48 hpi. at time points 8, 24, and 48 hpi, there were 3, 41, and 30 significant (adjusted p-value 0.05) GO biological processes. at the early time of 8 hpi, interferon-mediated antiviral responses were elevated as expected.

RNAseq analysis facilitates more accurate expression changes following infection compared to hybridization technology such as microarray. all but one of the 11 gene signatures exhibited elevated expression of >2.5-fold change (>1.33 Log2FC) compared to uninfected control hNECs. future studies on early transcriptional alterations could consider adopting the 2.5-fold change in expression as a more stringent threshold. however, future studies could consider adopting the 2.5-fold change in expression as a more stringent threshold. significant gene expression changes (>2.5-fold change) following influenza infection. red bars indicate the number of upregulated genes, while blue bars indicate the number of downregulated genes. the number of significant gene expression changes peaked at 48 hpi. gene name Microarray LogFC 48 h Microarray FDR 48 h RNAseq LogFC 48 h RNAseq FDR 48 h ZBP1 1.30628 1.04 106 6.97086 2.70 108 IFI6 3.78685 6.67 106 6.30199 1.80 1023 CD38 3.61175 5.88 107 5.699259 2.10 1010 MX1 3.17584 1.57 108 5.339009 3.48 1017 transcriptomes by RNAseq, we then investigated whether changes in expression of genes resulted in alterations in secretory cytokines and chemokines early in the infection of hNECs. at 24 and 48 hpi, less significant changes were observed, i.e., only increase in TNF-a and decrease in MDC and PDGF-AA were noted at 24 hpi. infected hNECs were observed with strong activation of antiviral genes and early inflammatory genes leading to type I immune responses. despite the absence of immune cells, the infected hNECs were able to generate strong type I responses that may likely aid the recruitment of cytotoxic cells. RNAseq also unraveled expression changes of certain newly-discovered genes in response to influenza infection of the upper airway cells. RNAseq identified altered expression of ART3 and KCNH7 genes that were not previously detected in influenza transcriptomes. production of IFN response factors such as ICAM1 and CD44 may contribute to inflammatory damage of the epithelium. the primary contact of influenza virus with the nasal epithelium may subsequently lead to damage to the airway epithelium. this is apparent with the clear enrichment of the pathways of apoptosis, mitochondrial apoptotic processes and necroptosis that contribute to cell death. changes in expression of certain growth factors (including EREG and FGFs) following influenza infection may lead to complications involving airway remodeling and recruitment. changes to airway smooth muscle cells are usually implicated in airway remodeling [41,42,43], and may also contribute to post-influenza complications. another interesting pathway that may contribute to epithelial damage is the negative regulation of innate immune responses. infected hNECs also revealed modified responses associated with fatty acid. changes in these pathways may also suggest a potential mechanistic link to pathogenesis of viral-induced exacerbation of chronic inflammatory diseases. expression of cytokines was reduced at 8 hpi, except for IL-15. only TGF-a, IP-10 (CXCL10) and PDGF-AA were significantly altered at 24 and 48 hpi. this may be significant markers that can be detected in the secretion of influenza-infected mucosal surface. gene expression changes of significant magnitude and pathways that impact responses against influenza and its severity. these genes may represent novel targets for future diagnostic and therapeutic development. hNECs clinically establish the baseline for \u201cnormal\u201d innate immune responses against influenza."}
