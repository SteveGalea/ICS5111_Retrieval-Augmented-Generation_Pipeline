{"summary": "a trend in clinical tropical medicine research is to look beyond traditional referral centers and their patient populations, out into the communities. this new approach, using community involvement and practice-based research networks, has the potential to challenge assumptions and uncover new strategies for improving the health of the individual. 1/5 of patients with fever in highland Uganda had parasitemia. severe malaria manifested as shock and lactic acidosis more commonly than severe anemia. lago et al.8 Geriatric treatment Individuals aged 60\u201385 years responded equally compared with persons aged 18\u201340 years but had increased cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac overload. Mitchell et al.17 Refugee health Refugees in three Thailand\u2013Burma border camps were screened and treated for intestinal parasites, evaluated for chronic hepatitis B. rum and 98.2% of P. vivax cases by day 2 were 97.7% and 98.2% respectively. no genes associated with resistance were detected. some interesting trends were noted in the articles that emerged through this process. one of the themes was the importance of doing clinical research outside of referral centers. the findings may not have been surprising in terms of efficacy and tolerability in children compared with young adults. the committee was attempting to predict the future by identifying the work that will have the greatest effect on health in the tropics. the committee was attempting to predict the future by identifying the work that will have the greatest effect on health in the tropics."}
