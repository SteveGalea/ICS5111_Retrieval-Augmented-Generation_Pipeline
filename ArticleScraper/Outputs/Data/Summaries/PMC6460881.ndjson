{"summary": "the emergence of new IB virus (IB) variants may lead to mismatching between vaccine virus strain and circulating virus strain, this may be a reason of vaccination failure. a total of 47 viral isolate samples collected from chickens with clinical sign and reduced in egg production. IB is a poultry disease caused by Coronavirus of Nidovirales order. all Coronaviruses have four structural proteins, glycoprotein spike, matrix, nucleoprotein, and envelope consist of lipid bilayer and three glycoproteins. spike protein S1 undergoes inhibitor of agglutination and induces neutralizing antibody. the majority of IBV strain isolated in Indonesia were related to Massachusetts (Mass) and Connecticut (Conn), and serotype N2/62 originated from Australia [10], IBV local isolates [11], IBV close to vaccine virus strain 4/91 [12], and IBV originated from Taiwan and China [8]. however, limited information available about IBV strain circulating among poultry in Indonesia and its genetic character. the expected PCR product size is 466 bp. nucleotide sequencing About 30 l each of RT-PCR product of amplified S1 sequenced using BigDye\u00ae Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit. the samples were organ, cloacal swab, and tracheal swab. the vaccine represents IBV strain H120, H52, 4/91, CR88, 233A. the RNAs were dissolved in 50 l RNase-free water and stored at 20\u00b0C. the RNAs were directly used for subsequent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) ide sequence results are compiled, aligned, and compared with sequence of S1 gene of control positive and also with sequence data of S1 gene of published IBV available in the GenBank. phylogenetic trees were constructed using maximum likelihood of the general time reversible model of MEGA 7 software. isolates Indonesia/K4A9/17 and Indonesia/K233A31/18 have 100% homology with IBV vaccine strain 4/91. the deviation between Indonesia/K4A9/17 and Indonesia/K233A31/18 was 0%. there was no deletion or insertion occurred inside the S1 genes. isolates Indonesia/K4A9/17 and Indonesia/K233A31/18 were likely belonged to IBV close to vaccine strain 4/91. other isolates Indonesia/P3/17 likely belonged to IBV close to vaccine strain 233A. the emergence of IBV variants in Indonesia was first detected by Dharmayanti et al. and later on, the study of IBV variants was conducted by Dharmayanti and Indriani [8] which detected IBV variants close to Taiwan and China strain. the study of IBV variants was conducted by Dharmayanti et al. 1 gene of IBV Indonesia/K4A9/17 was 100% identical with vaccine strain 4/91. IBV Indonesia/P3/17 was 100% identical to vaccine strain 233A. no mutation, insertion, or deletion detected in nucleotide sequence of IBV isolates in this study. all authors contributed in writing and revision of the manuscript. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
