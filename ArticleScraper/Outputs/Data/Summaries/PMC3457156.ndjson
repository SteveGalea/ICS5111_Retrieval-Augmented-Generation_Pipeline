{"summary": "avian and swine influenza viruses (28, 41), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (17), and human immunodeficiency virus (16, 51) cause epidemics (or pandemics) in humans by changing or expanding host range. zoonotic viral pathogens such as hantaviruses and rabies virus show high genetic diversity. hantaviruses are considered to have coevolved (cospeciated) with their respective rodent or insectivore hosts (20, 21, 23, 25, 38, 39, 39, 43, 44, 52) similarities between hantaviruses and their hosts are the result of a more recent history of preferential host switching and local adaptation. dabieshan (or da Bie Shan) virus (DBSV) was first isolated from Niviventer confucianus (Chinese white-bellied rat) captured in the Dabieshan mountainous area of Anhui Province, China (61) genetically, the virus is more closely related to HTNV, carried by Apodemus mice (15% amino acid difference), than to SEOV, carried by Rattus rats (>25% amino acid difference), where DBSV was initially recognized as rodents were captured in the mountains in wencheng and Yongjia counties. small animals were trapped using a cage (20 cm by 20 cm by 56 cm) with a treadle release mechanism using deep-fried dough sticks as bait. a genomic DNA extraction kit was used to extract mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from rat lung tissue samples according to manufacturer's instructions. primer P14 (49) was used to synthesize cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. al W was used to estimate phylogenetic trees using the DNAStar program. a general time-reversible (GTR) model with a gamma distribution of site rate heterogeneity was found to be the best model for the open reading frame (ORF) of the S segment and GTR + to be best for the ORF of the M segment. the Bayesian MCMC approach available in the BEAST v1.6.0 software package (14) was used to estimate the rates of nucleotide substitution and divergence time (i.e., time to most recent common ancestor [TMRCA] in Murinae-associated hantaviruses for the S and M segments. the Bayes factor (BF) was estimated to determine the best clock and tree prior model with Tracer v1.5. an uncorrected log-normal distribution relaxed molecular clock model and extended Bayesian Skyline tree prior were used for both ORF sequences of the S and M segments. omyscus simus 18 70 DOBV Apodemus flavicllis 1 10 SAAV A. agrarius 2 14 THAIV Bandicota indica 1 27 SERV R. rattus, R. tanezumi 1 18 SEOV Rattus norvegicus 2 8 ASV A. peninsulae 1 10 SANGV + DOBV + SAAV H. simus, Apodemus spp. 14 28 THAIV + SEOV + the program codeml in the PAML 4.4c software package was employed to detect positively selected sites. in each hantavirus species, several sequences were selected for detection of positive selection. no sequence was identical to the others (57). there were three ratios for the foreground (0 0 1, 1 = 1, and 2 > 1) and two ratios for background (0 0 1 and 1 = 1) in branch-site model A. the null model (model A\u2032) was the same as model A except that 2 = 1 was fixed. RNA was detected using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as described by Klempa et al. (27). locations of trap sites where DBSV was detected are shown as triangles (). TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to extract total RNA from viral antigen-positive lung tissue samples according to manufacturer's instructions. in RDP3 (33) were employed to detect potential recombinant viral sequences, identify likely parental viral sequences, and localize possible recombination breakpoints. when events were observed with two or more methods and with significant phylogenetic support, the viral sequences were considered recombinant and were excluded from this study. sian trees were readdressed to construct a tanglegram of rodent host and associated hantavirus using TreeMap software (2.0b) the model was used to test significance by reconstructing 1,000 hantavirus trees with randomized branches and mapping these random trees onto the fixed host tree. when the level of congruence of the \u201creal\u201d virus tree was no more than that expected between randomly generated trees. two independent runs were taken for each data set, with sampling every 1,000 generations. a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree with a burn-in of 10% of the sampled trees was constructed. amino acids deduced from S and M segment sequences were aligned using MegAlign in the DNAStar program. if a specific amino acid exists in one species or one group, this amino acid is considered a \u201csignature amino acid\u201d marker (or synapomorphy). mus spp. 16 35

DBSV is carried by N. confucianus, in which no other hantaviruses have been found. hantaviruses share more signature amino acid than any other Hantavirus species or group of species, suggesting that they share an ancestor. Niviventer rats have a closer evolutionary relationship with Rattus rats than with Apodemus mice. phylogeny of DBSV, HTNV, and SEOV is not consistent with their respective hosts. cross-species transmission plays an important role in the speciation of the known Murinae-associated hantaviruses. both stochastic events (e.g., genetic drift or bottleneck) and deterministic processes (e.g., selection or adaptation) are occurring in a population. even weak selection on a mutant may play an important role in its evolution. hantavirus species or genetic lineages of the same species can possess specific amino acid \u201csignatures\u201d such as those in the N protein sequences for Puumala virus (52) or the GPC protein sequences for HTNV (73). despite advances in understanding the patterns and processes of microevolution, little is known about the determinants of viral diversification at the macroevolutionary scale. several studies show that within host populations both pathogen and host are able to adapt in response to the interactions, resulting in coevolution (18, 56, 58, 63) there is also a debate on how the microevolutionary changes can influence the patterns of speciation of the interacting species at the macroevolutionary levels (26)."}
