{"summary": "influenza A viruses are a major cause of acute infection of the respiratory tract that affects millions of people during seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. pigs are susceptible to infection due to the presence of both N-acetylneuraminic acids linked to galactose. pigs were recognized as intermediate hosts and considered mixing vessels that play an important role in the emergence of new influenza viruses with pandemic potential (7\u201311). HA is synthesized as precursor protein HA0, which must be cleaved by a host cell protease into the HA1 and HA2 subunits to gain its fusion capacity. HA cleavage is essential for virus infectivity and spread (12, 13) primary porcine tracheal epithelial cells (PTECs) and porcine bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) identified HA-activating proteases in the respiratory tract of swine. proteases homologous to TMPRSS2 and swine TMPRSS2 are expressed in these cells and are able to activate influenza A viruses with a monobasic cleavage site. swAT revealed that the cleavage of HA may occur by similar proteases and at similar stages during the viral life cycle in airway epithelial cells of swine and human. primary porcine airway epithelial cells were obtained from tracheas and bronchi of 4- to 6-month-old pigs from a butchery. epithelial cells were harvested by scraping the luminal surface with a scalpel. cells were resuspended in porcine airway epithelial cell growth medium. cells were seeded into type I collagen (BD Biosciences)-coated cell culture flasks. influenza viruses A/Memphis/14/96 (H1N1) and pSG(5):bfur-furin encoding bovine furin were used in this study. DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, glutamine, and antibiotics. cell supernatants were cleared by low-speed centrifugation and stored at 80\u00b0C. total RNA was isolated from either primary PEECs, PTECs, and PBECs or porcine lung tissue using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) RT-PCR was carried out with 2 g of total RNA using a one-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) primers specific for swine -tubulin were used. cDNAs encoding swTMPRSS2 or swAT were cloned from total RNA of primary PBECs by RT-PCR using primers specific for swTMPRSS2 or swAT. 293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS-swTMPRSS2-FLAG, pCAGGS-swAT-FLAG, pCAGGS-TMPRSS2 and swAT. 293T cells were seeded in 12-well plates and cotransfected with pCAGGS-H1 and either pCAGGS-swTMPRSS2 or pCAGGS-swAT for 48 h. as a control, HA-expressing cells were treated with 10 g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. -conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako), followed by incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence peroxidase substrate (Pierce) and exposure of the membrane to autoradiography films (CEA). infected cells were immunostained using a NP-specific antibody and a species-specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. representative images were recorded using a Nikon Eclipse TS 100 microscope. primary cell cultures were inoculated with virus at a low MOI of 0.001 to 0.0001 in PAEGM for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were rinsed with PBS and mounted on microscope slides using the Mowiol reagent (Calbiochem) coexpressed swTMPRSS2 and swAT were detected using polyclonal FLAG antiserum (Sigma) and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako) primary antibodies were visualized by using species-specific FITC- and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. MDCK cells were grown in 96-well plates and transfected with either pCAGGS-swTMPRSS2 or pCAGGS-swAT. at 24 h p.t., cells were washed with PBS and protease activity was assayed by incubation of cells with the fluorogenic peptide substrate Boc\u2013Gly\u2013Pro\u2013Arg\u20137-amino-4-methylcumarin (Bachem) at a final primary porcine airway epithelial cells were obtained from tracheas and bronchi of 4- to 6-month-old pigs from a butchery. preparation of respiratory epithelial cells was based on modified isolation protocols previously described. cells were resuspended in porcine airway epithelial cell growth medium. they were filtered through a 250-m-pore-size polyester monolen mesh filter. cells were seeded into type I collagen (BD Biosciences)-coated cell culture flasks. influenza virus A/Memphis/14/96 (H1N1) containing noncleaved HA0 was generated by infection of MDCK cells in the absence of trypsin. RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis. swTMPRSS2 and swAT-specific mRNA were assessed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). primers specific for swine -tubulin were used for detection of mRNAs. TMPRSS2 (GenBank accession number BAF76737.1) or swAT (predicted sequence; GenBank accession number XM_003129055.3) were cloned from total RNA of primary PBECs by RT-PCR using primers specific for swTMPRSS2 or swAT. 293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS-swTMPRSS2-FLAG, pCAGGS- 293T cells were seeded in 12-well plates and cotransfected with pCAGGS-H1 and either pCAGGS-swTMPRSS2 or pCAGGS-swAT for 48 h. as a control, HA-expressing cells were treated with 10 g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin in PBS for 30 min. Virus-containing supernatants cleared from cell debris by low-speed centrifugation. resuspended in reducing SDS sample buffer, heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. polyclonal rabbit serum against H1 was derived from rabbits immunized with A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) cells were culated with virus at a low MOI of 0.001 to 0.0001 in PAEGM for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. samples of PTEC and PBEC supernatants were treated with 1 g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol-acetone (1:1) and blocked by incubation with 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) coexpressed swTMPRSS2 and swAT were detected using polyclonal FLAG antiserum (Sigma) and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. endogenous swTMPRSS2 and swAT were detected with a polyclonal anti-TMPRSS2 or anti-HAT serum (Genovac GmbH), respectively. at 24 h p.t., cells were washed with PBS and protease activity was assayed by incubation of cells with the fluorogenic peptide substrate Boc\u2013Gly\u2013Pro\u2013Arg\u20137-amino-4-methylcumarin (Bachem) at a final concentration of 25 M in DMEM for 45, 90, and 150 min at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. RESULTS Proteolytic activation of influenza viruses by endogenous proteases in primary PTECs and PBECs. primary PTECs and PBECs were infected with human influenza virus A/Hamburg (H1N1)pdm09 or A/Aichi (H3N2) and incubated for 24 h. trypsin treatment revealed no marked increase of virus titers from PBECs and only slightly higher titers in PTEC supernatants. HA0 was completely cleaved by trypsin (Fig. 2C) progeny virus released from primary PTECs and PBECs is already efficient by endogenous proteases. cultures of primary PTECs and PBECs were infected with influenza virus isolate A/Hamburg (H1N1)pdm09 or A/Aichi (H3N2) at an MOI of 0.003 to 0.007 and incubated for 24 h to allow multiple cycles of virus replication. infected cells were immunostained against the viral NP. alignments of human and swine proteases revealed 77% homology between swTMPRSS2 and TMPRSS2 and 81% homology between swTMPRSS2 and TMPRSS2. total RNA was isolated from epiglottic, tracheal, or bronchial epithelial cells and porcine lung tissue. swAT-specific mRNA was found in epithelial cells of the epiglottis, trache swTMPRSS2 and swAT were expressed as full-length proteins of 60 kDa and 47 kDa respectively. the results suggest that swTMPRSS2 and swAT are expressed as enzymatically active proteases in 293T cells. total RNA was isolated from PEECs, PTECs, and PBECs. each protease was coexpressed with the HA of the 2009 pandemic virus A/Hamburg (H1N1)pdm09 in 293T cells for 48 h. coexpression of either swTMPRSS2 or swAT resulted in cleavage of the precursor protein HA0 (75 kDa) into the subunits HA1 (55 kDa) and HA2 (25 kDa), similar to treatment of swTMPRSS2 and swAT are expressed as enzymatically active proteases. they are able to activate influenza virus HA with a monobasic cleavage site. swTMPRSS2 and swAT belong to type II transmembrane proteases. swTMPRSS2 and swAT were expressed on the cell surface (32) to determine cell surface expression of swTMPRSS2 and swAT. swTMPRSS2 and swAT were transient expressed in permeabilized MDCK cells for 24 h. swTMPRSS2 and swAT were transiently coexpressed in Huh7 cells. swTMPRSS2 and furin were detected at the plasma membrane of primary PTECs and PBECs. expression of endogenous swTMPRSS2 at the cell surface appeared to be less distinctive. swTMPRSS2 is present at the cell surface as well but accumulates in the TGN. swTMPRSS2 is present at the cell surface as well but accumulates in the TGN. MDCK cells were transfected with either pCAGGS-swTMPRSS2-FLAG or pCAGGS-swAT-FLAG. at 24 h p.t., cell surface expression of swTMPRSS2 and swAT was analyzed. clonal TMPRSS2 and swAT antisera and FITC-labeled secondary antibodies were visualized with anti-TMPRSS2 or anti-HAT serum. swTMPRSS2 and swAT were shown to be expressed at the plasma membrane. only HAT was found to exhibit enzymatic activity on the cell surface (17) at 24 h p.i., cells were immunostained against NP and counted. cells expressing swAT could be efficiently infected with virus containing HA0. swTMPRSS2-expressing cells failed to activate incoming virions containing HA0. MDCK cells transiently expressing swTMPRSS2, swAT, and HAT (B) and primary PTEC and PBEC monolayers were inoculated with human influenza virus isolate A/Memphis (H1N1) and incubated for 10 h at 37\u00b0C to allow a single cycle of replication. primary PTECs and PBECs were infected with human influenza virus A/Hamburg (H1N1)pdm09 or A/Aichi (H3N2) and incubated for 24 h. immunofluorescence staining of the epithelial marker protein cytokeratin and adherens junction protein E-cadherin showed the typical comet-like spread of infection. trypsin treatment revealed no marked increase of virus titers from PBECs. HA0 was completely cleaved by trypsin. results demonstrate that progeny virus released from primary PTECs and PBECs is already efficiently activated by endogenous proteases. swine genome encodes proteases homologous to human HA-activating proteases TMPRSS2 and swine airway trypsin-like protease. proteases swTMPRSS2 and swAT are expressed in different parts of the porcine respiratory tract. PCR products specific for swTMPRSS2 were amplified from all tested airway tissues. swAT-specific mRNA was found in epithelial cells of the epiglottis, trachea, and bronchi. only a small amount of swAT mRNA was detected in the lung tissue. 293T cells were transfected with either empty pCAGGS plasmid (mock) or pCAGGS encoding either swTMPRSS2-FLAG, swAT-FLAG, TMPRSS2-FLAG, or HAT-FLAG. the results suggest that swTMPRSS2 and swAT are expressed as enzymatically active proteases in 293T cells. the HA of the 2009 pandemic virus A/Hamburg (H1N1)pdm09 in 293T cells for 48 h. coexpression of either swTMPRSS2 or swAT resulted in cleavage of the precursor protein HA0 (75 kDa) into the subunits HA1 (55 kDa) and HA2 (25 kDa), similar to treatment of HA-expressing cells with trypsin 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding HA of A/Hamburg (H1N1)pdm09 and either pCAGGS-swTMPRSS2 or pCAGGS-swAT. at 48 h p.t., HA cleavage was detected by Western blot analysis of cell lysates using HA-specific antibodies. treatment of HA-expressing cells with trypsin served as both swTMPRSS2 and swAT were expressed at the plasma membrane. swTMPRSS2 and swAT were transiently coexpressed in permeabilized MDCK cells. swTMPRSS2 and swAT were transiently coexpressed in Huh7 cells. swTMPRSS2 and swAT were detected at the plasma membrane of primary PTECs and PBECs. expression of endogenous swTMPRSS2 at the cell surface appeared to be less distinctive, and the protease seemed to accumulate within the cell, whereas prominent surface staining was found for swAT. MDCK cells transiently expressing swTMPRSS2 and swAT were fixed and permeabilized. swTMPRSS2 and swAT transiently coexpressed in permeabilized Huh7 cells were visualized by polyclonal FLAG and HAT antisera. human proteases TMPRSS2 and swAT were shown to be expressed at the plasma membrane. but only HAT was found to exhibit enzymatic activity on the cell surface (17). swTMPRSS2 seemed to possess low levels of proteolytic activity, if any, at the plasma membrane. cells expressing swAT could be efficiently infected with virus containing HA0. swTMPRSS2-expressing cells failed to activate incoming virions containing noncleaved HA0. proteolytic activation of incoming virus was examined in primary PTECs and PBECs. PRSS2, swAT, or HAT as the control, the cells were incubated with the fluorogenic peptide substrate Boc-Gly-Pro-Arg-AMC. the results are the mean enzymatic activities for three independent experiments, with values for mock-transfected cells subtracted from values for protease-expressing cells. proteases swTMPRSS2 and swTMPRSS2 were assumed to be homologues of the human HA-activating proteases HAT and TMPRSS2 respectively. swTMPRSS2 was cloned by using a predicted nucleotide sequence from porcine genome databases. both proteases are expressed in the epiglottis, trachea, and bronchi of pigs. TMPRSS2 is widely expressed in respiratory tissues, including the nose, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lung (34, 36\u201338). expression of HAT was reported to be prominent in the trachea and bronchi. expression of TMPRSS2 was reported to be prominent in the trachea and bronchi. it remains unclear if HAT is present in the lung or not. microscopy of recombinant and endogenous swTMPRSS2 showed that the protease accumulates within the cell and colocalizes with the TGN-residing proteins TGN38 and furin (29, 33). the missing enzymatic activity of surface-expressed swTMPRSS2 and its localization in the TGN strongly suggest that the protease cleaves HA in the plasma membrane. the TMPRSS2-related protease TMPRSS4 was shown to cleave influenza virus HA with a monobasic cleavage site in vitro (46) the TTSP matriptase is widely expressed in epithelial tissues in human and mouse (47, 48) the combination of the protease inhibitor benzylsulfonyl-d-arginine-proline-4-amidinobenzylamide (BAPA) and the current NA inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate was synergistic and blocked influenza virus propagation in human airway epithelial cells. HA activation in the airways of swine and human shows a high similarity in respect to the relevant proteases, compartmentalization,"}
