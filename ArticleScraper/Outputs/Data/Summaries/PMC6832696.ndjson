{"summary": "emerging and re-emerging viruses surface from natural reservoirs and kill people. influenza A virus (FLUAV), human immunodeficiency (HIV-1), herpes simplex (HSV) and other viruses regularly infect human population and represent substantial public health and economic burden. we also tested 55 BSAAs against EV1, ezetimibe, and azacytidine, cyclosporine, minocycline, oritavancin, and ritonavir against RVFV. we identified novel activities for dalbavancin against EV1, ezetimibe against HIV-1 and ZIKV, and azacytidine, cyclosporine, minocycline, oritavancin human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial cells were grown in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and Pen/Strep. human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and Pen/Strep. DMEM containing 10% FBS, Pen/Strep, and 10 g/mL puromycin. all cell lines were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C. EV1 (Farouk strain; ATCC) was from Prof. Marjom\u00e4ki. EV1 was amplified in a monolayer of A549 cells in the DMEM media. the cells were grown for 24 h in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. the medium was replaced with DMEM-F12 medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. HSV-2-infected cells were imaged after 72 h in phase-contrast mode. RVFV-mediated RFP expression and FLUAV-mediated GFP expression were visualized after 24 h. HMPV-mediated GFP expression was recorded after 96 h using fluorescent microscopy. the cells were grown for 24 h in cell growth medium. no compounds were added to the control wells. the cells were infected with HIV-1 or mock. the threshold of SI used to differentiate between active and inactive compounds was 3. 2.6. Drug Combination Experiment RPE cells were treated with increasing concentrations of obatoclax and emetine. the cells were infected with FLUAV-GFP at moi 0.5. after 24 h, GFP fluorescence was recorded using fluorescent microscopy. 108 molecules inhibit the replication of several viruses in man. most recently, novel antiviral activities have been reported for some of these agents. human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, Pen/Strep, and 10 g/mL puromycin. all cell lines were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. all the experiments with viruses were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the national authorities using appropriate biosafety laboratories. one-trypsin (TPCK)-trypsin was amplified in a monolayer of vero-e6 cells. EV1 was amplified in a monolayer of A549 cells in the DMEM media. the cells were seeded in 10 mL medium. phenylhalamide, ABT-263 and DMSO were added to the control wells. DMSO is an inhibitor of cellular vacuolar ATPase, which protects cells from virus-mediated death. DMSO is an inhibitor of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. approximately 4 104 TZM-bl cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate. TZM-bl cells express firefly luciferase under control of HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter. f(x) is a response value at dose x, Amin and Amax are the upper and lower asymptotes. m is the dose that produces the half-maximal effect (EC50 or CC50) a relative effectiveness of the drug was defined as selectivity index (SI = CC50/EC50) BSAAs inhibit the replication of 52 viruses belonging to single-stranded (ss)RNA, (+)ssRNA, ssRNA-reverse transcriptase (RT), ssDNA, double-stranded (ds)DNA, or dsDNA-RT virus groups. BSAAs range from the highest to lowest number of targeted viruses. the sis for obatoclax, emetine, niclosamide and ganciclovir were 12, 37, 3 and >750 respectively. 0.12 M obatoclax, 0.04 M emetine, 0.37 M niclosamide and 0.37 M ganciclovir lowered the production of HSV-2 in RPE cells. so, we identified novel anti-HSV-2 activities of obatoclax, emetine and ganciclo obatoclax, emetine, and homoharringtonine rescued cells from virus-mediated death at none-cytotoxic concentrations. the sis for obatoclax, emetine, and homoharringtonine were 25, >300, and >300 respectively. emetine (0.12 M), homoharringtonine (0.12 M) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were measured by plaque assay using the Luciferase Assay System (Mean SD; n = 3). we also examined the toxicity and antiviral activity of 43 BSAAs against HIV-1-mediated firefly luciferase expression. obatoclax and emetine inhibited RVFV-mediated RFP expression at non-cytotoxic concentrations. the si for obatoclax was >100, and the SI for emetine was >75. emetine inhibited RVFV-mediated RFP expression at non-cytotoxic concentrations. the SI for obatoclax was six and for emetine was 10. obatoclax and emetine were treated with increasing concentrations of a compound and infected with HMPV-GFP (moi, 0.1) after 24 h, the cells were imaged and fluorescence intensity was quantified. cells were imaged and fluorescence intensity was quantified. cell viability was determined with the CTG assay (Mean SD; n = 3). obatoclax and emetine targets distinct cellular pathways essential for virus infection. stranded; single-stranded; RT, reverse transcriptase; ss, single-stranded. obatoclax, emetine, niclosamide and ganciclovir Inhibit HSV-2 Replication in RPE cells. the viability of the cells was determined to be 72 hpi with the CTG assay. the viability of the cells was determined to be 72 hpi with the CTG assay. all three compounds lowered the production of EV1. the viability of the cells was determined to be 48 hpi with the CTG assay. si for suramin was >375 (Figure 4; Table S4). we identified novel activity of brequinar and confirmed known activity of suramin. obatoclax and emetine inhibited RVFV-mediated RFP expression. RPE cells were treated with increasing concentrations of a compound and infected with RVFV-RFP (moi, 0.1) after 24 h, the cells were imaged and fluorescence intensity was quantified (Mean SD; n = 3). after 72 h, the cells were imaged and fluorescence intensity was quantified. obatoclax and emetine lowered GFP expression without detectable cytotoxicity. we repeated the experiment with these compounds and confirmed initial hits. we identified novel anti-FLUAV activity of emetine and confirmed known activity of obatoclax. ssRNA and dsDNA viruses identified novel activities for five agents. we identified novel activities of niclosamide against HSV-2, brequinar against HIV-1, homoharringtonine against EV1, obatoclax against HSV-2, EV1, HMPV and RVFV. we also confirmed antiviral activities of ganciclovir against HSV-2, suramin against HIV-1, and obatoclax against FLUAV. obatoclax inhibited viral endocytic uptake by targeting cellular induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl-1. it could be pursued as a potential BSAA candidate. emetine can directly inhibit viral polymerases, though it may have other targets. emetine also inhibits FLUAV, RVFV, EV1, HMPV and HSV-2. niclosamide induces endosomal neutralization and prevents virus entry into host cells. the human non-malignant RPE cell line represents an excellent model system for studying the infection of different viruses. different viral strains expressing reporter proteins, such as RVFV-RFP, HMPV-GFP and FLUAV-GFP, are excellent tools for drug screening. BSAAs could have a global impact by decreasing morbidity and mortality from viral and other diseases. maximizing the number of healthy life years, improving the quality of life of infected patients and decreasing the costs of patient care."}
