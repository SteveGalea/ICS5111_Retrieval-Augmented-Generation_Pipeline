{"summary": "the typical drug discovery and development cycle, from concept to market, takes approximately 14 years1. the cost ranges from 0.8 to 1.0 billion USD2. rapid developments in combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening technologies have provided an environment to expedite the drug discovery process. LBDD methods, such as molecular docking and de novo drug design, rely on the knowledge of the structure of the target macromolecule, which are obtained from crystal structures. pharmacophore modeling, molecular field analysis and 2D or 3D similarity assessment can provide crucial insights into the nature of the interactions between drug targets and ligands. the development of TarFisDock was based on the widely used docking program, DOCK (version 4.0)19,20. this platform consists of a front-end web interface written in PHP and HTML with MySQL as database system. a web-accessible potential drug target database (PDTD) was constructed for TarFisDock. the database currently contains more than 1100 protein entries with 3D structures. information on related diseases, biological functions and associated signaling pathways has also been collected. over 7000 pharmacophore models based on complex structures were generated. a sequential combination of triangle hashing and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization was adopted to identify the pharmacophore that best fit the task. the algorithm is highly automated and the interface is user friendly. a validation test docking known inhibitors into the binding pockets of TK and HIV-1 reverse RT indicated that GAsDock is more accurate than other docking programs. an improved adaptive genetic algorithm has been developed that supports a flexible docking method. a new iteration scheme was also employed to speed up the optimization and convergence processes, making this method significantly faster than the old method. a highly efficient conformational generation method has been developed. Cyndi is capable of searching the conformational space in nearly constant time. the conformers are encoded into GA individuals with information on the dihedral torsions. kinase-PMF was developed with a kinase data set of 872 complexes. this scoring function inherits the functional form and atom type of PMF0443. this method could allow researchers to screen and optimize hit compounds in kinase inhibitor development42. iteration method is to extract the 3D structural information and the binding affinity information in order to yield an \u201cenriched\u201d knowledge-based model. the IPMF score performs best in the activity prediction test. the IPMF approach provides a well-defined scheme to introduce binding information into typical statistical potentials. method named SHAFTS (SHApe-FeaTure Similarity) has been developed for rapid 3D molecular similarity calculation. it adopts hybrid similarity metrics of molecular shape and colored (or labeled) chemistry groups annotated by pharmacophore features for 3D calculation and ranking. SHAFTS achieved superior performance in terms of both overall and early stage enrichments of known actives and chemotypes. focused libraries are built on the basis of a lead compound or pharmacophore. targeted libraries are designed to seek drug leads against specific targets. drug-likeness and structural diversity have been introduced into library design. novel active compounds against four pharmacologically important targets were found using only the sequence of the target. this is the first example of a successful sequence-based drug design campaign. the current major tools for target identification are genomic and proteomic approaches, which are laborious and time-consuming17. a web-accessible potential drug target database (PDTD) was constructed for TarFisDock. the database currently contains more than 1100 protein entries with 3D structures. information on related diseases, biological functions and associated signaling pathways has also been collected. this database contains diverse information on more than 830 potential drug targets. the target protein structures in complex with small molecules were carefully extracted from the drugBank26, BindingDB27, PDBBind28, and PDTD24 databases. over 7000 pharmacophore models (covering information for over 1500 drug targets) were generated. a sequential combination of triHash and genetic algorithm optimization was adopted to identify the pharmacophore that best fit the task. GAsDock is more accurate than other docking programs, such as GOLD33, FlexX33, DOCK33, Surflex30, and Glide29. a new iteration scheme was also employed to speed up the optimization and convergence processes, making this method significantly faster than the old method. the conformation generation process is based on the multi-objective evolution algorithm (MOEA) the method is capable of searching the conformational space in nearly constant time. the conformers are encoded into GA individuals with information on the dihedral torsions of the rotatable bonds. kinase-PMF was developed with a kinase data set of 872 complexes from the PDB database. this scoring function inherits the functional form and atom type of PMF0443. this method could allow researchers to screen and optimize hit compounds in kinase inhibitor development42. the IPMF score was evaluated by scoring a diverse set of 219 protein-ligand complexes and comparing the results to seven commonly used scoring functions. the IPMF approach provides a well-defined scheme to introduce binding information into typical statistical potentials. a method named SHAFTS (SHApe-FeaTure Similarity) has been developed for rapid 3D molecular similarity calculation. this method adopts hybrid similarity metrics of molecular shape and colored (or labeled) chemistry groups annotated by pharmacophore features for 3D calculation and ranking. the triplet hashing method is used to enumerate fast molecular alignment poses. de novo drug design aims to chemically fill binding sites of target macromolecules. focused libraries are built on the basis of a lead compound or pharmacophore. targeted libraries are designed to seek drug leads against specific targets. this model was trained using 15 000 LPIs between 626 proteins and over 10 000 active compounds collected from the Binding Database52. nine novel active compounds against four pharmacologically important targets were found using only the sequence of the target. new computational drug discovery approaches have been successfully applied in several cases.
