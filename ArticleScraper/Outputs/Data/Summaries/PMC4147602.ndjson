{"summary": "in 2003, the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome in china brought to light weaknesses in the country's public health surveillance system. the response of the government2 included the creation of an extensive web-based, real-time, Infectious Disease Reporting System (IDRS), which enables all health facilities across the country to report information on the 37 notifiable diseases within 24 h. all TB-reporting facilities in china are required to report (i) confirmed TB cases seeking care via the TBIMS within 48 h and (ii) patients with presumptive TB to the IDRS, within 24 h. an interface between IDRS and TBIMS informs the TB units that a case within the same catchment area has been referred to that unit from the general hospital. every TB case for which treatment has been completed must be reconfirmed by the user. if the user wants to modify the entered information, they must ask the upper-level user for permission. china CDC held three training courses in 2005 to train about 400 staff from TB health facilities. they then trained those at county level through a cascade system. at present, there are about 20 000 users in the TB health facilities across the whole country using the TBIMS. the TBIMS was built on an Oracle framework and supported by a dictionary of variables and a moderated user forum. since 2011, the TBIMS has been structured in three case-based databases: one for all pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB cases, one for patients with presumptive drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), and one for confirmed DR-TB cases. a set of key variables are obligatory and logical check procedures are integrated into the TBIMS to ensure their completeness and accuracy. the system alerts the users with a popup window when there are quality control concerns about the entered data. for example, the date of onset should be earlier than the date of diagnosis. new tab Relationship between Tuberculosis Information Management System (TBIMS) and Infectious Disease Reporting System (IDRS) users can identify repeated records by searching the database using combination of case name, identification number, birth date and occupation. china CDC has held annual surveillance workshops to discuss how to solve existing issues about the TBIMS. the three databases making up the TBIMS are useful in tracking the trajectory of TB cases with presumptive or confirmed drug-resistant TB. the system also has the potential to follow individual TB patients who migrate within China during their care. all TB patients who have been treated over 2 months are required to have sputum smear results at the end of the 2nd month. patients whose sputum smear results did not become negative at the end of 2nd month should have sputum smear results at the end of the 3rd month. percentage of cases without a 2nd-month result entered decreased sharply between 2005 and 2011, reaching 3% in 2011. since 2005, the number of active TB cases entered into the TBIMS has averaged about one million annually. the paper-based surveillance system ran in parallel with the TBIMS from 2005 to 2008. the difference between TB cases captured by the paper system and TBMIS over total TB cases notified in the paper system decreased from 0.27% to 0.03% over the same period of time. notifications for new cases and relapses on the TBIMS represent about 90% of incident TB cases. the percentage of cases with the 2nd-month sputum result entered within 2 days of issue is also increasing. by 2011 about 25% of cases had a delay greater than 2 days. at present in china, only pulmonary TB is not a notifiable disease. extrapulmonary forms, even MDR-TB, are not notifiable. this means that unless a patient with presumptive or confirmed MDR-TB visits a TB dispensary and or designated TB hospital, that patient will not be captured by the surveillance system. achieving universal access to healthcare is the main motivation behind the ongoing health sector reforms in china."}
