{"summary": "mRNA translation is a paradigmatic illustration of this, as the hallmark of viruses is that their genomes do not code for a protein synthesis apparatus. understanding how viruses translate their own proteins may significantly contribute to the identification of therapeutic (Robert et al., 2006; Cencic et al., 2011) or breeding targets (Nicaise et al., 2003; Gao et al., 2004; Ruffel et al., 2005; Stein et al we describe other protein translation strategies used by plant viruses to optimize the usage of the coding capacity of their very compact genomes. most eukaryotic mRNAs are appended at the 5\u2032 end with a m7G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)N cap structure, and a poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032 end. translation is divided into four distinct steps: initiation, elongation, termination and ribosomal recycling. eIF4G interacts with eIF4E through its highly conserved canonical binding domain and forms. it is thought that the eIF4G-PABP interaction promotes the circularization of the message enhancing translation efficiency. however, there is increasing evidence that circularization may vary in importance for stimulation of translation among different organisms (i.e., yeast) and mammals. the 43S PIC searches for the mRNA start codon, scanning downstream of the leader sequence resulting in the entry of the 5\u2032 proximal start codon into the 40S subunit P-site. once the start codon enters the P-site, the 60S subunit joins, with the release of eIF2, eIF1 and eIF5. ribosomes remain bound to the mRNA and tRNA after the nascent polypeptide has been released. it is only during the ribosomal recycling phase when the ribosome subunit dissociation occurs leaving them free to bind new mRNAs. non-canonical translation initiation includes those that function independently of a 5\u2032 cap or/and a poly(A) tail. oopsb Yang et al., 1997 TuMV Potyviridae VPg/poly(A) Stem-loopb RPS6 Basso et al., 1994; Yang et al., 2009 TriMV Potyviridae VPg/poly(A) Two stem-loopsa eIF4G/eIFiso4G Roberts et al., 2015, 2017 BRV Secoviridae VP et al., 2004; Krab et al., 2005 3\u2032CITE STNV Tombusviridae 5\u2032pppN/-OH 3\u2032-UTR TED Long stem-loopa eIF4F/iso4F Meulewaeter et al., 1998; Gazo et al., 2004 PLPV Tombusviridae 5\u2032pppN/-OH TED Long stem-loopa Blanco-P TBTV Tombusviridae 5\u2032pppN/-OH BTE Basal helix plus 2 helicesa eIF4G Wang et al., 2004 TBSV Tombusviridae 5\u2032pppN/-OH YSS Three helicesa eIF4F/eIFiso4F Nicholson et al., 2013 PEMV2 Tombusviridae 5\u2032pppN/-OH PTE Pseu yviral genome acts as mRNA and codes for a single polyprotein. they are cleaved by viral proteases rendering 10 final functional proteins. the well-characterized VPg of Poliovirus (genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae) is only 22 amino acids (aa) long. the TEV CIRE-1 folds into an AU-rich pseudoknot structure (PK1, nucleotides 38\u201375) which is essential for cap-independent translation. mutations in the 7 nt-complementary sequence (61-UACUUU-67) were responsible for an approximately 80% decrease in translation compared to wild type. early experiments using partially eIF4F depleted wheat germ extract showed that the TEV 5\u2032-UTR conferred a competitive advantage over the 5\u2032 leaders of potato virus Y (PVY; genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae), turnip mosaic virus (TuMV, genus Potyvirus, family potyviridae) and Triticum mosaic virus (Triticum mosaic virus) have been shown to stimulate cap-independent translation. the 131-nt long 5\u2032 leader of TuMV conferred translational activity. the TBSV viral RNA is uncapped and not polyadenylated, having no VPg. the TBSV viral RNA is related to other ribosomal proteins implicated in picornaviral and alphaviral infection. the 5\u2032-UTRs of potyviruses are shorter than the IRESes of the Picornaviridae. potyviral 5\u2032-UTR resembles a true animal virus-like IRES. a hairpin structure at nucleotide positions 469-490 is required for cap-independent translation and internal translation initiation. the TriMV 5\u2032-UTR interacts with eIF4G or eIFiso4G in vitro. eIF4F-TEV RNA affinity in the presence of the VPg abolished stimulation of IRES-mediated translation in vitro. VPg binds the isoform of eIF4E, eIFiso4E in vitro and in vivo. it is unknown whether the VPg acts in cis when it is covalently attached to the 5\u2032 end. instead it primes picornaviral RNA synthesis. it is likely that the VPgs of all viruses also have this latter role. VPg-eIF4G interaction was mapped to the HEAT-1 domain in eIF4G and to the 20 C-terminal residues in VPgs. VPgs vary widely in sequence, even within a genus, so it would be difficult to extrapolate this structural information to potyvirus VPgs. the role in translation of secovirids VPgs is poorly understood. the CP IRES contains a bulged stem-loop structure that is flanked by two purine-rich repeats that are crucial for IRES activity. the CP IRES contains a bulged stem-loop structure that is flanked by two purine-rich repeats that are crucial for IRES activity. the authors reported that 16 consecutive GAAA repeats were sufficient to provide high IRES activity in plants and human cells. the 22 nt spacer sequence is sufficient to mediate cap-independent translation in vitro but not in vivo. this reported IRES function and the resulting translated ORF are not conserved in related poleroviruses. it may be possible that due to lack of structure, the RNA is sensitive to nuclease cleavage providing a 5\u2032 end. three basic types of 3\u2032 terminal TLS have been described in the genomes of Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV; genus Tymovirus, family Tymoviridae), TMV and Brome mosaic virus (BMV; genus Bromovirus, family Bromoviridae) translational enhancement maps principally to the TLS, although the upstream adjacent pseudoknot is important for optimal translation, possibly serving as a sequence spacer. the efficiency of initiation at the second AUG correlated with its proximity to the first AUG. the translation efficiency of the polyprotein ORF depended on a 5\u2032 cap, and not the 3\u2032 TLS. this suggests how the TLS interacts with the 5\u2032 end to stimulate translation. the 3\u2032-UTR of the TYMV TLS is structurally similar to the TYMV TLS and functions as minus-strand promoter. however, the 3\u2032-UTR of TMV RNA does not mediate translation enhancement. eIFiso4G2 exhibits more functional similarity with eIF4G than eIFiso4G. the 3\u2032-UTR of AMV also plays a role in translation due to its ability to bind the CP, adopting the CP-binding conformation. this binding avoids the minus-strand promoter activity and enhances translation, possibly acting as a mimic of the poly(A) tail. a minus-strand promoter and pseudoknot stability may regulate a conformational switch between translation and replication. most 3\u2032-CITEs have in common their ability to bind translation initiation factors of the eIF4E or eIF4G families. they recruit translation initiation factors leading to ribosome entry at or near the 5\u2032 terminus followed by ribosome scanning to the initiation codon. the TED is predicted to form a long stem-loop with several internal bulges. this element was shown to be functional in enhancing translation in vitro and in vivo. the STNV 3\u2032-CITE confers cap-independent translation in vitro. MNeSV ISS has been shown to preferentially interact with the eIF4E subunit of eIF4F. base pairing between the 3\u2032-UTR and the 5\u2032-UTR is predicted to deliver the translation factor to the 5\u2032 end. ribosome toe printing demonstrated that while bound to eIF4E, the I-shaped CITE can simultaneously base pair with the 5\u2032-UTR and recruit ribosomes to the 5\u2032 end of the viral fragment mutational analyses in eIF4E residues involved in its interaction with eIF4G showed that eIF4F complex formation is necessary for efficient cap-independent translation driven by Ma5TE. the 3\u2032-UTR of this MNSV isolate harbors two 3\u2032-CITEs, Ma5TE, and CXTE, with CXTE secondary RNA structure folding into two helices protruding from a central hub. the eIF4G-binding site in the BTE was revealed by SHAPE footprinting. eIF4G protects SL-I and nearby bases around base of the hub from which all helices protrude. addition of eIF4E enhanced the level of protection and stimulated translation by about 25%. eIF4A helicase, eIF4B plus ATP bind in order to recruit the 40S subunit directly to the BTE. the long-distance base pairing would then deliver the 40S complex to the 5\u2032 end for scanning to the first AUG. this differs from a previous model in which it was proposed that the long-distance base pairing places the factors near the 5\u2032 end. eIF4A/eIF4G/ATP altering BTE structure may be a consequence of helicase activity of eIF4A/eIF4G/ATP altering BTE structure. eIF4E enhances but is not required for BTE binding. eIF4 complex is delivered to 5\u2032 end by long-distance base pairing. it recruits the 43S preinitiation complex to the RNA. other factors, such as eIF3 and factors in the preinitiation complex. the PEMV2 PTE consists of a three-way branched helix with a large G-rich bulge in the main stem. the formation of a magnesium-dependent pseudoknot between the G-rich bulge and a C-rich sequence at the three-helix junction of the PTE is critical for translation and eIF4E recruitment. the TSS resembles a three-dimensional tRNA-like structure (Zuo et al., 2010). the TCV TSS recruits and binds the 60S subunit of the 80S ribosome (Stupina et al., 2008). two additional TSSs were found in the PEMV2 3\u2032-UTR. the 3\u2032 UTRs of several members of the Tombusviridae contain no structure that obviously resembles a known 3\u2032-CITE. nepovirus genomes contain a VPg linked to their 5\u2032 end, thus are uncapped but polyadenylated requiring also cap-independent translation mechanisms. the BRV IRESes contain little secondary structure, harboring only one predicted single stem-loop structure at the 5\u2032 end. IRESes, CITE activity was mapped to the 3\u2032-UTRs of BRV RNA1 and RNA2. this activity depended on the presence of a predicted stem-loop structure located immediately downstream of the last ORF. secondary structures of the 3\u2032-CITE and 5\u2032-UTR have not been determined. VPgs in different virus families differ greatly in size and function. the well-characterized VPg of Poliovirus (genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae) is only 22 amino acids (aa) long. that of potyviruses consists of around 192 aa. mutations in the 7 nt-complementary sequence (61-UACUUCU-67) were responsible for an approximately 80% decrease in translation compared to wild type. this type of complementarity also occurs between the 18S rRNA and the sequence 4836-GAUCCU-4841 that belongs to the translation enhancer located in the 3\u2032-UTR of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV; genus Luteovirus, family Luteoviridae) the 5\u2032 leaders of potato virus Y (PVY; genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae), turnip mosaic virus (TuMV, genus Potyvirus, family potyviridae) have been shown to stimulate cap-independent translation. the 5\u2032-UTR of PVY also contains an IRES that directs efficient translation of an ORF in a dicistronic vector. the TBSV viral RNA is uncapped and not polyadenylated, having no VPg. it is related to other ribosomal proteins implicated in picornaviral and alphaviral infection. the 5\u2032-UTRs of potyviruses are much shorter than the IRESes of the Picornaviridae. the exceptionally long (739 nt) 5\u2032-UTR is much longer than that of other potyvirids. the minimal region of the TriMV leader for cap-independent translation resides in a 300-nt long sequence forming a secondary structure. a hairpin structure at nucleotide positions 469-490 is required for cap-independent translation and internal translation initiation. IF4E binding abolished stimulation of IRES-mediated translation in vitro. VPg binds the isoform of eIF4E, eIFiso4E in vitro and in vivo. PABP increases binding affinity and stabilization of VPg with eIF4F. picornaviral RNA lacks the VPg (Nomoto et al., 1977) it primes picornavirus RNA synthesis (Paul et al., 1998). the potyvirus VPg may functionally resemble the 13\u201315 kDa VPg of calici- and noroviruses (Caliciviridae) VPgs vary widely in sequence, even within a genus. it would be difficult to extrapolate this structural information to potyvirus VPgs. it would be valuable to determine whether translating potyvirus RNA on polysomes contains a VPg. authors reported that 16 consecutive GAAA repeats were sufficient to provide high IRES activity in plants and human cells. a low level of CP translation from genomic RNA of carmoviruses has been reported to be IRES-mediated. tRNA-like structures Viruses from the family Bromoviridae and the genera Tobamovirus and Tymovirus possess a 5\u2032 cap structure but lack a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. tRNA-like structures (TLSs) at their 3\u2032 termini perform many viral processes, such as (i) serving as a telomere by interacting with CTP:ATP nucleotidyl transferase which adds CCA in translational enhancement structures and mechanisms have been well characterized for TMV and TYMV. the TYMV TLS requires aminoacylation of the 3\u2032-CCA terminus for maximum translational efficiency. the 5\u2032 cap synergistically promotes this activity. the TYMV TLS has a tRNA-like shape, but uses a very different set of intramolecular interactions. a pseudoknot mimics the structure of a tRNA basepaired to a codon in mRNA, facilitating instant elongation as the ribosome joins the viral RNA with no initiation steps. the 3\u2032-UTR of TMV contains an upstream pseudoknot domain that stimulates translation in a way that is replaceable by a poly(A) tail. eIFiso4G2 isoform also contributes in -mediated translation, unlike eIFiso4G which did not affect -dependent translation. CP-bound RNA folds into a series of stem-loops separated by an AUGC motif. mutations in this motif led to the loss of binding to CP. CP interacts with eIF4G/eIFiso4G subunits. most 3\u2032-CITEs have in common their ability to bind translation initiation factors of the eIF4E or eIF4G families. the presence of small sequence stretches within or near the 3\u2032-CITE capable of base-pairing to sequences in the 5\u2032-UTR of the mRNA to establish long-distance RNA:RNA interactions. by definition, 3\u2032-CITEs functionally substitute for the 5\u2032 cap with high efficiency. TED binds eIF4F or eIFiso4F to the 5\u2032-UTR via a predicted RNA:RNA long-distance interaction with the apical loop of the 5\u2032 end. mutations that disrupted this potential long-distance base-pairing reduced translation only slightly. eIF4E interacts with the eIF4E subunit of eIF4F. base pairing between the 3\u2032-CITE and the 5\u2032-UTR is predicted to deliver the translation factor to the 5\u2032 end. mutations in eIF4E residues involved in its interaction with eIF4G showed that eIF4F complex formation is necessary for efficient cap-independent translation driven by Ma5TE. a new resistant-breaking isolate of MNSV revealed a new class of 3\u2032-CITE, the CXTE, which was acquired from cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV, genus Polerovirus, family Luteoviridae) Xinjiang by interfamilial recombination. the 3\u2032-UTR of this MNSV isolate harbors two 3\u2032-CITEs, Ma5TE, and CX eIF4G protects SL-I and nearby bases around base of the hub. addition of eIF4E enhanced the level of protection and stimulated translation by about 25%. only the core domain (including eIF4A and eIF3 binding sites) and an adjacent upstream RNA binding domain are necessary for binding to the BTE and to stimulate translation. eIF4F helicase, eIF4B plus ATP bind in order to recruit the 40S subunit directly to the BTE. the long-distance base pairing would then deliver the 40S complex to the 5\u2032 end for scanning to the first AUG. this differs from a previous model in which it was proposed that the long-distance base pairing places the factors near the 5\u2032 end. eIF4 complex is delivered to 5\u2032 end by long-distance base pairing. eIF4 complex is delivered to 5\u2032 end by long-distance base pairing. eIF4 complex is delivered to 5\u2032 end by long-distance base pairing. TBSV, genus Tombusvirus, family Tombusviridae, contain 3\u2032-CITEs resembling Y-shaped structure (YSS), formed by three helical regions. alterations in junction residues between helices and in a large asymmetric bulge disrupted translation. TBSV YSS was detectable only in in vivo. the PEMV2 PTE consists of a three-way branched helix with a large G-rich bulge in the main stem. the formation of a magnesium-dependent pseudoknot between the G-rich bulge and a C-rich sequence at the three-helix junction of the PTE is critical for translation and eIF4E recruitment. the TSS recruits and binds the 60S subunit of the 80S ribosome. no base pairing between 3\u2032-CITE and 5\u2032-UTR has been identified. two additional TSSs were found in the PEMV2 3\u2032-UTR. tRNA-like structures Viruses from the family Bromoviridae and the genera Tobamovirus and Tymovirus possess a 5\u2032 cap structure but lack a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. tRNA-like structures (TLSs) at their 3\u2032 termini perform many viral processes, such as (i) serving as a telomere by interacting with CTP:ATP nucleotidyl transferase which adds CCA in the aminoacylated TLS binds to eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) and is a substrate for tRNA-modifying enzymes. the 5\u2032-proximal AUG in the TYMV genome serves as start codon for a 69 kDa ORF (p69) the second AUG is the start codon for the main polyprotein ORF (p206) with which ORF p69 overlaps. the ribosome is delivered to the 5\u2032-UTR by communication with the 5\u2032 end through the cap-eIF4E-eIF4G-eIF3-40S chain of interactions. a pseudoknot mimics the structure of a tRNA basepaired to a codon in mRNA, facilitating instant elongation as the ribosome joins the viral RNA with no initiation steps. eIFiso4G2 interacts with eIF4F via eIF4G. eIFiso4G2 exhibits more functional similarity with eIF4G than eIFiso4G. eIFiso4G2 isoform also contributes in -mediated translation. the presence of the CP promotes the base pairing between linker motifs. the presence of the CP promotes the base pairing between linker motifs. this interaction may stimulate mRNA circularization in a similar fashion as found for rotaviruses. 3\u2032-CITEs functionally substitute for the 5\u2032 cap with high efficiency. they recruit translation initiation factors leading to ribosome entry at or near the 5\u2032 terminus followed by ribosome scanning to the initiation codon. however, in contrast to IRESes, 3\u2032-CITEs do not promote internal ribosome entry. the STNV 3\u2032-CITE confers cap-independent translation in vitro when it is moved to the 5\u2032-UTR of an uncapped reporter. another member of the Tombusviridae family, Pelargonium line pattern virus (PLPV, genus Carmovirus) was recently shown to harbor a 3\u2032-CITE in the TED class. in vitro binding assays revealed that ma5TE forms a complex with eIF4F. this interaction was mapped to a conserved guanosine residue located in a Ma5TE internal loop. mutational analyses in eIF4E residues involved in its interaction with eIF4G showed that eIF4F complex formation is necessary for efficient cap-independent translation driven by Ma5TE. the 3\u2032-UTR of this MNSV isolate harbors two 3\u2032-CITEs. both 3\u2032-CITEs are active in susceptible melon. only the CXTE functions in resistant melon and in the absence of eIF4E. non-canonical translation mechanisms are used by plant RNA viruses. non-canonical translation elements are grouped depending on their location in viral genome. lighter-shaded loops in the secondary structure of 3\u2032-CITEs indicated sequences known or predicted to base-pair to the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome. a long-distance kissing stem-loop interaction between a loop in the BTE and the 5\u2032-UTR is required for BTE-mediated translation the dependence on helicase activity may support an older model in which a six base tract in the 17 nt conserved sequence (GAUCCU) base pairs directly to 18S rRNA at the position where the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is located in prokaryotic ribosomal RNA. this base pairing would recruit the 40S subunit directly to the BTE. eIF4F binds to SL-I of the BTE (green) through the eIF4G subunit. eIF4E enhances but is not required for BTE binding. eIF4E binds and uses ATP hydrolysis to unwind GAUCCU. alterations in junction residues between helices and in a large asymmetric bulge disrupted translation. the YSS of carnation italian ringspot virus (CIRV, genus Dianthovirus, family Tombusviridae) requires addition of the eIF4F complex to a factor-depleted wheat germ extract to promote efficient translation. MV2 PTE may not participate in a long-distance RNA:RNA interaction with a 5\u2032 proximal hairpin located in the p33 ORF. most other PTEs contain a loop predicted to base pair to the 5\u2032-UTR. two additional TSSs were found in the PEMV2 3\u2032-UTR. the 40S subunit binds the 5\u2032-UTR and the 60S subunit binds the TSS. mutations that disrupted the downstream TSS had no effect in translation. two genomic RNAs (gRNA) of BRV have translation enhancing sequences in their 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs. the gRNAs contain IRES elements that facilitate translation when placed at the 5\u2032-end of a non-capped reporter RNA or internally between two reporter genes. the BRV IRESes contain little secondary structure, harboring only one predicted single stem-loop structure at the 5\u2032 end. many of the key elements identified in BRV RNAs are predicted to be conserved in the RNAs of other nepoviruses. many of the key elements identified in BRV RNAs, including 5\u2032\u20133\u2032-UTR RNA interactions and sequence complementarity with the 18S rRNA in the 5\u2032-UTR, are predicted to be conserved. the TGB3 of potato virus X (PVX, family Flexiviridae, genus Potexvirus) and the TGB2 of Peanut clump virus (PCV, family Virgaviridae, genus Hordeivirus) are expressed by leaky scanning. leaky scanning may also be facilitated by the use of non-AUG initiation codons. a portion of ribosomes fail to terminate at a stop codon and continue translation until they reach an alternative start codon in the optimal initiation context. this process allows the expression of two proteins with distinct amino acid sequence when the initiation sites are in different reading frames or C-terminally coincident isoforms of a single protein. the efficiency of readthrough can be stimulated by the presence of elements downstream of the stop codon: UAG stop codon followed by the consensus motif CARYYA a small ORF in the sobemoviruses, ORFx, was discovered that overlaps ORF2a and is essential for Turnip rosette virus (TRoV, genus Sobemovirus) to establish systemic infection. the second AUG initiates an ORF encoding a 69 kDa protein that overlaps with the main replicase-encoding ORF initiated by the second. plant viruses use programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRS) to translate overlapping ORFs. this recoding event can occur in the + or direction relative to the normal 0 frame of mRNA translation by shifting the ribosome in one or two nucleotides forward or backward. the efficiency of frameshifting in viruses varies from 1% in BYDV to 82% in cardioviruses. in plant viruses these structural elements fall into three structural classes. the -1 PRS stimulatory elements of BYDV, PEMV-RNA2 and RCNMV fold into a stem-loop with an internal bulge. this interaction is required for the low expression levels of RdRp and thus replication. the frameshift regulatory element of BWYV was the first to be determined at atomic resolution showing a compact pseudoknot with a triple-stranded region. it was suggested that pseudoknots provide a kinetic barrier to the ribosome and that the unfolding of this element correlate with frameshifting stimulation. type II motif is used by tobraviruses, pecluviruses, furoviruses and pomoviruses to generate their viral RdRp. it involves a UAG stop codon followed by a CGG or CUA triplet and a stem-loop structure about 8 nts downstream of the stop codon. the type III class comprises an UAG stop codon, a downstream G or purine-rich octanucleotide readthrough of the CP stop codon of viruses from the Luteoviridae family appears to use a fourth class of cis-acting signals. readthrough requires a tract of 8\u201316 repeats of CCXXXXX beginning about 8 nt downstream of stop codon. the TGB3 of potato virus X (PVX, family Flexiviridae, genus Potexvirus) and the TGB2 of Peanut clump virus (PCV, family Virgaviridae, genus Pecluvirus) are expressed by leaky scanning. leaky scanning may also be facilitated by the use of non-AUG initiation codons, which require a strong initiation context. top panel represents leaky scanning mechanism where ribosomes fail to start translation at the first AUG codon and continue scanning until they reach an alternative start codon in the optimal initiation context. this process allows the expression of two proteins with distinct amino acid sequence when the initiation sites are in-frame. the efficiency of readthrough can be stimulated by the presence of elements downstream of the stop codon. the second ORF, which encodes the coat protein, starts with AUG in a poor context. the third ORF, a movement protein gene, starts with AUG in a strong context. the secondary structure encompassing these two AUGs also affects initiation preference. plant viruses use programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRS) to translate overlapping ORFs. this recoding event can occur relative to the normal 0 frame of mRNA translation by shifting the ribosome in one or two nucleotides forward or backward. the efficiency of frameshifting in viruses varies from 1% in BYDV to 82% in cardioviruses. in plant viruses these structural elements, acting as stimulators of frameshifting, fall into three structural classes. the -1 PRS stimulatory elements of BYDV, PEMV-RNA2 and RCNMV fold into a stem-loop with an internal bulge. this interaction is required for the low expression levels of RdRp and thus replication. e yellow leaf virus (BWYV, PLRV, and ScYLV, family Luteoviridae, genus Polerovirus) form h-type pseudoknots. the frameshift regulatory element of BWYV was the first to be determined at atomic resolution showing a compact pseudoknot with a triple-stranded region. type II motif is used by tobraviruses, pecluviruses, furoviruses and pomoviruses to generate their viral RdRp. it involves a UAG stop codon followed by a CGG or CUA triplet and a stem-loop structure about 8 nts downstream of the stop codon. the type III class comprises an UAG stop codon, a downstream G or purine-rich octanucleotide readthrough of the CP stop codon of viruses from the Luteoviridae family appears to use a fourth class of cis-acting signals. readthrough requires a tract of 8\u201316 repeats of CCXXXXX beginning about 8 nt downstream of stop codon. resulting CP-readthrough protein fusion is not essential for virus particle assembly. members of the non-related family Closteroviridae are predicted to use a +1 frameshift to synthesize their viral replicases. the -1 PRS usually requires two signals in the mRNA, a slippery sequence of the type X_XXY_YYZ, where X represents any nucleotide, Y represents A or U and Z represents A, C or U. this element participates in a long-distance interaction with the apical loop of a stem-loop located in the 3\u2032-UTR. this interaction is required for the low expression levels of RdRp and thus replication. similar long-range base pairing interactions were shown in RNAs of RCNMV and PEMV2. stop-codon readthrough is a common strategy found in plant viruses to encode protein variants with an extended C-terminus from the same RNA. some ribosomes do not stop at the stop codon but continue until the next termination codon. tobacco necrosis virus-D (TNV-D, genus Betanecrovirus, family Tombusviridae) employs a complex series of downstream interactions. a bulged readthrough stem-loop (RTSL) located 3 kb downstream in the structure required for replication initiation. readthrough of the CP stop codon of viruses from the Luteoviridae family appears to use a fourth class of cis-acting signals. 16 repeats of CCXXXXX beginning about 8 nt downstream of stop codon. the resulting CP-readthrough protein fusion is not essential for virus particle assembly or infectivity it is assembled into the virion. it is required for persistent, circulative aphid transmission. it would be highly desirable to obtain additional and deeper information on specific cases and mechanisms. mutations in viral factors conferring compatibility with translation initiation factors of otherwise non-host plants can contribute to broaden the host range of potyviruses. the diversity of mechanisms is particularly striking when identified in a single viral RNA. wheat is hexaploid and difficult to transform because it is hexaploid and difficult to transform. in this regard, the preparation of translationally active extracts from evacuolated protoplasts from different plant species may contribute to solve this problem. the diversity of translation mechanisms points toward the different ways that viruses use and control the basic translation machinery of the cell. large screenings of the human genome revealed widespread identification of cap-independent translation elements located in the 5\u2032-UTR and 3\u2032-UTR of human transcripts. in plants, there are few reports on ribosome profiling under abiotic stresses such as drought, varying external light conditions or in response to reactive oxygen species. absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
