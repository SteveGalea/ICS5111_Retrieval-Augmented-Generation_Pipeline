{"summary": "the affected colony consists of wild-caught big brown bats (E. fuscus) from north Carolina and their offspring. the bats are used in studies of echolocation and vocalization. all procedures are approved by the University of Washington IACUC. previous health problems in the colony include ectoparasites and seasonal infectious and noninfectious distal limb arthropathy (joint swelling) the colony breeds successfully, and approximately 50% of the female bats give birth in the spring. an animal caretaker found a single dead bat in the outdoor enclosure. construction on the building roof where the bats were housed had begun 2 d earlier, resulting in considerable noise at night. to address the concerns that the environmental perturbations were the cause of reduced food consumption, the colony was moved to a new, noise-reduced holding area inside the building. two of the recently deceased animals and the moribund bat were euthanized and necropsied; necropsy revealed severe, diffuse hepatic lipidosis. the colony had been housed for 3 wk in the indoor facility. 6 additional bats were found dead in the cage; the 4 sent to necropsy were found to have hepatic lipidosis. the bats were moved to a temporary outdoor enclosure in a different building in November 2004. after this move, 6 animals died; gross examination of 3 bats was again consistent with hepatic lipidosis. hepatic lipidosis was diagnosed in all 5 pregnant bats sent to necropsy. 21 juvenile bats died during this same time period. in 2011, 2 isolated deaths due to hepatic lipidosis. 2 isolated deaths due to hepatic lipidosis were noted in 2013. from 2006 to 2013, the colony mortality was analyzed by month. the months of November and December had the lowest mortalities. body condition was noted as poor, with decreased internal and subcutaneous fat deposits, for 4 of the 5 pregnant female and male bats with a necropsy diagnosis of hepatic lipidosis. externally, some bats were icteric and had regionally extensive petechiation and ecchymoses on the webbing and skin. there is severe, diffuse cytoplasmic distention of hepatocytes by large, round, clear vacuoles that displace the nucleus. bar, 500 m. (D) Hepatic lipidosis; higher magnification image of panel C. the pathogenesis of hepatic lipidosis is complex and multifactorial. hepatic lipidosis occurs when the rate of triglyceride accumulation in the liver overwhelms the triglyceride degradation capacity. hepatic lipidosis (with concurrent renal and cardiac lipidosis) in 3 captive greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) occurred 5 to 6 mo after capture, and the etiology was presumed to be due to stress and mobilization of fat stores. a national mealworm shortage in our colony resulted in several deaths in bats that did not adapt well to an alternative diet. insectivorous bats eat a variety of insects which differ in their nutritional content. in captivity, insects are often fed a diet of fortified mealworms. captive bats may be underweight compared with wild bats. hepatic lipidosis occurs when free fatty acids are released from body fat stores and esterified into fatty acyl CoA in the liver during times of stress. female insectivorous bats rely more on carbohydrate metabolism than male counterparts and are more efficient at storing energy. fatal-fasting-like syndrome in other mammalian species, including monkeys and cats, appears to respond in a similar manner. the colony was treated by providing simple nutritional supplements, isolation and handfeeding of ill animals, and removal or avoidance of environmental stressors."}
