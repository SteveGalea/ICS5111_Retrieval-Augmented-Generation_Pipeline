{"summary": "immunogenicity of HIV-1 vaccines containing either gp120 protein alone or in combinations of four or fourteen different gp120s in immunized hamsters. polyvalent vaccine showed higher antibody titers to HIV-1 subtypes MN and SF162 compared to the groups that received one or four gp120 proteins. however, the polyvalent vaccine was not able to show higher neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 primary isolates. gp120 contains variable loops (V1-V5) which likely hide critical conserved epitope sites favoured by the Nabs. genetic variability in HIV-gp120 between groups M, N and O also affect the induction of Nabs [6,7]. this complicate the design of an effective candidate vaccine against HIV. fourteen wild type gp120 subtypes B were amplified, cloned and the recombinant gp120 proteins were expressed in mammalian cell lines. golden hamsters were immunized with equivalent amounts of 1 vs. 4 vs. 14 distinct gp120 proteins and humoral (antibody binding and neutralization) responses to HIV-1 subtypes B, C and A/E were analyzed. most of the HIV-1 gp120 sequences were clustered from the HIV-1 subtype B isolate MN. this isolate was epidemiologically linked to the subtype A/E isolate 93TH975. each gp120 variant was cloned into the pEF6-myc-His vector. Western blot analysis of recombinant HIV-1 gp120 proteins. lanes 2\u20138 are the first seven gp120 proteins purified from transfected CHO cells. hamsters were immunized four times S.C. in three different sites. the polyvalent candidate vaccine induces higher antibody titers against HIV-1 subtype B than other subtypes. plasma from immunized hamsters was collected two weeks after each immunization and analyzed by ELISA. anti-gp120 titers were determined in hamsters two weeks after the last immunization. hamster sera were serially diluted in wells and absorbance was read at 490 nm with an ELISA plate reader. a high proliferative immune response was observed to the gp120 protein isolated from patient #001 in all groups with the exception of the control group. splenocytes from immunized hamsters were further stimulated with HIV-1 gp120 strains and subtypes that were not included in the vaccine components. 6A: HIV-1 gp120 subtype B (MN strain), 6B: HIV-1 gp120 subtype C (96ZM651 strain), 6C: HIV-1 gp120 subtype C (93TH975 strain), 6D: HIV-1 gp120 subtype A/E (93TH975 strain), 6D: HIV-1 gp120 subtype A/E (93TH975 strain) most of the HIV-1 gp120 sequences were clustered from the HIV-1 subtype B isolate MN. this isolate was epidemiologically linked to the subtype A/E isolate 93TH975. each gp120 variant was cloned into the pEF6-myc-His vector. Western blot analysis of recombinant HIV-1 gp120 proteins. lanes 2\u20138 are the first seven gp120 proteins (#1\u20137) purified from transfected CHO cells. the polyvalent candidate vaccine induces higher antibody titers against HIV-1 subtype B than other subtypes. plasma from immunized hamsters was collected two weeks after each immunization and analyzed by ELISA. the plates were coated with HIV-1 gp120 subtypes B (MN and SF162), C (96ZM651), and A/E (93TH975) overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by incubation with serially diluted plasma hamster sera were serially diluted in wells and absorbance was read at 490 nm with an ELISA plate reader. results show that the polyvalent vaccine induces a higher antibody response to subtype B than the single gp120 candidate vaccine. the neutralization antibody responses were compared with SVA-MLV (Murine retrovirus Env-pseudovirus) as a background control for non-specific activity. the polyvalent gp120 vaccine induced higher T cell proliferation in immunized hamsters. two days later, 3H-thymidine was added and after 18 h the incorporated radioactivity was measured in harvested splenocytes. antigenic variation of HIV-1 gp120 is a major obstacle for the development of an effective vaccine [16-18] ten HIV-1 strains that had a non-syncytium-inducing phenotype and four that had a syncytium-inducing phenotype were selected from a bank of clinical isolates. the multivalent approach to increase the immune response against heterologous strains within a subtype could provide enhanced vaccine protection within a geographic region. the production of gp120 proteins was increased more than 20-fold in the stable cell lines, allowing for efficient protein purification. it is possible that a cocktail of gp120 proteins containing multiple epitopes will maximize the breadth of immune response against HIV-1 compared to a single immunogen. antibodies to hamster CD3 and CD8 were not studied due to non-existent labelled antibodies to hamster CD3 and CD8. group D, which received all fourteen proteins, showed higher mean IgG antibody titer to HIV-1 subtype B isolates MN and SF162 in comparison to groups B and C. a polyvalent HIV-1 envelope protein approach is not able to neutralize antibodies against HIV-1. however, a polyvalent HIV-1 envelope protein approach in the context of DNA priming followed by protein boosting may be able to neutralize some of HIV-1 strains from different subtypes. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C containing 5% CO2 and 20 IU/ml Interleukin-2 (IL-2: R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) 2 106 freshly stimulated donor cells were added every 10 days to sustain HIV replication. total RNA was purified using RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON) recombinant proteins can be purified by affinity chromatography using c-myc epitope or poly histidine (6 His) metal-binding tags. expression constructs confirmed and characterized by restriction enzymes and nucleotide sequence analysis. groups of four hamsters were immunized four times subcutaneously (S.C.) four days after the last boost, the hamsters were sacrificed and their spleens were collected for further testing or long-term storage in cryopreservation medium. TZM-bl cells were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. 200 TCID50 of virus was incubated in a total volume of 150 l for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C in 96-well flat-bottom culture plates. a 100 l aliquot containing 2 105 cells was added to each well in triplicate. cells were also stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin (PMA/ION: Sigma) after 48 h of culture, 1 Ci [3H] thymidine was added to each well. amplification and cloning of HIV-1 gp120 genes into pEF6-myc-His vectors. the amplicons were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit. the amplicons were cloned into the pEF6-myc-His vectors. CHO culture CHO cells were grown at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in IMDM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS (Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml gentamicin. recombinant viral proteins were purified with the TALON metal resin kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as per manufacturer's instructions. clade B (MN, SF162), C (96ZM651) and A/E (93TH975) were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. the plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. after a second wash with PBS/0.05% Tween 20, the plates were incubated for 2 h with serially diluted sera. one set of control wells received cells + virus (virus control) and another set received cells only (background control) an assay stock of HIV-1 MN was prepared in H9 cells. all virus stocks were made cell-free by 0.45-micron filtration. AA performed and analyzed majority of the experiments, participated in the design and wrote the manuscript. DEA participated in analyzing the data. MG helped in the cloning."}
