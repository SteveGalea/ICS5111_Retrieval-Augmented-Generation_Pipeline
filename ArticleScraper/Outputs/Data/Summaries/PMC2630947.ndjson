{"summary": "polar bear (Thalarctos maritimus), american black bear (Ursus americanus), Asiatic black bear (Selenarctos thibetanus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), and sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) all of these species are endangered \u2013 five are listed in convention on international trade in endangered species of wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) bear bile is the dried gallbladder with bile of selenarctos thibetanus curvier or Ursus arctos L. the dried gallbladder with bile from other species of Ursidae can be used as Bear bile. bear bile can be dissolved in milk or succus from Bambusae (Zhulishui in Chinese) for heat-toxin syndrome manifest by skin carbuncle, sore throat and hemorrhoids, it is prepared to be a water solution as eyewash or used together with Borneolum (Bingpian in Chinese) ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and cholic acid (CA) were found to be the primary bile acid produced in the liver of bears. bile made it different from those originated from pandas, related carnivores and other vertebrates. choleretic lithagogic effect, (4) anti-liver fibrosis, anti-tumor, anti-pyretic and sedative effect, (5) anti-convulsant and analgesic effect, (5) lowering lipid and hypotensive effect, (7) anti-tussive and anti-asthmatic effect, (8) improving eyesight, (7) anti-stress and relaxing effect [22,31]. bear bile is widely used for hepatic and biliary disorders. the pure compound derived from bear bile, UDCA, is widely used for hepatic and biliary disorders. it could also be applied to diabetes, nephritis, chincough, hemorrhoids, chronic hepatitis B induced jaundice. bears suffering extreme pain due to daily bile extractions. many of them often die from illnesses such as cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, polyp formation, obstruction of the cystic duct, strictures and partial herniation of the gall bladder wall, liver cancer. bile products were on sale in traditional medicine shops in the u.s., canada, china, china, china and new zealand. bile products originated from domestic pigs, goats, and water buffalo. only minority of the specimens was found from bears. the long-term goal was to end bear farming and provide care and refuge for the remaining number of bears. efforts were given in supporting the research about the manufacture and the use of herbal and synthetic substitutes to bear bile. the use of bear bile was a problem of history, culture and economy. the use of bear bile was a problem of history, culture and economy. there were 123 Chinese medicine products made of bear bile and 183 enterprises supported by bear bile powder. some research has been done on alternative for bear bile from three aspects. it would not be able to stop using bear bile immediately even an alternative was available. bile acid compositions of several fowls and domestic animals were preliminarily studied. bile acids were the main effective components, which consisted of UDCA and CDCA. bears were the only mammals to produce significant amounts of UDCA. UDCA was also found in other animal species and could be extracted from pig bile and cow bile. herbal medicines were found to have the efficacies of clearing heat and detoxification, purifying liver and improving eyesight. one or more of these herbal medicines could be used as an alternative for bear bile [10,54,55] Chinese medicines under the category of plant with the efficacy of clearing heat included: Gentianae scabrae, Radix; Aloes, Herba; Paridis, Rhizoma; and Violae yedoensitis, Herba cum Radice. bear bile had the efficacy of clearing heat and detoxification. eclampsia, epilepsy, tic, hot liver, red eyes and swollen problem could not be used to treat visual disturbance caused by weak liver and kidney. scientists in pharmacology of Chinese medicine and Chinese Materia Medica were required to work closely in order to find an alternative for bear bile. they were required to carry out detailed research and to propose scientific research methodology. Coptis for medical utilization, Coptis chinensis Franch, Coptis deltoidea C.Y. Cheng et Hsiao and Coptis teeta wall can be found in Mainland China. studies in our group have established, using HPLC-MS/MS, the chemical profile of Coptis and have made comparison on the chemical composition amongst species. berberine, coptisine, palmatine, jatrorrhizine and magnoflorine are used as a criterion for quality control of the herbs. however, single criterion has its limitation in quality control system. previous studies showed that Coptis and berberine showed promising potential as drug candidates for the treatment of liver injury [[72] and unpublished data]. positive data add new pharmacological activities for coptis and bear bile and indicate potential of coptis and berberine as an alternative to bear bile. bear bile can be dissolved in milk or succus from Bambusae. for heat-toxin syndrome manifest by skin carbuncle, sore throat and hemorrhoids, it is prepared to be a water solution as eyewash or used together with Borneolum (Bingpian in Chinese) bear bile was considered as a cold medicine, bitter in flavor, cool in nature and attributive to liver, gallbladder and heart. it could clear heat to relieve toxin, stop endogenous wind to arrest convulsion and clear away liver fire to improve eyesight. it was also used in the cure of carbuncle of heat type, pyocutaneous diseases, hemorrhoid, overabundance of liver-fire. the fine powder can be applied to the local area or used with water. it is contraindicated for deficiency and cold of the spleen and stomach. bile was regarded as the principle components of bear bile in medical applications. bile originated from farmed bears (bears with chronic biliary fistulae) bile was characterized by a decrease in the percent composition of tauro-cholic acid (TCA) and a dramatic increase in that of tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) bear bile powder could prevent liver fibrosis induced by DMN. the mechanism might relate to its inhibitory effect on the activation of Kupffer cell (KC) and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) bile was mainly composed of bile acids, amino acids, bile pigments, fat and a few phospholipids and trace metals. ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and cholic acid (CA) was found to be the primary bile acid produced in the liver of bears. bear bile has the following pharmacological actions: (1) antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effect, (2) anti-hepatotoxic effect, (3) choleretic lithagogic effect, (3) anti-liver fibrosis, anti-tumor, anti-pyretic and sedative effect, (5) anti-convulsant and analgesic effect, (5) lowering lipid and hypotensive effect, (7) anti-tussive and anti-asthmatic effect, bear bile has a wide range of pharmacological actions with little toxicological side effect. the pure compound derived from bear bile, UDCA, is widely used for hepatic and biliary disorders. the pure compound derived from bear bile, UDCA, is widely used for hepatic and biliary disorders. bears were suffering extreme pain due to daily bile extractions. many of them often die from illnesses such as cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, polyp formation and obstruction of the cystic duct. recent market price with legal certification has risen to between US $30,000 and US $50,000 per kilo. price for bear gall bladder has increased making it a lucrative trade for hunters and middlemen alike. bile products were on sale in traditional medicine shops in USA, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. bear bile powder was the most common type of product. it was usually produced and packaged by the bear farms themselves. bear bile powder was the most common type of product. prices of bear parts in china have dramatically risen. in 1970 one kilo of bear gall bladder cost around US $200. by 1990 the price had risen to between US $3,000 and US $50,000 per kilo. this has led to an increased threat to bears in the past few decades. the \"China Bear Rescue\" agreement was announced to the worldwide press. the short-term goal was to close down the worst farms in Sichuan, China. the long-term goal was to end bear farming and provide care and refuge for the remaining bears. the use of bear bile in Chinese medicine products was a problem of history, culture and economy. the use of bear bile was a problem of history, culture and economy. the use of bear bile was a problem of history, culture and economy and it might become a political issue. a systematic research has to be done on an alternative for bear bile. the definition of \"alternative\" was a kind of material, which originated from animals or plants. it should also have medicinal effects similar to that of bear bile and could totally replace it. the effects of the rabbit bile were more obvious than those of bear bile in positive inotropic action, sedation, anti-tussive action, and anti-histaminic action. these two types of gall bladders were generally considered to be able to substitute bear bile based on their chemical and pharmacological effects. UDCA was a safe and effective drug for the treatment of patients with cholesterol gallstones and chronic liver diseases. the substitutes from Chinese herbs were also found to have the efficacies of clearing heat and detoxification, purifying liver and improving eyesight. Chinese medicines under the category of plant with the efficacy of clearing heat included: Gentianae scabrae, Radix; Aloes, Herba; Paridis, Rhizoma; and Violae yedoensitis, Herba cum Radice. bear bile had the efficacy of clearing heat and detoxification. it could be used to treat eclampsia, epilepsy, tic, hot liver, red eyes and swollen problem. bear bile and Coptis could detoxify, purify liver, improve eyesight. we are doing comparative research between bear bile and Coptis. three species of plants are regarded as the genuine resource of Coptis for medical utilization. all these species can be found in Mainland China. s and its formulations were used as therapeutic agents for eye diseases and diarrhea. study summarized that s and its formulations were most commonly used for the treatment of eye diseases in some ancient medical books. this indicates that Coptis may function to benefit liver organ. these links provide some evidences even inspiration for the use of Coptis as an alternative to bear bile. berberine has many pharmacological actions with strong clinical implications. this includes antibacterial, antiviral, antiinflammatory, antineoplastic, antioxidative, antioxidative, antioxidative, antioxidative, antihyperglycemic and cholesterol-lowering effects. previous studies showed that Coptis and berberine showed promising potential as drug candidates for the treatment of liver injury. the long-term goal was to end bear farming and provide care and refuge for the remaining number of bears on farms. efforts were given in supporting the research about the manufacture and the use of herbal and synthetic substitutes to bear bile. the use of bear bile was a problem of history, culture and economy. the use of bear bile was a problem of history, culture and economy. no alternative materials could replace its integrative effects of pain-killing and anti-inflammatory for the time being. bile acid compositions of several fowls and domestic animals were preliminarily studied. the results indicated that toad bile mainly composed of CA. hyodeoxycholic acid (DCA) was found in rabbit bile. bile acids were the main effective components, which consisted of UDCA and CDCA. bears were the only mammals to produce significant amounts of UDCA. UDCA was also found in other animal species and could be extracted from pig bile and cow bile. herbal medicines were found to have the efficacies of clearing heat and detoxification, purifying liver and improving eyesight. one or more of these herbal medicines could be used as an alternative for bear bile [10,54,55] Chinese medicines under the category of plant with the efficacy of clearing heat included: Gentianae scabrae, Radix; Aloes, Herba; Paridis, Rhizoma; and Violae yedoensitis, Herba cum Radice. bear bile had the efficacy of clearing heat and detoxification, purifying liver and improving eyesight. scientists in pharmacology of Chinese medicine and Materia Medica were required to work closely with TCM practitioners to find an alternative for bear bile. a, epilepsy, tic, hot liver, red eyes and swollen problem, it did not have the functions of protecting liver and kidney according to TCM theory. as a result, scientists were required to carry out detailed research work and to propose scientific research methodology. ch, Coptis deltoidea C.Y. Cheng et Hsiao and Coptis teeta wall can be found in Mainland China. all three species can be found in Mainland China. studies in our group have established, using HPLC-MS/MS, the chemical profile of Coptis and have made comparison on the chemical composition amongst species. berberine, coptisine, palmatine, jatrorrhizine and magnoflorine are used as a criterion for quality control of the herbs. berberine is used as a criterion for quality control of the herbs. berine showed promising potential as drug candidates for liver injury. positive data add new pharmacological activities for coptis and berberine. in the ancient pharmacopeia Ben Cao Gang Mu> in ming Dynasty, Coptis and its formulations were used as therapeutic agents for eye diseases and diarrhea. the study summarized that Coptis in single dose form was most commonly used for the treatment of eye diseases in some ancient medical books. this indicates that Coptis may function to benefit liver organ, which is also seen as part of the pharmacological effect of bear bile in its traditional utilization. research on alternative for bear bile has been conducted in past decade. it was believed that the usage of bear bile is a problem of history, culture and economy and it may become a political issue. authors declare that they have no competing interests. WN retrieves data of bear bile, other animal biles and Chinese herbs from databases of Medline, Pubmed, other databases and data analyses. authors read and approved the final manuscript. the study was financially supported by grants from the research council of the university of Hong Kong."}
