{"summary": "a healthy balanced diet, active probiotic supplements and immunostimulant OM-85 may reduce recurrent infections in asthmatic children. a history of wheeze associated with respiratory viral infections early in life is one of the major risk factors for the later development of asthma. piratory viruses first infect epithelial cells which trigger an antiviral response. this response is driven by type I (/) and III () interferons (IFN) that are induced following recognition of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) toll-like receptors (TLRs) are cell surface and endosomal PRRs, while the RNA helicase receptors (RIG-I and MDA-5) the majority of viral infections in healthy individuals may spread to the lower airways, causing lower respiratory symptoms and an exacerbation of asthma. if such a response be deficient, then predominantly upper-airway viral infections, such as HRV, may spread to the lower airways, causing lower respiratory symptoms and an exacerbation of asthma. asthmatics with exacerbation-prone phenotype are susceptible to acute exacerbations requiring hospitalization or an unscheduled visit for medical attention. major risk factors for acute exacerbations include previous acute exacerbation, allergy, young age, poorly controlled asthma. acute exacerbations are associated with decreased lung growth or accelerated loss of lung function. wheezing with HRV or RSV in the first year of life was a risk factor (OR, 2.5) for current wheeze at five years of age. infant birth about four months before the winter virus peak carried the highest risk of developing asthma compared with birth 12 months before the peak. the resident microbiome is different in the presence of respiratory disease [45,46], therefore interactions between respiratory viruses and the resident pulmonary microbiome are postulated. the pulmonary and gastrointestinal microbiota influence the immune system and interventional approaches to create a healthy gut are potential strategies for the prevention of viral infections. a 21% decrease in absences due to respiratory illness in the school setting. similar programs within families would be expected to reduce transmission of HRV between family members. the authors concluded that respiratory virus spread can be reduced by hygiene measures (such as handwashing) vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risk of infections, early-life wheeze and reduced asthma control [69,70] vitamin A derivatives are involved in the regulation of the immune system and tissue inflammation as well as prevention of respiratory infections. zinc, selenium and other trace elements are necessary for function of both innate and adaptive immune function. studies have shown 40% of children live with a smoker [34] and they have approximately twice the risk of contracting a serious respiratory tract infection in early life. probiotics and prebiotics are nutrients, in particular oligosaccharides, which foster the growth of the host. the term synbiotics is used when a product contains both probiotics and prebiotics. the microbiota participates in: host metabolism, vitamin synthesis, control of epithelial cell growth. there is constant cross-talk between microbiota and gut-associated lymphoid tissue to establish mucosal immune tolerance in the gut. probiotics have been successfully used for the treatment of several gastrointestinal disorders. but attempts to prevent or treat allergic disorders have had inconsistent results. probiotics compete against pathogens; increase barrier function in respiratory epithelium; immunostimulatory effects by enhancing cellular immunity with increased activity of natural killer cells. several clinical trials showed the preventive effect of probiotic, prebiotic [132] or synbiotics treatments [133] on respiratory infections. differences in dosage, duration of intervention, population and environmental background may also affect the results. one major limitation is that it is not possible to test just how \u201cprobiotic\u201d a particular preparation is. recent studies showed that OM-85 BV can reduce the number of acute respiratory infections by 25% to 50% compared with placebo in children with a history of recurrent wheezing. the duration of each wheezing attack was two days shorter in the group given OM-85 BV than in the group given placebo (p = 0.001) the results of these clinical trials are awaited with interest. but the systemic symptoms associated with severe viral infections, e.g. influenza, are associated with interferons. vitamin D deficiency is a common worldwide problem. macrolides Macrolides have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. they can attenuate pro-inflammatory cytokine production by bronchial epithelial cells, neutrophils and macrophages. azithromycin has anti-rhinoviral activity and can reduce HRV replication and release by increasing interferon production from epithelial cells. the capsid protects the single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome. the recently discovered HRV-C was associated with sLRIs in infants, bronchiolitis, and asthma exacerbations in children. antiviral drug Pleconaril acts by binding to a hydrophobic pocket in viral protein 1. it stabilizes the protein capsid so that the virus cannot release its RNA genome into the target cell. no agent has been approved for prevention and/or therapy of rhinovirus-induced diseases so far. motavizumab was found to be superior to palivizumab in reducing outpatient medically attended lower respiratory illness by 50%. high rates of exposure to viruses in early life, presence of more than 100 serotypes of HRV, the presence of maternal antibodies, the risk of vaccine induced disease and relative immaturity of the infant immune system make effective vaccination difficult. a successful antiviral response would see the infection limited to the upper airway, as is the case clinically with the majority of viral infections in healthy individuals. if such a response be deficient, predominantly upper-airway viral infections, such as HRV, may spread to the lower airways, causing lower respiratory symptoms and an exacerbation of asthma. childhood, especially infancy, is characterized by developmentally-regulated deficiencies in innate and adaptive immunity. such deficiencies are likely to increase the risk of viral LRI in children, especially in those at high risk for asthma and allergies. research interest has focused on the role respiratory viral infections play in asthma inception. it is well established that hospitalization for RSV bronchiolitis is a risk factor for asthma during childhood. wheezing with HRV in the first year of life was a risk factor for current wheeze at five years of age. inflammation resulting from atopy and sLRI occurring during this vulnerable time is hypothesized to perturb underlying tissue differentiation programs. intervention measures that can lower the frequency and/or intensity of sLRI in early life amongst the high risk atopic subgroup of children are likely to be successful at preventing asthma. the first two methods are inefficient [50], while the third is the most important method of transmission. some evidence that the daily activities of infected people can lead to the contamination of environmental surfaces with HRV e.g. light switches, telephone dial buttons and handsets. exercise exercise has anti-inflammatory effects and in the long term can protect the development of chronic diseases and obesity. the recommended means of aerobic exercise is walking, with an optimal frequency of three to five days a week and an optimal duration of 20 to 30 minutes of continuous activity. vitamin C supplementation failed to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population except in those exposed to short periods of extreme physical stress. infants who are not breastfed have significantly higher risk of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other infections. sleep deprivation can affect immune function in several ways including reduced natural killer cell activity. popularity of probiotics and intestinal microbiota significantly increased when the Nobel Prize-winning Russian scientist suggested in 1908 that the long life of Bulgarian peasants resulted from their consumption of fermented milk products. the term probiotic, meaning for life, is used for live micro-organisms (typically of the bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species) microbiota is shaped by genetic and environmental factors including: mode of delivery, neonates born by means of vaginal delivery are exposed to mothers gut, skin, and vaginal flora. the microbiota activates distinct tolerogenic dendritic cells in the gut and through this interaction can drive regulatory T-cell differentiation. probiotics have been successfully used for the treatment of several gastrointestinal disorders. a recent cochrane review of 14 randomised controlled trials showed that probiotics were better than placebo in reducing the number of episodes of acute upper respiratory infections. there were no differences in the mean duration of an episode and no increase in adverse events. probiotic foods such as probiotic milk or yogurt may reduce the risk of catching the common cold. a subgroup analysis focusing on bacterial immunostimulants, including OM85, produced similar results with lower statistical heterogeneity. OM-85 BV can reduce the number of acute respiratory infections by 25% to 50% compared with placebo in children with a history of recurrent infection. in asthma, IFN- and IFN- responses are impaired, resulting in viral replication, cell cytotoxicity, enhanced virion shedding and increased susceptibility to common cold. if proposed deficiency of type I and III contribute to asthma exacerbations, correcting this deficiency with exogenous interferons would be a logical approach. vitamin D insufficiency has been associated with a higher incidence of respiratory tract infection, wheezing illness in children [158], reduced asthma control [159], emergency department visits, severe asthma exacerbations and hospitalizations [70,160]. macrolides Macrolides possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties extending beyond their antibacterial activity [162]. antiviral agents have been designed to inhibit rhinovirus attachment, entry to the cell, viral uncoating, and RNA and protein synthesis. the icosahedrally shaped capsid protects the single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome. anti-HRV neutralizing antibodies, anti-receptor antibodies and soluble receptor molecules were demonstrated by histamine infusion. second-generation H1-antihistamines decrease expression of ICAM-1 on cultured bronchial epithelial cells. monoclonal antibodies are effective against RSV and wheezing in children. palivizumab reduces hospitalization in high-risk individuals. a humanised monoclonal antibody against the fusion protein reduces hospitalization. the role of preventative strategies in primary prevention of asthma in high risk children is of considerable academic interest. there are no currently available practical therapies that are suitable for widespread use. all authors reviewed the articles, abstracted data, and participated in the data synthesis.
