{"summary": "novel influenza A (H1N1) is a new flu virus of swine, avian, and human origin that was first identified in mid-April 2009 in Mexico and the united states. the virus soon spread to the rest of the world and on June 11, 2009 the WHO declared novel influenza A a pandemic. the rapid spread of influenza poses a challenge to the implementation of effective mitigation strategies during the expected reemergence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the fall/winter flu season non-pharmaceutical interventions include quarantine, isolation, travel restrictions, closing of public places, fear-based self quarantine, and cancellation of events. these interventions all have economic costs to individuals and society related to lost work, increased school absenteeism, and decreased business revenues. a respirator is designed to protect the person wearing the mask against breathing in very small particles that may contain viruses. the CDC does not recommend the use of masks in home or community settings or in non-medical occupational settings. a handful of studies have analyzed the effectiveness of facemasks against nanoparticles in the size range of viruses. a study on N95 respirators and surgical masks using human subjects. the challenge aerosol used was NaCl, with particles in the size range of bacteria and viruses (.04\u20131.3m) the results showed that the lowest protection offered from N95 respirators is when particles are in the size range of 0.08\u20130.2m. study found facemasks and hand hygiene were correlated with a 35\u201351% reduction in influenza-like illness. 61.2% of respondents reported the consistent use of facemasks to prevent contracting the disease. women in the age group 50\u201359 and married respondents were more likely to wear facemasks. a respirator is designed to protect the person wearing the mask against breathing in very small particles that may contain viruses. the CDC states that the effectiveness of the use of facemasks and respirators in various settings is unknown. the CDC does not generally recommend the use of masks in home or community settings nor in non-medical occupational settings. the surgical masks are not as effective, allowing a much greater percentage of particles to pass through to the wearer even when sealed tightly to a manikin. this type of testing does not provide an accurate estimate of the level of protection for everyday use of a mask by a person. a mask will not be completely sealed on an individual nor will it fit perfectly. university of Michigan study evaluating effectiveness of hand-washing and facemasks in preventing influenza from spreading. students were randomly separated into two intervention groups. facemasks and hand hygiene were correlated with a 35\u201351% reduction in influenza-like illness. arrows that connect the boxed groups represent the movement of individuals from one group to an adjacent one. non-mask wearing exposed individuals (E) can either recover (R), die (D), or become infectious wearing a mask. a mask wearing infectious individual () can either recover (R), die (D), or stop wearing the mask while they are still infectious (I). infectious individuals can move to group D, at rate I and, when they die from infection or to group R, at rate I and, upon recovery. the infectious fraction recovers and the infectious fraction dies as a consequence of this disease. we assume that there is homogeneous mixing between groups. the force of infection is defined as the susceptibility of the population multiplied by the infectivity of the disease multiplied by the average number of contacts an individual has per day. in the force of infection, (1-) multiplies the infectious fractions because individuals in the susceptible class () are wearing masks. 0\u20131 [12] Movement Rate Between Classes 1 See text 0\u20131 See text i = S, Sm, E, Em, I, Im Number of Infecteds at which Mask are Implemented People 100 100\u201310000 See text I/N Initially Infected Fraction of the Population 1 0.00001 0\u20131 See text The Effective reproduction number,, is the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical infectious individual. the incubation period for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has been reported to be 2\u201310 days with a mean of 6 days [18]. the infectious period is believed to be between four and seven days, with an average of five days [19], [20]. the fatality rate of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is thought to be in the range of 0.3%\u20131.5%, with a mean of 0.46% [21]\u2013[23]. the case fatality rate for our model is, the baseline population size N for the model is set at one million people and all are initially in the susceptible class S. the initial population size N and the initial number of infected individuals I are both scaled up or down by the same factor. we assume that individuals will start wearing masks after 100 people are infected. number determines whether or not an epidemic occurs and its severity. when, the number of infections does not increase and there is no epidemic outbreak. the model has an initial effective reproduction number (controlled) given by: (4) this is the product of the average number of people infected per unit time. the fatality rate of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is thought to be in the range of 0.3%\u20131.5%, with a mean of 0.46% [21]\u2013[23]. the current estimates on the transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 are that one infected person may typically infect one to two people [24]\u2013[26]. the effectiveness of masks is greater because the mask contains the virus particles, preventing them from becoming airborne. the mask contains the virus particles, preventing them from becoming airborne, and therefore preventing the contamination of surrounding surfaces as well as people. varying mask effectiveness and different fractions of individuals wearing surgical masks can be seen graphically for the varying mask effectiveness.

Table 3 shows a reduction in the cumulative number of cases of almost 200,000. it is reduced from 1.83 to 1.66 when masks are 20% effective in reducing both susceptibility and infectivity and 10% of the population is wearing masks. the lowest value surgical masks reduce to 1.77. mask effectiveness The effectiveness of the mask greatly affects the number of cumulative cases. the higher the effectiveness the fewer number of cases. the number of initially infected individuals can have a major impact on the size of the epidemic. 10%, 25% and 50% of the population wear masks. the higher the percentage of the population wearing masks the fewer the number of cumulative cases. if only 10% of the population wears masks the number of cases is significantly reduced. the estimates of for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vary widely, the common range is assumed to be between 1.2 and 2.2. as the value of increases the number of pandemic cases increases significantly as shown graphically in Figure 4. Figure 4. Sensitivity to. the number of cumulative cases is very sensitive to the value of the uncontrolled effective reproduction number ( ). in a population of one million if the number of index cases is 10 there are significantly fewer cases than if the number of index cases is 1000 or 10,000. fraction of population wearing masks We consider variations in the percentage of the population wearing masks. effective reproduction number The effective reproduction number determines the average number of secondary cases resulting from one typical infectious individual during the infectious period without the implementation of facemasks. the estimates of for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vary widely, the common range is assumed to be between 1.2 and 2.2. as the value of increases the number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases increases significantly as shown graphically in Figure 4. Figure 4. Sensitivity to. The number of cumulative cases is very sensitive to the value Figure 6 shows that the higher the percentage of the population wearing masks the fewer the number of cumulative cases. even if only 10% of the population wears masks the number of cases is significantly reduced. Figure 7 shows that the earlier masks are implemented, the bigger the reduction in the cumulative number of cases. the implementation of facemasks still has a relatively large impact on the size of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009. without any interventions, we predict a large percentage of the population will be infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza strain. surgical masks lowered the effective reproduction number below one. however, N95 respirators greatly decreased, in some scenarios very close to one. there are currently more trials being conducted on the effectiveness of surgical masks and N95 respirators [32]"}
