{"summary": "mammarenaviruses are classified into two main groups, Old World (OW) and New World (NW). the OW Lassa virus (LASV), causative agent of Lassa fever (LF), is the most significant OW mammarenaviral pathogen. the most significant OW mammarenavirus is Junn virus (JUNV) a live attenuated vaccine strain of candid#1 is licensed in argentina. current anti-mammarenavirus therapy is limited to off-label use of the nucleoside analogue ribavirin that is only partially effective. such therapies include repurposing of already existing, FDA-approved drugs with strong safety profiles. mmarenavirus NP is a multifunctional protein that is involved in different steps of the virus life cycle. a primary role of NP is to encapsidate the viral genomic and antigenomic RNAs to form the nucleocapsid templates. NP counteracts the host-cell type I interferon (IFN-I) response to infection by blocking the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) through the retinoic acid in ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1) and prohibitin (PHB) were pro-viral factors. using RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knock-down and pharmacological inhibitors of ATP1A1 and PHB reduced virus multiplication significantly. r3LCMV expressing a C-terminus Strep-tag version of enhanced green fluorescent protein (r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep) we rescued rLCMV/Strep-NP and r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep. we rescued rLCMV/Strep-NP and r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep cells. vero cells treated for 16 h with tissue cultured supernatants (TCS) treated with TCS from A549 cells infected with rLCMV/NP(D382A), a mutant unable to prevent induction of IFN-I [30], and subsequently with SeV, were fully susceptible to VSV-induced CPE. A549 cells were infected (MOI = 0.1) with the indicated rLCMV or mock-infected, and 36 h later infected with SeV. at 24 h pi with rVSV, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and stained with crystal violet to assess rVSV-induced cytopathic effect. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by SYPRO Ruby protein gel staining. protein complexes in the rest of eluates from the PD samples were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation and subjected to trypsin digestion. protein complexes present in PD samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by SYPRO staining. some protein bands present only in the Strep-NP PD sample are indicated by asterisks. list of identified host-cell proteins found only in NP-strep pull down samples with at least five spectral counts. list of host-cell proteins found only in NP-strep pull down samples with at least five spectral counts.

revealed that a large number of proteins were involved in metabolic and cellular processes. we also analyzed the molecular functions of the NP-interacting protein candidates according to the PANTHER protein profile classification (Fig 2E) off-target effects are primarily driven by antisense strand microRNA (miR)-like seed activity. the antisense strand seed region is modified to drastically reduce seed-related off-targeting. normalized values from cells transfected with the control (NC, black bar) non-specific siRNA was set to 100%. 154 siRNAs including NC siRNA were evaluated three independent times. cells transfected with siRNA specific to ATP1A1 and PHB showed reduced levels in ATP1A1 and PHB protein expression. we examined whether siRNA-mediated reduced expression levels of ZsGreen correlated with reduced LCMV progeny titers. at 48 h pi cells were fixed, stained with primary mouse anti ATP1A1 or PHB antibody followed by secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 (anti-mouse IgG-AF568) cells were stained with VL-4-AF488 (anti-NP), and observed by a confocal microscope. ouabain or rocaglamide treatment resulted in a strong dose-dependent inhibition of eGFP expression in infected human- and nonhuman primate cells. this finding is consistent with rodents expressing an ATP1A1 allele that is resistant to ouabain inhibition. rocaglamide also exhibited robust anti-LCMV activity with TIs of 8.92 (CC50 = 16.4) nM, IC50 = 1.85 nM) and 5.90 (CC50 = 73.8 nM, IC50 = 12.5 nM) in A549 and Vero E6 cells respectively. multiplication of vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus was not significantly affected by either ouabain (10 nM) or rocaglamide (100 nM) eGFP expression and cell viability determined by cellTiter 96 AQueous one solution reagent. data represent means SD of the results from four (cell viability assay) or six (virus spread assay) replicates. eGFP+ cells in ouabain-treated cells were reduced at all time-of-addition points. rocaglamide treatment resulted in a negligible number of eGFP+ cells. eGFP expression in infected cells was examined by flow cytometry. cells seeded (1.25 x 105 cells/well) in 24-well plates and cultured overnight were infected (MOI = 1) with rLCMVGPC/eGFP, followed by addition of the indicated concentrations of ouabain or Roc-A. at 72 h pi, total cell lysates were prepared. data represent mean SD of four independent experiments. effects of ouabain on incorporation of viral glycoprotein into virions. 293T cells seeded (4.0 x 105 cells/well) in a 12-well plate. at 72 h pi, TCS was collected and virus titers were determined by IFFA. we infected A549 cells with a recombinant single-cycle infectious LCMV expressing eGFP (rLCMVGPC/eGFP) and treated cells with either ouabain or rocaglamide. the first experiment involved the use of a newly generated single-cycle infectious recombinant LCMV expressing the reporter gene ZsGreen (scrLCMV/ZsG-P2A-NP) to infect (MOI = 0.1) A549 cells (1st infection) at 24 h pi, we washed the infected cells to remove the extracellular virus produced during the first 24 h of infection and added fresh media containing ouabain (40 nM) we infected A549 cells with rLCMV/eGFP and treated them with ouabain and rocaglamide using different concentrations and combinations. at 48 h pi, cells were fixed and stained with DAPI. eGFP signal was normalized to DAPI signal. amide and inoculated the treated cells with recombinant LASV expressing eGFP (rLASV/eGFP) eGFP expression was examined 48 h later. eGFP expression was examined by a fluorescent plate reader. rLCMV/Strep-NP and r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep Plasmid-mediated expression of viral genes in transfected cells has been used successfully to identify virus-host-cell protein-protein interactions. this approach has the potential problem that overexpression of a single viral gene product may potentiate PPI interactions that are not relevant during the course of a natural virus infection. the fitness of rLCMV/Strep-NP and r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep was modestly decreased compared to that observed with wild-type (rLCMV ARM) and Clone 13 strains of LCMV. both rLCMV/Strep-NP and r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep had WT-like growth kinetics and reached high titers. A549 cells seeded (5.0 x 105 cells/well) in a 6-well plate and cultured overnight were infected (MOI = 0.1) with the indicated rLCMVs. at 48 h pi, total cell lysates were prepared, and protein expression was analysed by western blotting. NP has been shown to abrogate the NP\u2019s ability to counteract the induction of IFN-I production. we infected human A549 cells with either rLCMV/Strep-NP or r3LCMV/eGFP-Strep. at 48 h post-inoculation, we prepared total cell lysates for pull-down (PD) assays. a549 cells prepared in six 15-cm dishes were infected (MOI = 0.1) with either rLCMV/Strep-NP or r3LCMV/eGFP. at 48 h pi, total cell lysates were prepared, and NP- or eGFP-interacting proteins were pulled down (PD) using Streptactin-coated sepharose resin. 139 host-cell proteins found in both NP- and eGFP-PD samples were identified as NP-interacting partners. at least five spectral counts in NP-strep pull down samples with at least five spectral counts. 139 host-cell proteins were identified as NP-interacting partners. 94 60 77 T-complex protein 1 subunit epsilon CCT5 P48643 97 42 69.5 Tubulin beta-2A chain TUBB2A Q13885 96 21 58.5 Alpha-actinin-4 ACTN4 O43707 82 18 50 Filamin-B FLNB O75369 65 31 48 Nuclear cap-binding protein subunit 1 NCBP1 Q09161 51 36 43.5 Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein ribosomal protein S16 RPS16 P62249 34 4 19 Replication protein A 70 kDa DNA-binding subunit RPA1 P27694 26 10 18 Prelamin-A/C LMNA P02545 25 8 16.5 ADP/ATP translocase 2 SLC25A5 P05141 27 6 16.5 Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 7 KRT7 P08729 19 14 16.5 40S ribosomal protein S4, 11.5 Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 19 KRT19 P08727 5 17 11 Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, mitochondrial DLD P09622 19 3 11 ATP synthase subunit alpha, mitochondrial ATP5A1 P25705 7 15 11 DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit PRKDC P78527 10 12 11 Splicing factor 3B subunit 3 SF3B3 Q15393 P2Q9 14 3 8.5 60 kDa SS-A/Ro ribonucleoprotein TROVE2 P10155 13 3 8 40S ribosomal protein S9 RPS9 P46781 11 5 8 Nuclear cap-binding protein subunit 2 NCBP2 P52298 7 9 8 39S ribosomal protein L12, mitochondrial MRPL12 P52815 10 6 8 40S ribosomal protein L12, mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 RPL19 P84098 8 5 6.5 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial OGDH Q02218 6 7 6.5 Leucine-rich repeat flightless-interacting protein 1 LRRFIP1 Q32MZ4 6 7 6.5 Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 TXNDC5 Q8NBS9 4 9 6.5 60S acidic ribosomal protein P0 RPLP0 P05 15233 8 3 5.5 Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit TIM50 TIMM50 Q3ZCQ8 9 2 5.5 DNL-type zinc finger protein DNLZ Q5SXM8 9 2 5.5 Putative elongation factor 1-alpha-like 3 EEF1A1P5 Q5VTE0 6 5 5.5 Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like protein 1 HNRNPUL1 Q9BUJ the protein annotation through evolutionary relationship (PANTHER) protein family classification (Biological Process) of the NP-interacting protein candidates revealed that a large number of proteins were involved in metabolic and cellular processes. RNAi-mediated knockdown expression of NP-interacting host-cell proteins on multiplication of LCMV expressing reporter gene ZsGreen (ZsG) in a549 cells. the siRNAs we used were from the genome-wide ON TARGET-Plus (OTP) human siRNA library (18,301 genes, 4 siRNAs/gene) effects of knock-down of genes identified LC-MS/MS analysis on LCMV multiplication. A549 cells (1,000 cells/well) in a 384-well plate were reverse transfected with siRNA pools targeting each indicated gene. at 72 h post-transfection, cells were fixed and stained with DAPI. a549 cells were reverse-transfected with siRNAs against ATP1A1 or with NC siRNA. 72 h later, cells were infected with rLCMV/ZsG. confocal microscopy examined the co-localization of NP with ATP1A1 and PHB in LCMV-infected cells. weighted co-localization coefficients were significantly higher than non-weighted CC, indicating the presence of brighter pixels in the co-localized regions. weighted CC were determined by taking into consideration the brightness of each channel signal. p values were determined by a two-tailed paired t test using GraphPad Prism software. ouabain had TIs of 4.99 (CC50 = 28.9 nM, IC50 = 5.79 nM [log108.237M]) and 3.81 (CC50 = 70.0 nM, IC50 = 18.4 nM) in A549 and Vero E6 cells. rocaglamide had TIs of >105 (CC50 > 1000 nM, IC50 = 9.51 nM) and 10.3 (CC50 = at 24 and 48 h pi, TCSs were collected, and virus titers were determined by IFFA. data represent means SD of results from three independent experiments. ATP1A1 and PHB are involved in different steps of the mammarenavirus life cycle. rocaglamide treatment resulted in a negligible number of eGFP+ cells. A549 cells seeded (2.5 x 105 cells/well) in a 12-well plate and cultured overnight were infected (moi = 0.1) with rLCMV/eGFP or remained uninfected (mock) eGFP expression in infected cells was examined by flow cytometry. at 24 h pi, cells were washed with fresh media to eliminate infectious virus particle produced in the absence of compound treatment. cells were cultured for another 24 h in fresh media in the presence of ouabain. GP-incorporation efficiency was estimated by dividing ZsGreen signal intensity in BHK-21 cell lysate by that in 293T cell lysate (1st). data represent means SD from three independent experiments. the effects of ouabain and rocaglamide on the late step of the arenavirus life cycle, Z-mediated budding. at 24 h post-transfection, we removed the tissue culture supernatant (TCS) and washed extensively transfected cells to eliminate already budded Z. treatment with ouabain caused a reduction in both LCMV and LASV Z budding efficiency. the second experiment involved infection (MOI = 0.1) of cells with LCMV. 48 h later we washed infected cells three times to remove extracellular infectious progeny produced during the first 48 h of infection. results from both experiments consistently showed that ouabain did not inhibit assembly de novo of extracellular infectious virus. at 48 h pi, cells were fixed and stained with DAPI. eGFP signal was normalized to DAPI signal. data represent % synergy at 95% confidence interval. ATP1A1 and PHB function as pro-viral factors of a range of mammarenaviruses. these findings indicate that ATP1A1 and PHB function as pro-viral factors of a range of mammarenaviruses. NP interactomes are important cell targets during natural mammarenavirus infections. but have low transfection efficiency. differences in experimental conditions and analysis methodologies used to generate the LCMV NP interactome documented by King et al. inhibitor-B kinase (NP-IKK) was identified as an NP-binding protein using plasmid-mediated overexpression in transfected cells [47] this discrepancy may have been caused by very low expression of IKK in LCMV-infected cells. NP-IKK interaction could be temporarily regulated and take place at early times pi. a low concentration of ouabain induces conformational change in ATP1A1. this results in activation and release of proto-oncogene tyrosine protein kinase, Src, from ATP1A1 followed by activation of downstream signaling that inhibits cell entry of murine hepatitis virus. rocaglamide inhibits protein synthesis by targeting eIF4A. kd expression via siRNA resulted in increased LCMV multiplication. MAP1B may have anti-LCMV activity. NS1 and NS2 of human respiratory syncytial virus antagonizes host IFN-I response by reducing levels of TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF3), IKK (NS1), and STAT2 (NS2) [65]. NS2-MAP1B interaction interfered with HRSV NS2\u2019s ability to reduce levels of STAT2, whereas the role of NS1-MAP1B interaction remains to be determined. eronin-containing T-complex (CCT) were identified as prominent hits in our NP interactome. the mammalian CCT is critical for folding of many proteins with important functions in diverse cellular processes. members of the CCT have been implicated in multiplication of different viruses including rabies virus [76, 77], HCV [78] and FLUAV [79]. pro- and antiviral host-cell factors identified in this study in mammarenavirus multiplication will advance our understanding of the multiple functions of NP. drugs that are already approved can be repurposing as therapeutics to combat human pathogenic mammarenavirus infections. pol1S Cl-13 plasmids directed pol1-mediated intracellular synthesis of recombinant LCMV S genome RNA species coding for Strep-tagged NP or eGFP. rLCMV expressing eGFP (rLCMV/eGFP) was generated as described [85] and rLCMV expressing ZsGreen (rLCMV/ZsG) instead of eGFP was generated by reverse genetics. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were stained with a rat mAb to NP (VL-4, Bio X Cell, West Lebanon, NH) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (VL-4-AF488, Protein Labeling Kit, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) al antibodies to -tubulin (QIAGEN), eGFP (Takara Bio USA, Mountain View, CA), GP2 (We33/36), ATP1A1 (TehrmoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL), PHB (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies to -tubulin (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogen lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 3,900 x g at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. cell lysate was then incubated with strep-tactin sepharose resin (QIAGEN) at 4\u00b0C. after 2 h of incubation, the resin was washed three times with PD lysis buffer (+) and once with PD lysis buffer without TritonX-100 (PD lysis buffer [\u2013]).

Reversed phase particles (2 cm, C18 Aqua, 3-m diameter, 125 pores, Phenomenex) were then successively packed onto the capillary tube using the same method as SCX loading. MudPIT experiments (10-step) were performed in which each step corresponds to 0, 10, 20, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100% buffer C (500 mM of ammonium acetate, 0.1% formic acid, and 5% acetonitrile) data analysis Protein and peptide identification were performed with Integrated Proteomics Pipeline\u2014IP2 (Integrated Proteomics Applications, San Diego, CA) siRNA target host-cell proteins were selected based on availability of validated siRNA sequences. at 72 h post-transfection, cells were infected (MOI = 0.05) with rLCMV/ZsG. siRNA target host-cell proteins were selected based on availability of validated siRNA sequences. cells infected with eGFP- or ZsGreen-expressing rLCMV were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS. after cell permeabilization by treatment with DB, cells were incubated with primary mouse anti ATP1A1 or PHB antibody followed by secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluore 568. each pixel was assigned a value of 1. co-localization coefficients (CC) were determined by dividing the sum of green-and red-positive pixels by the sum of green positive pixels. comparison of non-weighted and weighted CC allowed us to determine whether brighter pixels were present in the co-localized regions. eGFP levels in clarified cell lysates adjusted to same total protein concentration with cell lysis buffer were measured by a fluorescent plate reader. plasmid expressing pC-LCMV-Z-Strep was generated using similar procedure to generate a plasmid expressing pC-LCMV-Z-Strep-tagged LASV Z protein. cells were transfected with 0.5 g of empty pCAGGS vector or pC-LCMV-Z-Strep or pC-LASV-Z-FLAG. at 5 h post-transfection, media were replaced with fresh media and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 19 h. cells were cultured in fresh medium containing ouabain (30 or 40 nM) or rocaglamide (50 or 100 nM) 293T cells seeded (4.0 x 105 cells/well) were infected with scrLCMV/ZsG-P2A-NP for 2 h. at 24 h pi, cells were three times washed with fresh media. at 48 h pi, cells were three times washed with fresh media to eliminate infectious virus particle produced in the absence of compound treatment. at 48 h pi, cells were fixed, permeabilized by treatment with DB. eGFP readouts were normalized by DAPI readouts. eGFP expression was observed by a fluorescent microscope. vero E6 cells seeded in a 24-well plate (1.25 x 105 cells/well) and cultured overnight were treated with 3-fold dilutions of bufalin for 2 h. at 48 h pi, cells were fixed to examine eGFP expression and cell viability as determined by CellTiter 96 AQueous one solution reagent. at 48 h pi, cells were fixed and stained with DAPI. eGFP signal was normalized to DAPI signal. data represent means SD of the results from six replicates."}
