{"summary": "HCMV infection induced a 2.5-fold increase in UTP concentration at 48 hours postinfection (hpi) before 48 hpi, at 6 and 24 hpi, there was no change in UTP concentrations upon infection. HCMV infection substantially induced the turnover of the unlabeled UTP pool upon 13C-glucose labeling. HCMV infection induced an approximately fourfold increase in UTP metabolic flux at 48 hpi. human fibroblasts were infected with HCMV [multiplicity of infection = 3] and treated with DMSO or various concentrations of PALA or Leflunomide (Fig. 2C) both inhibitors also blocked the HCMV-induced expansion of UTP and CTP pools (Fig. S1C) MRC5 cells were HCMV-infected (MOI = 3.0), treated with DMSO, PALA (B) or Leflunomide (C) at the indicated concentrations, and harvested at 96 hpi for analysis of viral progeny (mean SEM, n = 4). ling enzyme of pyrimidine biosynthesis analyzed CAD protein levels. HCMV infection increased Thr-456 phosphorylation at 48 hpi. transfection with CAD siRNA, but not control siRNA, successfully reduced CAD protein levels. the impact of pyrimidine biosynthetic inhibition on HCMV infection. MRC5 cells were HCMV-infected (MOI = 3.0) and treated with DMSO, PALA (100 M), or 50 M uridine as indicated. cells were harvested at 24 and 72 hpi for metabolite analysis. LC-MS/MS\u2013derived ion counts were normalized to mock-infected samples. a number of pyrimidine end products were substantially decreased by PALA treatment. HCMV infection induced a modest increase in UDP\u2013glucose flux and a larger increase in UDP\u2013sugar pool sizes. MRC5 cells were mock- or HCMV-infected (MOI = 3.0) and treated with DMSO or 100 M PALA. MRC5 cells were labeled with 13C\u2013glucose for 0, 1, 2, or 6 h. they were processed for LC-MS/MS to measure fraction of 12C\u2013UDP\u2013glucose (C) or 12C\u2013UDP\u2013GlcNAc (D) flux estimates were calculated as indicated in SI Materials and Methods. we examined gB accumulation at 72 hpi in the presence of DMSO, PALA, and uridine. this resulted in a decrease in the mature 116-kDa glycosylated form. these changes were reversed with uridine medium supplementation. the total amount of gB was also reduced with PALA treatment. MRC5 cells were HCMV-infected (MOI = 3.0), treated with DMSO or tunicamycin (10 g/mL) and harvested at 96 hpi. abundances of gB and GAPDH were measured by Western analysis. MRC5 cells were HCMV-infected as in A and treated with PALA (100 M) in the presence of uridine (50 M), UDP\u2013glucose (5 M), or UDP\u2013GlcNAc (100 M) as indicated. supernatant virions were partially purified at 144 hpi and analyzed for associated viral genomes. supplementation with either UDP\u2013GlcNAc or UDP\u2013glucose restored viral growth in the presence of pyrimidine biosynthetic inhibition. the link between pyrimidine biosynthesis and UDP\u2013sugar production is important for the replication of evolutionarily disparate viruses. HCMV replication in A3-treated cells could be rescued with the addition of uridine, UDP\u2013GlcNAc, orotate. a3 treatment also reduced influenza A growth, which could be rescued with medium supplemented with orotate or UDP\u2013GlcNAc. cells were treated with A3 (2.5 M) in the presence of orotate (2.5 mM) or UDP\u2013GlcNAc (100 M) as indicated. at 48 hpi, the supernatants were collected for viral titration in vero cells. HCMV-mediated induction of UTP levels appears to be dependent on viral gene expression, but not viral DNA replication. infection with UV-irradiated HCMV or treatment with cycloheximide blocked induction of UTP pools, as opposed to treatment with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), an inhibitor of viral DNA synthesis. HCMV infection substantially induced the turnover of the unlabeled UTP pool upon 13C-glucose labeling. measure of pool concentrations and pool-labeling kinetics enables estimation of UTP biosynthetic flux (25). HCMV infection induced an approximately fourfold increase in UTP metabolic flux at 48 hpi. leflunomide has been reported to possess additional activities unrelated to DHODH inhibition (27) we supplemented viral growth medium with uridine, which enables UMP formation through the salvage pathway downstream of the biosynthetic enzymes targeted. uridine fully rescued viral replication during PALA treatment. MRC5 cells were treated with 100 M PALA, 100 M Leflunomide, DMSO, or 1% ethanol (+ control) for 24 h. CAD is a rate-controlling enzyme of pyrimidine biosynthesis (20, 21) transfection with CAD-specific siRNA successfully reduced CAD protein levels. siRNA-mediated targeting of CAD attenuates HCMV replication. pyrimidine biosynthesis and CAD expression are important for high-titer HCMV replication. analysis of viral DNA abundance indicated that ALA treatment decreased viral DNA abundance by 3.3-fold. the addition of exogenous uridine to infected cells did not rescue the observed reduction in the viral DNA pool. this finding suggests that the reduced level of viral DNA replication that occurs with PALA treatment is sufficient to enable the production of wild-type levels of viral progeny. a number of pyrimidine end products were substantially decreased by PALA treatment. a CAD inhibitor abolished the HCMV-induced increases in N-carbamoyl-l-aspartate. HCMV infection substantially expanded UDP\u2013glucose and UDP\u2013GlcNAc pools. MV infection induced a modest increase in UDP\u2013glucose flux. HCMV specifically targets UDP\u2013sugar metabolism, inducing UDP\u2013sugar biosynthesis and increasing UDP\u2013sugar pool sizes. MRC5 cells were mock- or HCMV-infected (MOI = 3.0) and treated with DMSO or 100 M PALA. HCMV encodes many viral proteins that are glycosylated. the nascent protein (105 kDa) is first glycosylated, giving rise to an 170-kDa product. the nascent protein (105 kDa) is cleaved to form the mature protein. the total amount of gB was reduced with uridine supplementation. the total amount of gB was also reduced with PALA treatment. the glycosylation of CD44S was not impacted by treatment with PALA for 72 h. MRC5 cells were infected with HCMV (MOI = 3.0), treated with DMSO or tunicamycin (10 g/mL), and harvested at 72 hpi. the abundance of CD44S was measured by Western analysis. cells were HCMV-infected (MOI = 1.0) and treated with DMSO or 100 M PALA. supernatant virions were partially purified at 144 hpi. pfu/genome ratio is indicated relative to wild-type infection. the amount of genomes per pfu was substantially higher upon PALA treatment. the amount of genomes per pfu was substantially higher upon PALA treatment. a small change in comparison with the larger reduction in secreted pfu upon PALA treatment. orotate, but not UDP\u2013GlcNAc, rescued viral replication in MHV-treated cells. link between pyrimidine biosynthesis and UDP\u2013sugar metabolism is important for replication of evolutionarily diverse viruses. MRC5 cells were infected with HCMV (MOI = 3.0) at 48 hpi, the supernatants were collected for viral titration in vero cells (mean SEM) 293T\u2013mCEACAM1 cells were infected with rMHV\u2013GFP (MOI = 0.0005) cells were treated with A3 (2.5 M) in the presence of orotate (2.5 mM) or UDP\u2013GlcNAc (100 M) as indicated. exogenously added uridine does not have immediate access to purine deoxynucleotide pools. these results suggest that viral DNA is normally produced in substantial excess of what is required for the production of infectious viral progeny. pyrimidine biosynthetic inhibition dramatically reduced UDP\u2013sugar pools in infected, but not in uninfected cells. despite their importance, the mechanisms through which viruses modulate the metabolic processes responsible for specific glycosyl linkages are not known. this results highlight the possibility that the mechanisms through which viruses target this link may prove to be a vulnerability shared by diverse viral types. all statistical analysis was performed with Origin (Version 8.0) as described in SI Materials and Methods.
