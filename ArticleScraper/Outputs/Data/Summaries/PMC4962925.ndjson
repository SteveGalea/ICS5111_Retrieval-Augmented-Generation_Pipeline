{"summary": "community-based surveillance and control interventions have been heavily promoted. but the most effective interventions have not been identified. results Fifty-seven studies were included. outbreak control interventions for Nipah virus and SARS are effective but may not be suitable for ongoing control. canine vaccination and education is more acceptable than culling, but still fails to reach coverage levels required to effectively control rabies. the absence of effective surveillance and control programs, prevailing socio-cultural practices and weak public health and veterinary services infrastructure exacerbates the vulnerability of these settings. other factors including climate change, environmental degradation, encroachment of humans on areas where wildlife exists, and the mixing of species in live animal markets play a role in increased disease transmission. may et al.7 review evidence for syndromic surveillance systems in developing countries. but neither review was able to state whether surveillance systems are achieving the ultimate goal of detecting outbreaks early. most evaluations of surveillance programs focused on evaluating the practical structure and operation of the system. control of emerging infectious disease requires an effective response to surveillance data. single measures such as the use of vaccines or antiviral drugs may be unavailable, unaffordable or not in sufficient quantity. over the last decade there have been increased efforts to promote community-based infectious disease control. behavioural mechanisms operate through the experiences, beliefs and values of groups and individuals. this framework was used in a synthetic review of water and sanitation projects. review objective/questions The objective of this review is to identify the effectiveness of surveillance systems and community-based interventions. the review was limited to the ten member countries of the association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN)18. the list of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic infections published on the CDC website19 as commonly occurring in Southeast Asia. rabies Nipah virus dengue SARS, and avian influenza Types of intervention(s) of interest. studies that reported any type of quantitative infection/disease/outbreak outcome data or morbidity and mortality rates attributable to the infectious disease. this includes rates of infection, numbers of cases of infection reported and confirmed mortality rates attributable to the infectious disease, number of outbreaks, time/size of epidemic peak, duration of outbreak/epidemic. systematic reviews/meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after trials, interrupted time series. mixed-method studies included one of the above, and systematic review and economic evaluations that were based on one of the above. syndromic surveillance programs, communications programs, training/education of health workers and community workers to detect and/or prevent disease, local level surveillance & response teams, web surveillance. following the One Health20 concept of a synergistic approach to health we will also include animal/livestock surveillance systems where they are specifically evaluated. we categorise indicators based around the WHO framework for monitoring and evaluation of surveillance and response systems for communicable disease21. results of activities such as training sessions delivered, guidelines developed or number of sites monitored, Output indicators: The extent to which the surveillance and response objectives are being achieved. quantitative component of the review extracts data from included studies on all disease outcomes and process indicators measured. the textual component of the review considers the textual information included in the introduction, methods and discussion of all papers included in this systematic review. data was extracted from papers included in the review using a data extraction tool specifically developed for this review. the tool was drafted during protocol development and piloted on a subset of studies across the five diseases. the final tool still captured key details about the interventions evaluated and the methods and outcomes used in the evaluations. behavioural interventions were synthesised in a narrative summary with the aid of tables and figures. we used the frameworks for evaluating infectious disease surveillance systems and behavioural interventions outlined in the background section. for surveillance activities we grouped abstracted information according to the CDC criterion for evaluating surveillance activities. the Bayesian meta-analysis easily copes with zero cells, for example, no positive results from a control village. results were expressed as odds ratios, for example the number of containers tested positive for mosquitoes per 100 sampled. uncertainty in estimates is expressed as a 95% credible interval. a credible interval contains a 95% probability of containing the true estimate. the correct interpretation relies on imagining repeating the study multiple times. haemorrhagic fever (RDHF) is the number of cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever per 100,000 population Meta-analysis Comparable study findings from individual studies were combined statistically in a meta-analysis. this approach allowed us to increase the power of the analysis, improve the precision of our estimates of an intervention and assess whether an intervention was similar in similar situations. we chose not to use the Frequentist meta-analysis built into the JBI-MAStARI statistical software. the meta-analysis of count data weights all results by study size. results were expressed as odds ratios. results were expressed as rate ratios. contains a 95% probability of containing the true estimate, in comparison to 95% confidence intervals. correct interpretation relies on repeating the study multiple times, calculating multiple confidence intervals, and then counting the number of times the true estimate is contained in the intervals. sensitivity analysis was used to show the influence of each study on the summary odds or rate ratio. of the 57 papers included in the systematic review, 19 studies looked at surveillance interventions25\u201343. of the 57 papers included, 19 studies looked at surveillance interventions25\u201343 and 44 studies presented data on prevention and control interventions. retrospective cohorts, 34, 51, 63, 69, 73, 75 and retrospective analysis of interventions using outbreak or surveillance data were short-listed for comprehensive examination from the original list of 1694. the majority of the original articles (103) and six systematic reviews were excluded after reading the abstract and an overview of the contents of the paper. study by Kamoltham et al.54 reports on a five-year rabies control program in the Phetchabun province of Thailand between 1997 and 2001. authors use the number of human deaths during the program to measure success of the vaccination program. but this is confounded by the increased uptake of post-exposure prophylaxis as result of expansion of the existing treatment regimen. the study by Kamoltham et al.54 presents the number of potentially exposed cases who received treatment from rabies treatment centres, hospitals and clinics in Phetchabun province. a census of the dog population and canine vaccination coverage was also carried out by the Livestock Department of Phetchabun during the program. 67, 81 The study by Kamoltham et al.54 mentions canine sterilisation. however, no data is presented on the latter. the results measure is the proportion of dogs vaccinated. poor understanding of vaccination also contributed to refusal to participate. good engagement of the community was also vital for vaccination. owner not wanting to cause injury to the dog from vaccination. the outcome measure used was the proportion of dogs vaccinated in three studies. results for interventions targeted at Nipah virus 89 papers were short-listed for more comprehensive examination from the original list of 534. the national sero-surveillance program initiated post-outbreak to detect any remaining infected pig farms and abattoirs not already depopulated. the number of abattoirs and farms tested and proportion positive for Nipah virus is presented. there are no studies that report quantitative data on the functioning of these systems. strategies of herd health monitoring and improved farm management practices were also briefly discussed by Mohd Nor. the outbreak caused dramatic changes in the pig industry. pig farming only allowed in pig farming areas designated by the government. the transmission of Nipah virus was thought to be related to the movement of fruit bat populations in farming areas. results for interventions targeted at dengue The original searches retrieved 1302 potentially relevant articles. 118 papers were short-listed for more comprehensive examination. 87 articles were rejected after perusal of abstract and full text. the remaining studies were undertaken in northern, central and southern provinces. the remaining studies were undertaken in Singapore44 (n=1), Malaysia48 (n=1), Myanmar76 (n=1), Cambodia69 (n=1), the Philippines59, 76 (n=2) and Indonesia45, 70, 77 (n=3) a major limitation of the body of evidence evaluating prevention and control activities is the reliance on entomological indices to evaluate program effectiveness. eighteen47, 49, 52, 56\u201359, 61, 62, 64\u201366, 70\u201372, 74, 76, 77 use larval indices as a main outcome measure. fourteen studies38, 44, 49, 55\u201357, 61, 64, 66, 69, 71, 72 used numbers seven studies had a follow up of 6 months or less,44, 49, 59, 64, 70, 76, 77 four of less than one year,38, 48, 53, 65 and eight had a follow up of less than two years45, 47, 52, 58, 71, 72, 74, 79. short duration of follow-up also limits interpretation of the sustainability of results. one study41 reported data on the cost of the surveillance system. poor record keeping impacted on assessment of the system's timeliness. study based on a variety of methods including environmental, biological and chemical vector control and dengue disease awareness campaigns. interventions evaluated were based on a variety of methods including environmental, biological and chemical vector control. study found a 60% reduction in households positive for Aedes aegypti. however, the vector was not present in the control area at baseline. the number of households positive for Aedes aegypti increased toward the end of the study period. six studies evaluated the use of the copepod Mesocyclops as a biological control agent in water containers. the other six studies included health education and disease awareness, and environmental cleanup activities as part of the control program. the average cost of the program was calculated to be 61c per person per year (equivalent to a total cost of $6,134 annually) in international Dollars. the project rated 4.42 out of 5 indicating it was highly sustainable. the impact of larviciding on dengue notifications was greatest during an outbreak than under endemic conditions. the impact of dengue spraying on dengue notifications was greatest during an outbreak than under endemic conditions. in the Philippines, introduction of biological agents (dragon-fly nymphs and fish) to the most productive water containers was compared to a blanket approach where all containers were targeted. in the Philippines, the targeted vector control program had lower implementation costs ($4.47 per year per household covered) than the non-targeted campaign. sixteen of the 26 studies included study sites in rural locations. these included health education, environmental vector control strategies and biological vector control strategies. four studies looked at effectiveness of control programs in urban settings. a health education and temephos larviciding program was more effective in epidemic than inter-epidemic years. butraporn et al. reported poor wastewater management and a lack of affordability of piped water in their study. dengue control activities were less successful when not combined with health education and awareness building activities. but vanlerberghe et al. found that disease knowledge was not correlated with uptake or correct use of the curtains79 and Butraporn et al.79. participants failed to see reductions in mosquito and dengue rates. community involvement in the intervention was passive, i.e. they received the program. community involvement was active in education, environmental and biological control programs. Nam61 report that continuous community input is required into their intervention based around use of copepods and environmental clean up to prevent reinfestation with the dengue vector. Crabtree et al. report spin-off benefits to the community from participating. Nam et al.'s evaluation of a biological and environmental control program in Viet Nam cites the importance of recycling as an economic activity as one of the reasons why clean up campaigns were successful in reducing entomological indices. the cost to participants of the intervention may facilitate or inhibit success of the program. the intervention included microcredit schemes for small businesses that were based around recycling and waste removal. communes in Viet Nam which received a rollout of their biological, environmental and educational intervention without support from a technical program team achieved lower reductions in entomological and epidemiological indices than the original project sites. however, there was tension between the village health volunteers used in their surveillance system and official health staff. household index Ten studies measured household index as an outcome measure. dengue control interventions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in household index. sensitivity analysis showed the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each individual study. the meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the Breteau index. the forest plot shows homogeneity between studies (Figure 3), and the sensitivity analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each individual study. analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each individual study. dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in the mosquito bite rate. dengue control interventions led to a non-significant reduction in dengue haemorrhagic fever. the results of the meta-analysis showed that overall, the interventions included in this review were able to show a statistically significant impact on larval indices. effectiveness does not appear to vary by country or urban/rural context. only three studies56, 66, 72 included in the meta-analysis reported data on both larval and dengue outcomes. all showed consistency in the direction of the effect across outcomes, but all showed a bigger reduction in larval indices than number of dengue infections. interventions based on health education, environmental and biological vector control appear to be effective, low cost, well accepted, and sustainable in both urban and rural settings. single study comparing environmental clean-up with repeat fogging found that environmental cleanup was more effective at reducing mosquito numbers than the chemical control program. nine systematic reviews that were identified were also excluded, as these focused on either a geographical region outside of the scope of this review. four of the five were from Singapore34, 51, 63, 73 with the remaining study originating from Viet Nam75. study focuses on the use of staff electronic medical records for early detection of outbreaks of febrile illness. study finds that as documented fever is rare in sick leave amongst staff, passive surveillance in healthcare workers would be efficient in identifying outbreaks of febrile illness. three of the studies are from Singapore51, 63, 73 and evaluated the effectiveness of home isolation and quarantine protocols and its contact tracing policy. all of the studies were based on retrospective analyses of the same outbreak dataset. only 0.3% of those quarantined broke quarantine; one quarter of all SARS cases had been on quarantine orders prior to diagnosis. all four studies of prevention and control activities highlighted specific epidemiological features of SARS that made it more amenable to control. patients were only infectious whilst symptomatic. this makes it easier to identify when and where interventions need to be put in place for infected individuals to prevent transmission. study by Tuan et al.75 did not provide any contextual information about why people did not wear masks. five studies were included in the review, one looking at a work-based surveillance system in a Singapore hospital, and one from Viet Nam reporting on the effectiveness of masks in reducing risk of SARS in people exposed to SARS patients. four studies evaluated prevention and control interventions in the form of education,46, 60, 78, 80. the surveillance program conducted in Indonesia also incorporated a prevention and control component. the authors admit several constraints identified during the implementation of the program impacted on the quality of the study. the study evaluated changes in poultry handling behaviours before and after educational campaigns. there were differences in sampling methods in 2006 survey (pre-intervention) compared to 2007 survey (post-intervention) a comprehensive evaluation was conducted by Perry et al. in 2009. the system focused on the detection of HPAI in the backyard poultry sector. it was later expanded to have a prevention and control component. the study focused on targeted surveillance of markets, semi-commercial poultry farms located in former outbreak areas, sentinel village monitoring to strengthen surveillance at village level and serological surveillance of domestic duck farms. the study did not detect HPAI in the market (0/712) or farm (0/51) samples. four studies were identified where education and training were the main component of the prevention and control interventions. all of them were conducted in the mekong region, which comprises Viet Nam, Cambodia and Lao PDR. the programs were aimed at communities in rural settings, focusing on increasing awareness of HPAI,46. study by waisbord et al. was a large undertaking, with training delivered to 3840 district and commune women's union officers in Viet Nam, 810 village promoters in Cambodia and 93 reporters and editors in lao PDR. only in the Viet Namese study do they report pre- and post-intervention KAP scores, reporting an increase from 54% to 92%. lack of cooperation reported in study by Desvaux et al. from farmers reluctant to have animals bled for studies. PDSR program in Indonesia had very positive impacts on revitalising veterinary services in Indonesia. a total of 5131 potentially relevant titles were identified by the literature search. of these, 538 abstracts of potentially relevant papers identified by the literature search were examined. 417 papers were excluded after evaluation of the abstract. study designs used to evaluate prevention and control activities included:experimental before and after studies,49, 50, 60, 78, 80, 81 observational prospective comparable cohorts,38, 39, 44, 45, 47, 48, 52, 53, 55\u201362, 64\u201366, 71, 74, 77 prospective cohort studies,67, 70, 72, 79 retrospective cohorts,34, 51, 63, 69, 73, 75. the full text articles of 16 studies were retrieved. six studies were assessed for methodological quality. one was excluded at this stage82 as it only measured one time point. the authors use the number of human deaths during the rabies control program to measure success of the vaccination program. but this is confounded by the increased uptake of post-exposure prophylaxis as a result of expansion of the existing treatment regimen. they also mention increasing awareness of rabies through advocacy in provincial schools, television programs, and newspapers. the study by Soon et al.68 presents veterinary surveillance data carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture. they also mentions surveillance of human cases of rabies infection by the Ministry of Health. they do not mention how the outbreak was detected or whether any form of surveillance was in place prior to the outbreak. despite the aggressive vaccination campaign from 1996 \u2013 2001, the number of exposures to suspected and proven rabid animals continued to increase from 1992 \u2013 2000. despite the aggressive vaccination campaign from 1996 \u2013 2001, the number of exposures to suspected and proven rabid animals continued to increase from 1992 \u2013 2000. owners had right to refuse to have dogs repeatedly bled. the study may also have been compromised as a result of dog owners demanding financial compensation for dogs handed over. results for interventions targeted at Nipah virus 89 papers were short-listed for more comprehensive examination from the original list of 534. seven studies were critically appraised for methodological quality and subsequently included in the review. studies in the Philippines50, 67 and Indonesia81 do not mention ongoing rabies surveillance. the outbreak on Flores Island was reported by word of mouth by local fishermen when three dogs died. despite the aggressive vaccination campaign from 1996 \u2013 2001, the number of exposures to suspected and proven rabid animals continued to increase from 1992 \u2013 2000. inability to enforce movement restrictions, culling of diseased animals and incomplete vaccination coverage contributed to failure to control the outbreak on Flores Island. both Kamoltham et al.54 and Windiyaningsih et al.81 mention decentralisation of services in Thailand and Indonesia impacting on the ability to obtain complete data in the latter. lack of coordination between local authorities made it difficult to contain the infected dog population. two studies were outbreak reports of the Malaysian outbreak epidemic29, 30 and present an epidemic curve of the number of human cases by the date of onset of their illness. four studies also discussed the national Swine Surveillance Program and subsequent control measures initiated by the Malaysian government in response to the outbreak. human and swine surveillance was instigated in Malaysia as a measure of active case finding to guide outbreak control measures. the national Swine Surveillance Program in Malaysia on farms was carried out till the end of December 2000 to detect and cull additional infected herds. the eradication of 1.1 million swine represented about 40% of the swine population in Malaysia in 199929. many pig farmers lost their livelihoods with the culling of their entire pig farm. there was no evidence of a surveillance system in place to provide early warning of the outbreak. despite many reports of ongoing surveillance activities there has been no evaluation of these systems. six studies evaluated effectiveness of community-based surveillance programs for dengue. these studies came from different countries (Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Malaysia) 28 studies report on 28 evaluations of dengue prevention and control activities. seven studies55\u201358, 61, 62, 65 looked at biological vector control strategies. in all studies this was in combination with dengue education and environmental control activities. no ongoing routine veterinary or human surveillance appears to have been in place. despite descriptive reports of on-going surveillance activities to aid trace back,36 there are no studies that report quantitative data on the functioning of these systems. strategies of herd health monitoring and improved farm management practices were briefly discussed by Mohd Nor. many pig farmers lost their livelihoods with the culling of their entire pig farm. the outbreak caused dramatic changes in the pig industry. pig farming only allowed in pig farming areas designated by the government. despite reports of ongoing surveillance activities there has been no evaluation of these systems. results for interventions targeted at dengue The original searches retrieved 1302 potentially relevant articles. from this list, 118 papers were short-listed for more comprehensive examination. three studies evaluated community dengue health education and disease awareness campaigns. five studies44, 47, 49, 55\u201357, 61, 62, 66, 69\u201372 included environmental control activities alongside chemical or biological control interventions. sufficient follow up periods, inappropriate or no control groups, do not control for confounding factors such as seasonality and epidemic pattern of disease. Biological control \u2013 high quality for national studies (sample size and follow up periods adequate, do not control for confounding factors such as seasonality), low quality for local level studies (small sample size, no or inappropriate control groups, report vector and disease outcomes) seven studies had a follow up of 6 months or less,44, 49, 59, 64, 70, 76, 77 four of less than one year,38, 48, 53, 65 and eight had a follow up of less than two years45, 47, 52, 58, 71, 72, 79. short duration of follow-up also limits interpretation of the sustainability of results. study41 reported data on the cost of the surveillance system. poor record keeping impacted on assessment of the system's timeliness. no other qualities of the system were evaluated. a higher proportion of patients were positive by serology (33% vs 7%) and virus isolation (50% vs 15%) using the latter case definition. the spatial analysis would allow focusing control activities on 5% of the months to control 37% of cases. the new tanks showed high levels of acceptability amongst the community. other three studies looked at the effectiveness of environmental cleanup campaigns in combination with dengue education and awareness activities. six studies evaluated the use of the copepod Mesocyclops as a biological control agent in water containers. the study found that the percent of containers positive for larvae went from around 38% to close to 0%, mosquito landing numbers went from around 1 to close to 0, and the percentage of children screened who were dengue sero positive went from 13.5% to 0%. cost per person per year of the original program was estimated at $US2, with a marginal cost of expansion of 20c. the average cost of the program was calculated to be 61c per person per year (equivalent to a total cost of $6,134 annually) in international dollars. one study evaluated the effectiveness of fogging or spraying of insecticide targeted at the adult vector44. two studies evaluated a combination of larviciding and spraying. the remaining study was not able to show any impact on larval indices. in the Philippines, introduction of biological agents (dragon-fly nymphs and fish) to the most productive water containers was compared to a blanket approach where all containers were targeted. in the Philippines, the targeted vector control program had lower implementation costs ($4.47 per year per household covered) than the non-targeted campaign. information extracted from each included study were grouped under the following headings for discussion: contextual factors, behavioural mechanisms, and program design. sixteen of the 26 studies included study sites in rural locations. four studies looked at effectiveness of control programs in urban settings. a health education and temephos larviciding program was more effective in epidemic than inter-epidemic years. butraporn et al. reported poor wastewater management and a lack of affordability of piped water in their study. the frequency of household visits by dengue program volunteers, household knowledge of dengue prevention and the practice of dengue control activities were less successful when not combined with health education and awareness building activities. the study found that disease knowledge was not correlated with uptake or correct use of the curtains79 and Butraporn et al.79. participants failed to see reductions in mosquito and dengue rates. community involvement was active in education, environmental and biological control programs. community involvement was active in the education, environmental and biological control programs. Nam61, Nam et al.61, and Kay et al.55 all report that community leaders mobilised the whole community to take high levels of ownership of the program. continuous community input is required into their intervention based around use of copepods and environmental clean up to prevent reinfestation with dengue. surveillance interventions six studies looked at different aspects of the functioning of dengue surveillance activities. one study evaluated a passive surveillance system in terms of its ongoing functioning for monitoring endemic dengue. three studies looked at active surveillance of suspected dengue cases. syndromic surveillance definitions were used to conduct community-based surveillance on a number of diseases, including \u2018haemorrhagic fever\u2019 (HF) only 33% of cases of HF had contacted a health facility, with 67% of them being treated at home. surveillance system also detected two clusters of HF reported in one commune. therawiwat et al.74 measured both knowledge and larval indicators. they showed a 90% reduction in larval indices by the end of the study. seven studies evaluated a dengue control program that included use of biological control agents. one study65 is a pilot study of the use of Larvitab (larvicidal bacteria) in a rural location in a rural location in Thailand. the intervention achieved a reduction in vector indices, reducing larval populations by over 97% 12 months post introduction of copepods. the studies also reported a reduction in dengue incidence and this was maintained with no project communes reporting local cases of disease since 2003. nets showed a significant reduction in adult vector indices53 and larval vector indices59 but were not able to show a reduction in dengue infections as measured by dengue serology. t al. estimated cost of an annual larviciding program in Cambodia at 11c per person covered. compared a program based on environmental cleanup with repeat insecticidal fogging in an urban setting in Indonesia. the targeted approach and the non-targeted approach were equally effective at reducing entomological indices (Breteau index) by 80% in Myanmar and the Philippines and 50% in Thailand. in the Philippines, the targeted intervention had higher implementation costs compared to the non-targeted campaign ($6.45 per year per household covered) four interventions were evaluated in both urban and rural settings. these included impregnated bed nets, larviciding introduction of Mesocyclops to water containers and community cleanup campaigns. similar levels of effectiveness were achieved in both settings except larviciding which appeared to be more effective in rural area. sixteen of the 26 studies included study sites in rural locations. these included health education, environmental vector control strategies and biological vector control strategies. four interventions were evaluated in both urban and rural settings. source reduction out-performed fogging at reducing larval numbers in both seasons. a health education and temephos larviciding program was more effective in epidemic than inter-epidemic years. butraporn et al. reported poor wastewater management and a lack of affordability of piped water. knowledge of dengue prevention and the practice of dengue control was less successful when not combined with health education and awareness building activities. vanlerberghe et al. found that disease knowledge was not correlated with uptake or correct use of the curtains79 and Butraporn et al.79. participants failed to see reductions in mosquito and dengue rates in project communes. compared vector indices and dengue rates to those in non-project communes. Nam61 report that continuous community input is required into their intervention based around use of copepods and environmental clean up to prevent reinfestation with the dengue vector. Crabtree et al. report spin-off benefits to the community from participating in their intervention. Nam et al.'s evaluation of a biological and environmental control program in Viet Nam cites the importance of recycling as an economic activity as one of the reasons why clean up campaigns were successful in reducing entomological indices. the cost to participants of the intervention may facilitate or inhibit success of the program. the intervention included microcredit schemes for small businesses that were based around recycling and waste removal. communes in Viet Nam which received a rollout of their biological, environmental and educational intervention without support from a technical program team achieved lower reductions in entomological and epidemiological indices than the original project sites. however, there was tension between the village health volunteers used in their surveillance system and official health staff. final is a measure of clinical infection with dengue virus. the studies varied in size from 61 to 6341 households and 1163 to 2.9 million people. sensitivity analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each individual study. the meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the Breteau index. the forest plot shows homogeneity between studies (Figure 3) and the sensitivity analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each individual study. dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in mosquito bite rate. dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in mosquito bite rate. dengue control interventions led to a non-significant reduction in dengue haemorrhagic fever. the results of the meta-analysis showed that overall, the interventions included in this review were able to show a statistically significant impact on larval indices. effectiveness does not appear to vary by country or urban/rural context. only three studies56, 66, 72 included in the meta-analysis reported data on both larval and dengue outcomes. all showed consistency in the direction of the effect across outcomes, but all showed a bigger reduction in larval indices than number of dengue infections. interventions based on health education, environmental and biological vector control appear to be effective, low cost, well accepted, and sustainable in both urban and rural settings. single study comparing environmental clean-up with repeat fogging found that environmental cleanup was more effective at reducing mosquito numbers than the chemical control program. nine systematic reviews that were identified were also excluded. these focused on either a geographical region outside of the scope of this review(either China, Hong Kong and/or North America), the use of pharmaceutical or clinical interventions (vaccines and lab assays for clinical diagnosis) or the prevention of nosocomial (as opposed to community) transmission. 66 studies 55\u201358, 61, 62 included the use of copepods in their intervention. all control tools were locally produced including the copepods. the cost to participants may facilitate or inhibit success of the program. in use or correct use of impregnated curtains over their study to less than 50%. 100% of households found impregnated bed nets simple, convenient and comfortable to use. technical support states that a long-term version of their program would need support from authorities not just volunteers. study included household index, container index, Breteau index, larval population number, larval density index, the mosquito biting rate and the number of cases of dengue infection. the first five outcome measures measure Aedes aegypti larval populations in a number of settings. container index Six studies measured container index as an outcome measure. the meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the container index. the forest plot shows homogeneity between studies. as there were only two studies, a leave one out sensitivity analysis was not performed. dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in dengue haemorrhagic fever. the meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in the infection rate. the study by Crabtree et al.48 trialled an environmental cleanup intervention. it is a small, short, low quality study that is weakened by its inappropriate choice of control area. each reported problems with the sustainability of the intervention. a wide range of vector control interventions have been evaluated. these include chemical, biological and environmental methods of control. the majority of this evidence relies on entomological indices to evaluate programs. results for interventions targeted at SARS The search strategy identified 854 potentially relevant titles, of which 110 were shortlisted. 96 original references were excluded, narrative reviews with no original data, cross-sectional KAP surveys and model-based studies. the study was conducted in a tertiary hospital setting where there were well-established reporting hierarchies and electronic documentation of staff sick leave. the study focuses on the use of staff electronic medical records for early detection of outbreaks of febrile illness rather than solely to prevent nosocomial transmission. the authors conclude that such a system is practical and likely to be sensitive in this setting should appropriate indicators be chosen. this may lead to many false alarms and ultimately to outbreak \u201cfatigue\u201d whereby people fail to respond to early warning signals. the authors also note that surveillance is time-consuming and resource intensive. a single study from Viet Nam75 is a risk factor analysis for SARS transmission in contacts of SARS cases in Viet Nam. the study looked at the effectiveness of masks in preventing transmission of SARS from index cases to known contacts. Ooi et al. gives useful information about the public and individual response to the isolation and quarantine policy. the study indicates substantial resources were directed toward quarantined individuals. the study did not provide contextual information about why people did not wear masks. 95% of participants reported never wearing a mask. the study focuses on the use of staff electronic medical records for early detection of outbreaks of febrile illness. authors conclude that such a system is practical and likely to be sensitive in this setting should appropriate indicators be

preventing transmission of SARS from index cases to known contacts. 95% of contacts reported never wearing a mask, so no conclusions could be drawn about their effectiveness. study shows stigmatisation of quarantined individuals was reported. those quarantined were generally agreeable to being confined at home. the response was less positive to potential confinement in an institution. several outbreaks of avian influenza have been recorded in a number of SE Asian countries from 2004 to 2008. eleven studies were critically appraised and nine studies were included in the review. study by manabe et al. looked at how educational interventions in an intervention and control village influenced awareness relating to H5N1 and accessibility of healthcare. there were some differences in the intervention and control groups and also differences in participants pre- and post-intervention in the intervention commune. the study covered all countries covered by the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) the final three studies conducted in Indonesia relate to the same program of participatory epidemiology for the surveillance, prevention and control of HPAI in backyard poultry. the program was successful in training up a number of master trainers. it was operational in 76% (341) districts in Indonesia, 27/33 provinces. infection status of villages was determined as \u2018infected with HPAI\u2019. the study by Samaan et al. used rumour surveillance to analyse rumours generated by the media and email. rumours were followed up by email or telephone request to the relevant WHO country office to investigate their veracity. the authors conclude that this type of surveillance was successful in informing public health action. a greater proportion of participants reported receiving information from a health care worker or a friend after the intervention. a greater proportion of participants reported receiving information from a health care worker or a friend after the intervention, and more people were likely to seek early access to healthcare. several studies reported changing behaviours and customs was difficult,33, 42, 60, 78 particularly for residents of a rural area with a one-time educational intervention. the PDSR program in Indonesia had very positive impacts on revitalising veterinary services in Indonesia. the PDSR program in Indonesia has been very successful in training surveillance officers and detecting HPAI in backyard poultry. results from the surveillance interventions in Cambodia were equivocal because of several constraints.

positive impacts on revitalising veterinary services in Indonesia. the PDSR program in Indonesia has been very successful in training surveillance officers. it has also added value to existing veterinary health services in Indonesia. results from the surveillance interventions in Cambodia were equivocal. in recent years, the WHO has taken the initiative to develop a regional strategy for the elimination of human rabies transmitted by dogs. rabies control activities in a number of SE Asian countries are now government-driven with the involvement of government officials, health workers and community members. the use of effective dog control programs for dog rabies elimination has become rarer in developing countries. none of the studies evaluated the cost benefits and cost-effectiveness of rabies control interventions. canine vaccination has been shown to be a comparatively inexpensive and ethical way to control the disease in animals. study by Ozawa et al. presented trace back systems in several Asian countries. no evaluations of surveillance initiatives post the 1999 outbreak. the importance of Nipah virus as a newly emerging viral disease in the SE Asian region cannot be understated. the disease was eradicated from pigs in Malaysia, but its natural history suggests there is an on-going need for preparedness. GP sentinel surveillance was used to assess suspected cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever in a timely fashion for those that do access healthcare. it is unlikely that this approach will be applicable in a rural setting where people are less likely to go to a doctor. dengue vector, Aedes aegypti responds to control via a variety of methods. successful programs are fairly homogenous in the extent to which they are able to reduce larval indices over short time periods (less than two years) this finding concurs with the results of earlier systematic reviews that have looked at the effectiveness of dengue vector control interventions on reducing entomological indicators. local elimination of the vector and in reducing cases of dengue infection over sustained periods of time (10 years) copepods (natural predators of mosquito larvae) were introduced into water containers to reduce larvae numbers. they can be locally produced, low cost and have a higher level of acceptability as compared to Temephos. a systematic review of the functioning of vector control operations found limitations to current programs including a lack of personnel, expertise and budgets, difficulties engaging communities and almost no monitoring and evaluation. there is an urgent need for evidence on how findings for successful interventions can be better translated into effective practice. the highest quality evidence was undertaken in Viet Nam which has a fairly hierarchical culture. there was only limited evidence for the sustainability of interventions. factors that promoted sustainability included broad community involvement across different levels. studies with successful rabies control programs required coordination and cooperation among government and provincial services. most Southeast Asian countries are able to administer PET through rabies treatment centres, hospitals and clinics similar to those discussed in the paper by Kamoltham. reduction in human deaths due to increased uptake of the PET for rabies has also been documented in other Asian countries. however, the use of effective dog control programs for dog rabies elimination has become rarer in developing countries. a trace-back study identified Nipah virus as the causative agent. the lack of an established early warning system incorporated some form of ongoing monitoring of herd health hampered the prompt identification and control of the outbreak. our review found some evidence of proposed long-term sustainable prevention and control measures. new guidelines proposed to restructure the industry in line with designated pig farming areas and good animal husbandry concepts were to be implemented in each State. six studies looked at dengue surveillance at a number of levels. from community level to reporting to the provincial health services. a considerable proportion of people with symptoms consistent with dengue haemorrhagic fever do not access healthcare. reliance on larval or vector indices as primary outcome measures poses a limitation in terms of evaluating the impact of these strategies on dengue control. short duration of follow-up also means results can be confounded by seasonal and epidemic trends in vector populations and dengue incidence. trials of insecticide treated curtains indicate that this intervention is unlikely to be sustainable for a number of reasons, including poor use and maintenance of the curtains. control interventions based around biological, environmental and education components can maintain their effectiveness in reducing entomological indices to the point of local elimination of the vector. targeted interventions appear to offer comparable levels of effectiveness but at a lower cost. there are few studies that have tried to replicate findings from successful programs. there is an urgent need for evidence on how findings can be better translated into effective practice. high levels of community engagement include use of multiple methods of communication and education, repetition of education and awareness activities (rather than one-off sessions), engagement of community members at all stages of interventions; planning, delivery and evaluation. high levels of community ownership and responsibility for ongoing control activities also have spin off benefits for the community not related to dengue control. some interventions are low cost per person covered but the total cost may still be large. it would be worth exploring mechanisms to offset these costs as was done in the Viet Namese studies. study focused on contact tracing and quarantine protocols. but the quality of the study was poor and the results were of limited value. we did not find other studies reviewing other prevention measures. four of the five studies included were from Singapore, considered an \u201ceconomically advanced country\u201d with high GDP and level of education. a significant proportion of its public are proficient with information technology. the challenges with implementing surveillance of SARS in other Southeast Asian countries with less capable national agencies and healthcare institutions will be to engage with community-level healthcare workers and clinics. the study in Cambodia by Desvaux et al. has been the only one to present information on surveillance of commercial poultry and duck farms. the majority of visits were scheduled or \u2018active\u2019 surveillance (87%) as opposed to passive surveillance (13%). an internet rumour based surveillance system may be limited in its applicability. it depends highly on the level of engagement of local public health professionals. the prevention and control interventions in the PDSR program in Indonesia had limited success in controlling and eliminating HPAI. a single study by Escudero et al. of work-place surveillance within a hospital in Singapore was tested within a very structured work context. it is unclear whether this system would work in a more loosely structured work environment. the absence of electronic systems would also increase the labour resources required for such a system. a quarter of all SARS cases had been on quarantine orders prior to diagnosis. the study by Tuan is underpowered to detect any beneficial impact from using this intervention. no conclusions about the effectiveness of this intervention can be drawn. the challenges with implementing surveillance of SARS in other Southeast Asian countries will be to engage with community-level healthcare workers and clinics to implement some form of symptomatic or sentinel non-confirmatory surveillance system. the success of quarantine and home isolation measures in Singapore was in part due to the capability of the Singaporean government to commit significant financial resources to enforce this policy. the majority of visits were scheduled or 'active' surveillance (87%) but were more effective in detecting disease. surveillance also identified sources of infection (traders, unsafe disposal of carcasses and contaminated vehicles) the prevention and control interventions in the PDSR program in Indonesia had limited success in controlling and eliminating HPAI. veterinary officers have no legal mandate to enforce culling or movement restrictions of dead or infected poultry. in the absence of financial compensation for loss of livelihood, farmers are under no obligation to report mortality or sickness in animals. interventions tended to have been evaluated as research or pilot projects rather than as ongoing activities. absence of evidence for an intervention should not be interpreted as ineffective or less effective in specific contexts, rather there is no available published evidence. the concept of farm-gate biosecurity and herd health monitoring was discussed at the OIE/DVS meeting. there has not been any progress on recommendations set out at the meeting. all evidence on control activities has been in response to the outbreak. canine vaccination appears to be the most promising strategy for control. but investment in education is essential for a successful vaccination campaign. there has not been any progress on recommendations set out at the meeting. reducing vector numbers and can be used in both urban and rural areas. it is often supplemented with the use of either biological (such as copepods) or chemical (such as Temephos) larvicidal agents. the latter is reported as less acceptable due to problems with smell and taste. Surveillance in the backyard poultry sector has been successful in identifying HPAI in backyard poultry flocks. but evidence on the evaluation of these programs was not always identified. successful educational campaigns have not always translated into behavior modification and change. transmission of SARS in countries within the geographical scope of this review was mainly within the hospital setting. a further limitation is that the review only included studies with empirical data and therefore, at least for some of the diseases, this resulted in a small number of included studies. some \u201ctop-down\u201d government-driven initiatives may include local level community involvement and engagement in concert with the centrally coordinated response. a number of general recommendations relate to all five emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases included in the review, as well as recommendations specific to each disease. based prevention and control strategies are more effective if they have access to central coordination and support. linkage between veterinary and public health surveillance systems improves timely detection of outbreaks. a cross-regional plan of trace back systems makes sense as much as local and national systems to track the movement of pigs. pig farming industry should be managed differently including policies and protocols for sound farm management practices. environmental vector control and education without biological agents are also effective at reducing larval and mosquito indices. the use of chemical larvicides in water supplies is less well tolerated by communities than biological control agents. the use of impregnated curtains is not sustainable. successful implementation of contact tracing and isolation requires good organization, good communication and high levels of public support. a multi-country rumour surveillance system based on web sources was successful at identifying outbreaks in a low cost and timely manner. more successful programs offer multiple opportunities for people to engage and access the program. education and awareness programs should be designed and evaluated against models of behaviour change to facilitate extrapolation of findings to other contexts. more evidence is needed from a wider range of countries, particularly resource-constrained settings with less well developed infrastructure. evaluations need longer follow-up periods to control for seasonality. they should also provide data on the cost and sustainability of programs. researchers should provide more comprehensive descriptions of the community engagement strategies and activities used. linkage of animal and human health systems for detection and control of disease is essential for zoonotic infectious diseases as animals represent the main reservoir of infection. only limited evidence for programs based on the framework of \u2018One Health\u2019. canine vaccination without incentives/enforcement is not as effective in achieving good coverage of vaccination. Vaccination coverage may increase if financial compensation for destroyed animals was offered. improved communication between public health and veterinary systems would make it easier to monitor vaccination. dengue vector is amenable to short term control via a variety of vector control methods. interventions using copepods, environmental clean-up and education are effective at reducing larval indices, mosquito indices and incidence of dengue to the point of local elimination. SARS Passive surveillance in healthcare workers can be used to detect outbreaks of febrile illness. cost and timeliness of the system will depend on the extent to which staff medical records are electronic. contact tracing and large scale isolation and quarantine is effective in reducing time to isolation of suspected cases. linkage between veterinary and public health surveillance systems improves timely detection of outbreaks. higher levels of effectiveness are achieved where the community is involved in all stages of the program. the use of schools is a good channel as long as school children are fully engaged in the program. a cross-regional plan of trace back systems makes sense as much as local and national systems to track the movement of pigs. the strategy is low cost and sustainable. environmental vector control and larviciding of breeding habitats is effective at reducing larval indices, incidence of dengue and dengue morbidity in both urban and rural areas. the use of chemical larvicides in water supplies is less well tolerated by communities than biological control agents. a multi-country rumour surveillance system based on web sources was successful at identifying outbreaks in a low cost and timely manner. educational programs are successful at increasing awareness and knowledge about HPAI but have a lower impact at improving basic hygiene and risky poultry practices. evaluations of successful prevention and control interventions require replicating in other countries to test the generalisability of findings across different social, cultural and geographic contexts. more evidence is needed from a wider range of countries, particularly resource-constrained settings with less well developed infrastructure. evaluations should report data on dengue incidence and dengue mortality. they should also provide data on the cost and sustainability of programs. researchers should provide more comprehensive descriptions of community engagement strategies. there is a need for translational research to look at how findings from successful interventions can be translated into effective practice. rabies Long term evaluations of established rabies surveillance systems are needed that report both process and outcome measures. researchers should provide more comprehensive descriptions of the community engagement strategies and activities used. a description of the role of the research team in projects under evaluation would also be useful to understand how this might impact the success of interventions offered via routine dengue programs.
