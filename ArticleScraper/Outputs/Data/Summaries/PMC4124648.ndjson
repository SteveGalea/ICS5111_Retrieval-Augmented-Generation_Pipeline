{"summary": "necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory disease of the intestine, often associated with sepsis and complicated by perforation, peritonitis, and death. the total annual estimated cost of caring for affected infants with NEC only in the united states ranges between $500 million and $1 billion. hyperactivation of TLR4 signaling affects epithelial injury and repair mechanisms. injury to the intestinal mucosa may depend on a variety of conditions typical of prematurity, including hypoxia. fetuses express elevated levels of TLR4 until the end of the gestation. this overexpression could be due to the role of TLR4 in regulating proliferation and differentiation of the intestinal epithelium during embryogenetic period. TLR4 induces proinflammatory cytokine via the NFB pathway. proinflammatory cytokine promotes epithelial injury. TLR4 signal may be induced directly by bacterial products. Hsp70 promotes CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and consequent degradation of TLR4. reduced activity of Hsp70 or hyperactivation of TLR disrupts this balance and induces NEC. an extracellular factor possibly affecting TLR4 signal is the epidermal growth factor. no specific microbe has been identified as determinant etiologic factor. many pathogens may simulate a picture of NEC in neonates. new molecular biology has provided opportunities to reexamine this unresolved problem. epithelial barrier The intestinal mucosa of the premature infant presents a persistent equilibrium state between injury and repair. it has been suggested that NEC is associated with a marked inhibition in both enterocyte migration and proliferation, making the host uniquely susceptible to further injury and finally to bacterial translocation. the activation of TLR4 inhibits enterocyte migration and leads to enterocyte apoptosis in mice model. inhibition of TLR4 signaling in the intestinal epithelium prevents NEC development. this overexpression could be due to the role of TLR4 in regulating proliferation and differentiation of the intestinal epithelium during embryogenetic period. possible therapeutic interventions on molecular mechanism inducing necrotizing enterocolitis. TLR4 induces proinflammatory cytokine via the NFB pathway. proinflammatory cytokine promotes epithelial injury. heat shock proteins, of which Hsp70 is a predominant member, are a family of intracellular proteins activated by a variety of stressors. they contribute to the delivery of target proteins to the ubiquitin-proteosome system for degradation through cochaperone molecules. Hsp70 promotes CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and consequent degradation of TLR4 [18] intestinal integrity restitution requires intercellular connectivity, mediated through small channels, namely, gap junctions, rich in connexin protein. i.e., INF) cause the internalization of connexin 43, thereby impairing intercellular connectivity and reducing the extent of intestinal restitution. the mainstay in the prevention and treatment of NEC remains a correct management of fluid intake, nutrition, prevention of infections, and adequate antibiotic therapy. new therapeutic approaches can be hypothesized on the basis of the most recent evidence in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms. gA, lysozyme, lactoferrin, oligosaccharides, nucleotides, cytokines, growth factors, and enzymes. a specific component to transfer in preterm formula has not been definitively identified. hypoargininemia is frequently observed in preterm neonates. short chain fatty acids (SCFA), derived from fermentation of undigested carbohydrates by intestinal microflora, have important effects on epithelial functions and maturation. despite potential therapeutic utility of SCFA in neonates at risk of NEC, no studies testing the efficacy of these molecules are available at the moment. a specific strain used in a population from a developed country may not be effective in neonates from other countries, who may have different environmental and genetic conditions. debate as to whether to give probiotics systematically to preterm infants is still ongoing. probiotics supplementation inhibits pathogenic colonization and produces anti-inflammatory effects Neonatal Intensive Care Units with higher rates of NEC are more likely to observe a benefit with probiotic supplementation Probiotics secrete lactic acid to lower local pH. probiotics communicate directly with pathogenic bacteria modulating their gene expression. human milk is able to promote maturation of gastrointestinal tract in preterm neonates. a specific component to transfer in preterm formula has not been definitively identified. hypoargininemia is frequently observed in preterm neonates. amniotic fluid promotes epithelial repair by inhibition of TLR4 signal. despite potential therapeutic utility of SCFA in neonates at risk of NEC, no studies testing the efficacy of these molecules are available at the moment. a specific strain used in a population from a developed country may not be effective in neonates from other countries, who may have different environmental and genetic conditions. however, there are no high levels of evidences to recommend the routine use of probiotics in order to decrease the incidence of NEC. despite larger clinical trials, there are no ongoing trials targeting a sample size that large. many drugs currently used in neonatal intensive care unit may modify microbiota composition (i.e., antibiotics, probiotics) and, thus, influence the efficacy of such intervention of microflora manipulation. no data are currently available for neonates with NEC. important limitations should be considered before hypothesize this therapeutic option. future studies should start from the central role of the epithelium, innate immunity, and microbiota."}
