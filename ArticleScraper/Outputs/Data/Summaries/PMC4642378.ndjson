{"summary": "in 2011, the world health organization (WHO) themed its annual day to address this issue with the slogan \u201cNo action today, no cure tomorrow\u201d. the actions included providing education to achieve effective antibiotic use. antibiotic misuse is associated with the emergence and selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. social media platforms are being widely used for health promotion advocates. they have unique characteristics for sharing open access information. they have been used to raise awareness for obesity, diabetes, and adolescent dating violence [20]. a decrease in antibiotic prescriptions was observed in France between 2002 and 2007 compared with the preintervention period (2000-2002), with the largest reduction observed in children [22]. a 36% reduction in antibiotic prescriptions was also observed in Belgium from 1999-2000 to 2006-2007 [21]. formoso et al [9] reported the effectiveness of a low-cost media campaign on antibiotic use in an italian province. the intervention materials included visual aids, such as posters, brochures, and advertisements. the key messages of the campaign were codesigned by a physician practicing in the intervention area. the impact of the e-Bug project is not clear because no evaluation of its implementation and impact on behavioral changes in targeted groups was ever performed. e-Bug project had a total of 17,391 visitors on may 2015. the site had 76 visitors in total. 37% of the total population of the CC states consists of nonnational expatriates. it is important to consider cultural differences and not to neglect this segment. the self-prescription of antibiotics is strongly associated with the availability of antibiotics over-the-counter. research into the correlation between social media-based awareness campaigns and behavior change is minimal because it is a new avenue in public health awareness. research into the correlation between social media-based awareness campaigns and behavior change is minimal because it is a new avenue in public health awareness. establishing a social media-based campaign may be far cheaper than traditional media-based campaigns. the key advantage of social media is the possibility to measure and track impressions and responses to online posts. the vast majority of antibiotic awareness campaigns launched in high-income countries between 1990 and 2007 were conducted over a period of more than 1 year [6] a hashtag is a keyword preceded by a hash sign (#) that is used to identify and categorize messages on a specific topic. this can give the topic a longer lifespan in social media [49,50]. Keeping the audience engaged and interested in the topic is another important consideration. the number of active users in the arab world reached 3,766,160 individuals as of March 2013, with an estimated 10,832,000 tweets per day. Saudi Arabia has the highest number of active Twitter users in the arab world, with 1.9 million individuals. the video-sharing website YouTube is also a popular media platform in the GCC. the figures were obtained from YouTube channels on November 15, 2013. one model was noticed in many campaigns that used comedy talk shows with large audience as a platform to deliver the messages. the messages have traveled far and wide, attracting a large number of viewers. the incidence rate of MERS-CoV has declined [56] with the multi-faceted intervention. social media platforms may have been used to create online presence to endorse awareness messages delivered locally on traditional media. a simple analysis of 147 selected tweets with the Arabic superbug hashtag resulted in approximately 4100 retweets between July and November 2013. we created a whiteboard animation with a voiceover video that discussed the importance of antibiotics, how superbugs are created, and the spread of superbugs in the GCC. video was viewed more than 3000 times in only 2 weeks. the content generated for our pilot campaign was primarily dependent on our existing knowledge of antibiotic misuse in Saudi Arabia and neighboring states. social media can also enhance awareness campaigns delivered in traditional media channels. social media\u2013based messages can also have short life span, which might limit the effect and reach of key awareness messages. it is important to consider the cultural demographic diversity, which could limit the reach of key awareness messages. a decrease in antibiotic prescriptions was observed in France between 2002 and 2007 compared with the preintervention period (2000-2002), with the largest reduction observed in children. a 36% reduction in antibiotic prescriptions was also observed in Belgium from 1999-2000 to 2006-2007. the e-Bug project is an example of an innovative approach to raise awareness about microbes and infection prevention. the aim of the project is to disseminate educational materials about microbes (both beneficial and pathogenic) to junior and senior school students across Europe. the project relies on website-based gaming and entertainment-based lessons. awareness messages that display local surveillance data or amount of antibiotics locally misused may be useful. sharing real-life medical experiences may be useful and may help the audience identify with those affected. delivering known messages to the target audience might result in a loss of interest. the self-prescription of antibiotics is strongly associated with the availability of antibiotics over-the-counter. this factor is strongly associated with the availability of antibiotics over-the-counter. research into the correlation between social media-based awareness campaigns and behavior change is minimal because it is a new avenue in public health awareness. campaigns aimed at raising awareness of antibiotic use sourced funding from different sectors, including the pharmaceutical industry. the cost of running a traditional mass media campaign to promote antibiotic use in the community can be very expensive. the cost of running a traditional mass media campaign to promote prudent antibiotic use in the community can be very expensive. the vast majority of antibiotic awareness campaigns launched in high-income countries between 1990 and 2007 were conducted over a period of more than 1 year [6] other campaigns are seasonal and have a long-term sustainable plan. however, the \u201cGet Smart Colorado\u201d campaign, which lasted for only 4 months, successfully showed a 3.8% net reduction in antibiotic dispensing at retail pharmacies. users in the GCC states represent approximately 22% (12 million) of the total Facebook users in the Arab world [52] for the microblogging website Twitter, the number of active users in the Arab world reached 3,766,160 individuals as of March 2013, with an estimated 10,832,000 tweets per day. the

between July and November 2013. the number of retweets that we received from our superbugs hashtag correlated with the number of YouTube views. we observed 2 large peaks in viewing rates within the first 2 weeks of the video being released. we believe the first was due to our successful Twitter activities. it is possible that the video was picked up by another group and spread on Twitter again. diverse ethnic groups and socioeconomic status of people in the Gulf states should also be considered in future campaigns. social media platforms seem to be a valuable platform for delivering awareness messages."}
