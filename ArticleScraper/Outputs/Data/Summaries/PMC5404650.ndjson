{"summary": "new TB vaccines are developed via two basic ways. the first aims to replace the current BCG with recombinant BCG4 or genetically attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis. the second intends to create better TB vaccines by developing subunit vaccines. several boosting vaccines have entered early clinical trials. this includes modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) that expresses the mycobacterial protective antigen Ag85A (designated as MVA85A) 17,18 However, it failed to generate efficacy against M.tb infection or disease based on a recent clinical trial in healthy adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1. we then detected the IFN-+CD4+ T cells. the results showed that they were the most abundant in the spleen of mice with BCG priming and VSV-846-boosting vaccination. however, the IFN-+CD8+ T cells in the VSV-846-boosting group did not increase compared with BCG or VSV-846-boosting vaccination. immunized mice were challenged with 107 colony-forming unit (CFU) BCG in the aerosol route. the pathology of lung tissues was analyzed. sections from the mock PBS-immunized mice were exhibited. the percentage of single-positive IFN-, IL-2, or TNF- CD4+ T producer did not show a significant difference in the presence or absence of VSV-846 boosting among these groups. the total double-positive polyfunctional (IL-2+IFN-+, TNF-+IL-2+ and TNF-+ IFN-+) CD4 T cells (1.09%) were considerably higher after VSV-846 boosting than those after BCG or VSV-846 single immunization the proportion of IL-2+IFN-+ CD 4 T cells with VSV-846 boosting was markedly increased to 62%, which was higher than the percentage in BCG (50%) or VSV-846single immunization (47%; Fig. 4B). the total percentage of polyfunctional CD4 T cells, including double- and triple-positive CD4 T cells with VSV-846 boosting, was 72%, which was higher than that of the cells with BCG immunization ( the IFN-+CD8+ T cells in the VSV-846-boosting group did not increase compared with BCG or VSV-846 immunization by flow cytometry. our results indicated that the viral vaccine VSV-846 might enhance strong cellular immunity after BCG priming. splenocytes of immunized mice (n = 6 per group) were isolated at week 18. mice immunized with VSV-846, BCG priming/VSV-846 boosting, and BCG showed significantly reduced inflammation and intact alveolar morphology. the vaccination with VSV-846 boosting efficiently controlled the bacterial growth by 199.5-fold lower than the mock PBS vaccination. double-positive polyfunctional (IL-2+IFN-+, TNF-+IL-2+ and TNF-+ IFN-+) CD4 T cells were significantly higher after VSV-846 boosting than those after BCG or VSV-846 single immunization. the percentage of triple-positive TNF-+IL-2+ IFN-+ CD4 T cells induced with BCG or BCG priming/VSV-846 boosting was low compared with those of single- or double-positive the polyfunctional T cells might perform an important function in the long-term protection against mycobacterium infection. the vector can induce robust humoral and cell-mediated Th1 immunity with a single dose in the absence of additional adjuvants. this is considered crucial in the defense against mycobacterium infection. the bacterial load in the lung tissues with VSV-846 boosting decreased by 199.5-fold compared with that of mock PBS-immunized mice 24 weeks after the challenge. introducing other heterologous vaccines as boosters is one of the approaches to induce efficient cellular immunity by enhancing the apparent waning immunological memory. our results indicated that heterologous boosting with VSV-846 after BCG immunization enhanced the cellular immune responses and protection against mycobacterium infection. mice were first intramuscularly immunized with a single dose of 1 106 CFU BCG and then intranasally inoculated with 106 PFU VSV-846. the group of mice was either intramuscularly immunized with 1 106 CFU BCG or intranasally inoculated with 106 PFU VSV-846 once. recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cells were infected with 10 multiplicity of infection recombinant vaccinia virus. recombinant virus was stored at 80 \u00b0C until use. IFN- ELISA Splenocytes were isolated from immunized mice at week 18. splenocytes were isolated at week 18 and cultured the under stimulation of TFP846 protein with a final concentration of 10 g/mL at 37 \u00b0C for 60 h. after centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 g, the cells were then washed, fixed, and permeabilized using a commercially available Cytofix/Cytoperm kit. mice were immunized with 1 106 CFU BCG and then intranasally inoculated with 106 PFU VSV-846 once. mice were either intramuscularly immunized with a single dose of 1 106 CFU BCG or intranasally inoculated with 106 PFU VSV-846 once. vaccinia virus-infected cells were infected with 10 multiplicity of infection recombinant vaccinia virus. supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection, sieved through a 0.22-m-pore filter to remove vaccinia virus. recombinant virus was stored at 80 \u00b0C until use. biotinylated anti-IFN- mAb was added to the plates. the color was developed by an AP colorimetric substrate. an immunospot analyzer (Cellular Technology) was used to enumerate spots. cells were co-stained with perCP-Cy5.5-anti-mouse CD4 (Biolegend), FITC-anti-mouse IFN- (Biolegend), PE-anti-mouse IL-2 (Biolegend), and APC-Cy7-anti-mouse TNF- (Biolegend). the stained cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer with FACSDiva software."}
