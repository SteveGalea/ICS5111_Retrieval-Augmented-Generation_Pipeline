{"summary": "the effectiveness of such masks for excluding pathogens and pollutants is dependent on the intrinsic ability of the masks to resist penetration by airborne contaminants. the results demonstrate >99.7% efficiency of each test mask configuration for exclusion of influenza A virus, rhinovirus 14 and S. aureus and >99.3% efficiency for paraffin oil and sodium chloride. environmental pollutants are high in geographical areas with high morbidity and mortality associated with these pollutants. of particular concern is fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter 2.5 m (referred to as PM2.5) that originates from coal-fired power plants and traffic. the potential for infection with airborne pathogens and for exposure to such airborne particulates poses a threat to global public health. Smart Mask Large size (hereafter called the \u201ctest mask\u201d) incorporates these features that are designed for the purpose of enhancing wearer comfort (11) it is important that effectiveness of personal protective devices be measured against a variety of relevant pathogens and pollutants. outer layer constructed of hydrophobic non-woven polypropylene that prevents external moisture from entering the mask material. layers of melt-blown non-woven polypropylene capture oil and non-oil based particles through four key mechanisms. outer layer is a modacrylic support layer that provides rigidity and adds thickness to the mask. a downstream vacuum was turned on to create an air flow (28.3 L/min) through the mask. the downstream vacuum pump was left on for another minute to pull residual aerosol from the chambers into the one-stage Andersen sampler. a ten-fold dilution series of the samples collected was prepared in a dilution medium. bacterial filtration efficiency test compared upstream bacterial control counts to downstream counts. suspension of bacteriophage 174 was aerosolized using a six-jet Collison nebulizer and delivered to the face mask (N=5 replicate measurements) test masks were evaluated using a modified Phoenix SG-20 aerosol generator with detection using a photometer. three replicates of the mask were evaluated under \u201cas received\u201d and \u201csimulated wearing\u201d conditions per the Standard (15). the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, USA) test mask is an N95-rated (16) respiratory face mask. the outer layer is constructed of hydrophobic non-woven polypropylene that prevents external moisture from entering the mask material. the innermost layer is another hydrophobic non-woven polypropylene layer which minimizes moisture within the mask from entering the mask material. the virus filtration efficiency test was performed in triplicate (N=3) for each run, a six-jet nebulizer was filled with a measured amount of virus suspended in 0.1 Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) the virus was aerosolized and delivered into the upstream chamber using high-pressure air. downstream vacuum was turned on to create an air flow (28.3 L/min) through the mask that was intended to mimic human breathing (17). RNA was extracted using a Qiagen QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini kit. the forward primer was 5\u2019-GAC CRA TCC TGT CAC CTC TGA C, the reverse primer was 5\u2019-AGG GCA TTY TGG ACA AAC GTC TAA. for rhinovirus 14, the forward primer was 5\u2019-GAG GTG GTG TGT GTG CTA CT and the reverse primer was 5\u2019-GAC TTG GTT GTT G a suspension of bacteriophage 174 was aerosolized using a six-jet Collison nebulizer. the suspension was delivered to the face mask (N=5 replicate measurements) at a constant flow rate (28.3 L/min) the aerosolized droplets were drawn through a six-stage Andersen sampler for collection. efficiencies of various configurations of the test mask were determined empirically per the requirements of the relevant Standards (12-15) the ability of the test mask to provide user protection against airborne pathogenic viruses was assessed using the human respiratory viruses, influenza A (H1N1) virus and rhinovirus 14 per ASTM F2101-14 (12) the viruses evaluated differ with respect to size and envelope status. test mask configuration* Influenza A (H1N1) virus (Strain A/PR/8/34) Rhinovirus Type 14 (Strain 1059) % Filtration by infectivity % Filtration by infectivity % Filtration by RT-PCR 1 99.7%0.5% 100%0.0% 99.6%0.5% 97.0%5.2% 2 99.9%0.1% 99.3%1.0% 99.8%0.2% 99.5%0.9% 3 99.6%0.5% 98.9% 99.5% of microbial agents was excluded by the test mask. no statistically significant differences were observed when these data were analyzed by surrogate pathogen. conditioning of mask per EN149 % Penetration (mean SD, N=3) Sodium chloride (solid) Paraffin oil (liquid) * significantly different from the \u201cas received\u201d value by two-tailed t-test. SD, standard deviation. based on RT-PCR, no statistically significant differences were observed when these data were analyzed by either influenza virus or rhinovirus for a given mask configuration, or by mask configuration for either of the viruses. test mask without micro Ventilator for filtration of Staphylococcus aureus and bacteriophage 174. no statistically significant differences were observed when these data were analyzed. a statistically significant difference between \u201cas received\u201d and \u201csimulated wearing\u201d testing was identified for both sodium chloride and paraffin oil (P0.05) the requirements for the Standard were met, including penetration limits as well as breathing resistance (a measure of comfort); data not shown. a randomised clinical trial found that wearing this test mask without Micro Ventilator increased the end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) and fractional concentration of inspired CO2 (FICO2) compared to children without masks at rest and during brisk walking. wearing the mask with operational Micro Ventilator brought FICO2 levels for both activities closer to baseline levels obtained in children not wearing the mask. the test mask was awarded an N95 rating by NIOSH. testing for satisfaction includes evaluation of inhalation and exhalation resistance (16) the use of respiratory face masks with operational ventilation fans is therefore useful both from a comfort-enhancement perspective as well as for providing optimal filtration efficiency. the challenge was in the form of aerosol particles with MPS of 3.0 m. the particle size used was that stipulated in the relevant Standard (ASTM F2101) (12,13). the potential role of fine aerosols in transmission of a variety of viruses has been reviewed. the results confirm previous observations of the limited value of surgical masks for filtering fine aerosols containing infectious agents and particulates (31). the filtration efficiency studies performed on the test mask were based on methodologies described in the various international standards followed (i.e., ASTM F2101 and EN149:20001 + A1:2009). filtration efficiency of N95-rated face masks has not translated into significant differences in protection of healthcare workers in controlled studies (34-36) consumers use masks for prevention of exposure to infectious agents (during influenza, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV outbreaks) a face mask with a Smart Valve should allow unfiltered exhaled air to exit the mask. a controlled clinical study failed to reveal a significant difference in protection of healthcare workers using fit-tested vs. non-fit-tested N95 masks (42). a controlled clinical study failed to reveal a significant difference in protection of healthcare workers using fit-tested vs. non-fit-tested N95 masks (42). independent testing laboratories demonstrate >99.7% efficiency of the test mask for the protection of users from influenza A virus, rhinovirus 14 and S. aureus. surrogate particulates such as paraffin oil and sodium chloride should also be effective at excluding pollutants such as PM2.5 and allergens."}
