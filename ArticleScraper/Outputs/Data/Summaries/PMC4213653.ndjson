{"summary": "the emergence of new infectious diseases with high mortality often captures the public imagination. recent reports of MERS, Kyasanur forest disease virus and Ebola are three of the most recent reminders that this is a real risk. a number of recent zoonoses have been attributed to bat reservoirs. the introduction and subsequent transmission events may not be uniformly distributed across a large, well-mixed population. this approximation is best when the introduction events are rare and uniformly distributed across a large, well-mixed population. however, this is only an approximation. the simulations reveal that immunity in bridge communities can strongly diminish disease emergence. Suppose the cells of a toroidal lattice represent a host population. each cell is susceptible, infected or immune, after which infected cells recover and become immune. for low exposure rates, the emergence hazard increases linearly as the exposure rate increases. the spot where the emergence hazard switches from increasing to decreasing is called a \u2018turning point\u2019. emergence hazard switches from increasing to decreasing. emergence rate is proportional to the duration of immunity when epidemics are fast. the less connected and clustered the population, the more local herd immunity suppresses emergence. the greater the perimeter-to-area ratio of the bridge community for comparable gross introduction rates, the greater the emergence rate. local herd immunity evaporates as the duration of immunity shortens. the emergence hazard rate for emergence of infectious disease is influenced by population viscosity and immunity. we will use compartmental epidemic equations to augment a multi-type generalization of ARKB theory. subscripts 1 and 2 will refer to a bridge community and the larger general population. let m be the small probability that the pathogen adapts to be human-transmissible. we propose to estimate the emergence hazard rate along a single pathway using 3.2. the greater the rate of immigration of naive individuals into the bridge community, the greater the emergence hazard rate. for a fixed population size (N = / is constant), faster turnover of the bridge community increases the emergence rate. the greater the probability of exposure inducing immunity (r), the lower the emergence rate. f is the expected number of transmissions from a person in the bridge community to other people in the bridge community. a second value, g, indicates the frequency of parochial transmission outside the bridge community. strong population viscosity implies parochial transmission (f 1) in the bridge community. there is no back-transmission to the bridge community (g = 1). emergence becomes impossible for large 0. If contacts are completely proselyte (f = 0) then the emergence rate increases monotonously with the exposure rate. clustering between exposure and transmission mediated by immunity can suppress transmission. the ARKB theory of infectious disease emergence makes an important approximating assumption on the independence of introduction events. we have identified circumstances created by acquired immunity and contact-network clustering that can reduce emergence hazard rates relative to the predictions of ARKB theory. the longer the epidemic generation time for a given, the less lifelong immunity can suppress emergence. bridge populations may be identified as priority targets for preventive vaccination programmes, as this is certain to reduce transmission hazards. members of a bridge community are at greater risk from zoonotic reservoirs. changes that reduce the overall risk of the general population may increase the risk to the bridge community. bridge communities may offer some unique opportunities for prophylactic interventions."}
