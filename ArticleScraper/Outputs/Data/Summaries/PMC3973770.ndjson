{"summary": "FeLV was discovered among cats that lived in a cluster-household where several animals had developed lymphosarcoma. the virus is an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA retrovirus. cats are usually infected by direct contact with infected cats. Virus culture and purification Vero cells were used for FeLV culture. the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. the infection progressed until 8090% of the cells were floating or lightly attached to the T-75 flask (typically 10 days post-infection) the virus were harvested and purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation (3% sucrose) to clone genes encoding p27 in FeLV, two primers were designed and synthesized (Cosmogenetech, Korea) the transformants were grown at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani medium (Difco; Becton Dickinson and Company, USA) to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.70.8 by DU UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, USA) the cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 g 20 min at 4\u00b0C. the isolated protein was dialyzed at 4\u00b0C with 10 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.0) (Sigma-Aldrich) the protein concentration was measured by the method developed by Bradford [21]. hybridomas producing the antibodies of interest were selected and subcloned from a single cell using the limited dilution method. the hybridomas were used to produce ascitic fluid in the BALB/c mice. the immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified with a protein G-coupled Sepharose column. p27 mAb 8G7D1-gold conjugate was dispensed and immobilized to the test line zone of a nitrocellulose membrane (MDI, India) the gold solution was then dialyzed with 1 mM Borax (pH 9.0) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 h at 4\u00b0C. the pH of the gold solution was adjusted to 9.0 with 0.2 M K2CO3. the control line was expected to appear in all tests. if a red band appeared at the test line, the specimen contained FeLV antigen. PCR was performed with a commercially available FeLV Detection Kit. PPV was the proportion of true positive results among all positive samples. NPV was the proportion of true negative results among all negative samples. 282 sera samples from 155 household felines and 127 stray cats were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (USA) the viruses were harvested and purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation (3% sucrose) to clone genes encoding p27 in FeLV, two primers were designed and synthesized. the reverse primer was 5'-ctcgagcagaactttagtcatctctgtg-3' (the XhoI site is underlined) the gene insert in the pGEM-T vector was subcloned into a pET28a expression vector (Merk Millipore, USA) the transformants were grown at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani medium (Difco; Becton Dickinson and Company, USA) to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.70.8 by DU UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, USA recombinant protein was dialyzed at 4\u00b0C with 10 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.0) (Sigma-Aldrich) the isolated protein was dialyzed at 4\u00b0C with 10 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.0) and identified by SDS-PAGE analysis. sp2/0 myeloma cells were selected and subcloned from a single cell using the limited dilution method. the hybridomas were used to produce ascitic fluid in the BALB/c mice. the immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified with a protein G-coupled Sepharose column. anti-p27 mAb 8G7D1-gold conjugate was dispensed and immobilized to the test line zone of a nitrocellulose membrane (MDI, India) the gold solution was then dialyzed with 1 mM Borax (pH 9.0) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 h at 4\u00b0C. the pH of the gold solution was adjusted to 9.0 with 0.2 M K2CO3. the test strip was assembled and all pads were partially overlapped to enable migration of the sample solution along the test strip. the control line was expected to appear in all tests. a red band appeared at the test line, the specimen contained FeLV antigen. Sensitivity was expressed as the percentage (%) of positive test results obtained for all samples containing FeLV according to the PCR analysis. PPV was the proportion of true positive results among all positive samples. NPV was the proportion of true negative results among all negative samples. mAbs 2B2B2 and 2B3D1 bound strongly to rec. p27 but weakly with the purified virus. clones 8F8B5 and 8G7D1 had higher affinities. clones 8F8B5 and 8G7D1 had higher affinities. the detection threshold for rec. p27 was 2 ng/mL and 12.5 104 IU/mL for the virus. this is an excellent level of sensitivity and higher or comparable to previously reported ones. the cross-reaction test demonstrated that the RDT kit did not produce any false-positives to other feline infectious viruses including FIV, FPV, FCoV, and FCaV. a commercially available ELISA (SNAP FeLV Ag/FIV Ab Combo; Idexx Laboratories, USA) demonstrated that the purified rec. p27 had very strong antigenic activity (Fig. 2). Expression and purification of soluble p27 protein. hybridoma 1H8G10 reacted very strongly against rec. p27. however, this was problematic since the hybridoma produced ascitic fluid because it formed a solid tumor in the mouse. we also excluded hybridoma 3B5C2 due to the lower affinity of the antibody produced compared to that generated by 8F8B5 and 8G7D1. clinical assessment of the RDT A total of 282 feline specimens were simultaneously tested using the RDT kit. the RDT kit had a sensitivity of 95.2% (20/21) and a specificity of 98.5% (257/261; p 0.001) assuming that the PCR results were correct. these levels of accuracy were calculated as the number of positive or negative RDT results divided by the number of positive or negative PCR results. the mean concentration of FeLV p27 in infected feline serum from a cat suffering from persistent viremia was 4,800 ng/mL (60015,000 ng/mL) the RDT using 8F8B5 and 8G7D1 which had a detection limit of 2 ng/mL for rec. p27 and 12.5 104 IU/mL for the virus would be very useful for practical diagnosis. the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of current commercialized diagnostic the RDT can serve as a point-of-care testing tool because of its rapid assay time, ease of use, and no need for expert technicians. stray animals should be rapidly diagnosed and treated to prevent spread of FeLV infection among cat populations."}
