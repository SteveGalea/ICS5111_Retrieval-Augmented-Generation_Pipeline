{"summary": "in the united states, 1 in 15 (21 million) residents acquire these infections annually. 58% of food-borne illnesses are caused by noV, making these infections the leading identified causative agent of this significant public health problem. human noV are members of the family Caliciviridae. the overall structure of NoV Pro is that of a cysteine protease with a chymotrypsin-like fold and a catalytic triad consisting of histidine-30, glutamic acid-54, and cysteine-139 (22). peptides or inhibitors have indicated that the substrate residues P4, P2, P1\u2032 have substantial interactions with the protease during proteolysis (23\u201326) Peptides are named for the noV ORF1 cleavage site that they represent (e.g., NS2-3) designations for peptides that contained all wild-type (WT) sequences were given a subscript suffix (e.g., NS2-3WT) GII wild-type (WT) sequences represent the most common, continuous P7-P7\u2032 sequences observed in 75 GII.4 sequences from GenBank analyzed (31). the NS6-7WT sequence was found in 46/75 sequences examined. the NS6-7WT sequence was found in 46/75 sequences examined.

NS2-3 replaced the residues of WT NS6-7 from panel A. the NS2-3 cleavage is included for comparison. the NS2-3LATE peptide contained the NS6-7WT P4-P2\u2032 sequence. it had much lower enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km) than the NS2-3WT peptide. the overall enzyme efficiency of the NS2-3LATE peptide was comparable to that of the NS6-7WT peptide. a peptide was designed to incorporate only the NS2-3 P4-P1\u2032 residues into the NS6-7WT peptide (NS6-7EARLYP4-P1\u2032) this peptide retained the NS6-7 P2\u2032 glycine instead of the NS2-3 P2\u2032 proline. this peptide exhibited substantially enhanced cleavage efficiency compared to those of the NS6-7EARLY and NS2-3WT peptides. sequence alignment of P4-P2\u2032 residues from ORF1 cleavage sites from GI and GII reference strainsa Cleavage site Strain Amino acid at indicated position P4 P3 P2 P1\u2032 P2\u2032 NS2-3 GI Norwalk F H L Q * G P GI Chiba M H L Q * G P GI Chiba F Q M Q * G Q GI Southhampton F Q L Q * G K GII MD145 reference sequences used were GI Norwalk (NC_001959), GI Chiba (AB042808), GI Southampton (L07418), GII MD145 (AY032605), GII Camberwell (AF145896), and GII Hawaii (U07611). ORF1NS4-5EARLY and ORF1NS5-6EARLY constructs displayed self-cleavage patterns similar to those previously reported (17\u201319) two early cleavage events were observed that released mature Nterm and NTPase. a peptide containing the NS3-4 cleavage site displayed a 2-fold-greater noV pro enzyme efficiency than did a peptide containing the NS2-3 site (31). the ORF1NS2-3LATE construct showed altered kinetics that were consistent with the observations for the P7-P7\u2032 FRET peptides described above. the levels of mature Nterm and NTPase were significantly reduced over the time course. substitutions at one site that changed the processing efficiency for that site did not affect the processing kinetics at the other four (unaltered) sites (17\u201319) changes were expected to enhance the rate of cleavage between Pro and Pol relative to that of the WT polyprotein. within 45 min, mature Pol had accumulated to dramatically higher levels than were observed for ORF1WT over 8 h. sequence of NS2-3 was substituted for the P4-P2\u2032 core sequence at the NS4-5 (ORF1NS4-5EARLY) or the NS5-6 (ORF1NS5-6EARLY) cleavage site in separate constructs. as expected, the NS2-3 P4-P2\u2032 sequence enhanced the cleavage of the NS4-5 (p20/VPg) site. the early NS2-3 and NS3-4 sites were cleaved rapidly. the late NS4-5, NS5-6, and NS6-7 sites were cleaved poorly. the late NS6-7 P4-P2\u2032 residues decreased the cleavage efficiency at the NS2-3 cleavage site after substitution. a GI NS2-3 peptide was designed to incorporate a P3 glutamate instead of the wild-type P3 histidine (GI NS2-3P3-Glu) the GI NS2-3P3-Glu peptide displayed higher enzyme efficiency (4-fold) than the GI NS2-3WT peptide. incubation of the wild-type NS2-3 (NS2-3WT) peptide with noV Pro showed a much higher enzyme efficiency than incubation with the NS6-7WT peptide. the cleavage kinetics was drastically reduced to essentially that observed for the NS6-7WT peptide. ase activity at the GI NS2-3 cleavage site. kcat/Km (M1 s1) noV GII Pro GII NS2-3WT 17.28 1.99 109.2. the NS2-3LATE peptide contained the NS6-7WT P4-P2\u2032 sequence. the overall enzyme efficiency of the NS2-3LATE peptide was comparable to that of the NS6-7WT peptide, with kcat/Km values of 40 and 42 M1 s1 respectively. the overall enzyme efficiency of the NS2-3LATE peptide was comparable to that of the NS6-7WT peptide, with a greater than 20- a peptide was designed to incorporate only the NS6-7EARLYP4-P1\u2032 residues into the NS6-7EARLY peptide (NS6-7EARLYP4-P1\u2032) this peptide retained the NS6-7 P2\u2032 glycine instead of the NS2-3 P2\u2032 proline. this peptide exhibited substantially enhanced cleavage efficiency compared to those of the NS6-7EARLY and NS2-3WT peptides. sa Cleavage site Strain Amino acid at indicated position P4 P3 P2 P1 P1\u2032 P2\u2032 NS2-3 GI Norwalk F H L Q * G P GI Chiba M H L Q * G P GI Chiba M H L Q * G P GI Chiba F Q M Q * G Q GI Southhampton F Q L Q * G P NS4-5 GI Norwalk A V P E * G K GI Chiba self-processing order of noV ORF1 polyprotein can be changed by altering P4-P2\u2032 residues. GI noV ORF1 constructs were placed downstream from a T7 promoter. wild-type ORF1 (ORF1WT) showed self-cleavage patterns similar to those previously reported (17\u201319) two early cleavage events were observed that released mature Nterm and NTPase, which were prominent after only 30 min (Fig. 3A, lane 2). the ORF1NS2-3LATE construct contained the NS6-7 P4-P2\u2032 residues at its NS2-3 cleavage site. this change was expected to slow processing down at the NS2-3 site. levels of mature Nterm and NTPase were significantly reduced over time course. early P4-P2\u2032 residues replaced the P4-P2\u2032 residues of the late NS6-7 site. these changes were expected to enhance the rate of cleavage between Pro and Pol relative to that of the WT polyprotein. p114 (p20VPgProPol) precursor was present at substantially reduced levels. the NS2-3 P4-P2\u2032 sequence enhanced the cleavage of the NS4-5 (p20/VPg) site in the ORF1NS4-5EARLY construct. the resulting precursor product (VPgProPol) was readily detected after only 1 h, indicating that the NS4-5 site was cleaved very efficiently (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 to 4). early NS2-3 and NS3-4 sites were cleaved rapidly. late NS4-5, NS5-6, and NS6-7 sites were cleaved poorly. the late NS6-7 P4-P2\u2032 residues decreased the cleavage efficiency at the NS2-3 cleavage site after substitution. 48% of 75 GII.4 NS2-3 sequences examined from GenBank contain phenylalanine, while the remaining 52% contained tyrosine. a GI NS2-3 peptide was designed to incorporate a P3 glutamate instead of the wild-type P3 histidine (GI NS2-3P3-Glu) the peptide displayed higher enzyme efficiency (4-fold) than the GI NS2-3WT peptide. protease processing at human noV ORF1 cleavage sites is primarily regulated by the P4-P2\u2032 sequences. previous studies attempted to modulate NoV Pro processing efficiency through single amino acid substitutions (17\u201319, 41) a similar observation has been made for the related sapovirus. substitution of P2\u2032 aspartic acid resulted in a 3-fold increase in enzyme efficiency. glycine affords the widest range of main chain conformations due to the lack of a side chain. residues from the NS6-7 cleavage site (C) and the GII NS2-3 cleavage site (D) but with P5 and P2\u2032-to-P4\u2032 residues from the NS6-7 cleavage site (D) the figures were prepared using PyMOL (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC). the importance of the P3 amino acid surrounding noV cleavage sites has not been previously recognized in the literature. the imidazole side chain from a P3 histidine residue occupies a more shallow position in the P3 pocket due to the shorter and bulkier imidazole side chain. as a result, the histidine side chain is not predicted to interact with either lysine-162 (GI) or arginine-162 (GII) or the P1 glutamine side chain. these models provide a possible explanation for why the enzyme-transition state complex may be less stable in the coronavirus protease suggested the positively charged side chain from a variant P3 arginine residue would form a favorable electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged side chain of glutamic acid-166. this interaction was proposed to support the observation that the replacement of the wild-type P3 valine residue with the charged P3 arginine residue results in 5- to 14-fold increases in protease activity across multiple coronaviruses."}
