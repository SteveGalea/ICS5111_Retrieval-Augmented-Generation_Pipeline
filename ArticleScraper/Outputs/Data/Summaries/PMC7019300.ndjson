{"summary": "arenavirus-associated VHFs are zoonotic diseases, with humans acting as accidental hosts after contact with a viral reservoir, typically rodents. the old-world arenavirus complex known to cause VHF includes Lassa virus (LASV) and the recently discovered Lujo virus (LUJV) the most prevalent pathogen among the arenaviruses is LASV, the causative agent of Lassa fever (LF) bi-segmented RNA genome of the Arenaviridae family encodes four proteins. the Z protein regulates key host-cell functions through direct interactions to favor viral replication. previous studies have also revealed an inhibitory effect of the Z protein on both transcription and replication using a LCMV reverse genetic system. the arenavirus Z protein is central in the viral life cycle. it interacts with a variety of cellular factors that may have been only partially discovered and are not yet understood. twenty-four host-cell partners were identified and validated in a secondary Y2H assay. AH109 yeast cells were transformed with these baits using a standard lithium acetate protocol. PCR products were co-transformed into AH109 yeast cells expressing GAL4-BD-Z constructs together with an empty pPC86 vector linearized downstream of the GAL4-AD coding sequence. pPC86 vectors allow the reconstruction of GAL4-AD-Prey sequences. transformed cells were plated on selective -His media with 3AT at 5 mM for the MOPV-Z protein, and 100 mM for the LASV-Z protein. after five days of culture, growing colonies were scored. eGFP-ITCH-WT and eGFP-ITCH-C830A were engineered into peGFP-C1. eGFP-ITCH-WT and eGFP-ITCH-C830A were engineered into peGFP-C1. ITCH with a C-terminal HA tag was cloned in the phCMV-MCS plasmid. all plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. primary antibodies used were anti-actin (1:20,000; A3854) and anti-FLAG (1:3000; A8592), both from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) infectious medium was removed before adding fresh medium (DMEM 5% FBS, 0.5% PS) at indicated time points. all siRNA targeting ITCH, WWP1 or WWP2 as well as the non-targeting control siRNA came from Dharmacon. s, equal amounts of protein were loaded and separated on 4 to 15% gradient precast gels. samples were immunoblotted with the appropriate primary antibodies. protein levels were quantified by measuring intensity by densitometry. Actin or GAPDH were used as positive controls of the cell extracts. quantitative PCR for viral RNA was performed with the EuroBioGreen Lo-ROX qPCR mix (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), using primers 5\u2032-CTTTCCCCTGGCGTGTCA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GAATTTTGAAGGCTGCCTTGA-3\u2032 for MOPV. infectious foci were detected by incubation with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against MOPV, LASV, LCMV, or LUJV. the fluorescence of formaldehyde-fixed cells was measured using a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) the distribution of samples was analyzed by the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test before using non-parametric tests to determine the significance of differences between groups. AH109 yeast cells were transformed using a standard lithium acetate protocol. PCR products were co-transformed into AH109 yeast cells expressing GAL4-BD-Z constructs together with an empty pPC86 vector linearized downstream of the GAL4-AD coding sequence. cells between PCR products and linearized pPC86 vectors allow the reconstruction of GAL4-AD-Prey sequences. cells were plated on selective -His media supplemented with 3AT at 5 mM for the MOPV-Z protein, and 100 mM for the LASV-Z protein. after five days of culture, growing colonies were scored. Z ORFs of MOPV (ZMop), LASV (ZLas), LCMV (ZLcm), LUJV (ZLuj) and JUNV (ZJun) were cloned in the pHCMV-MCS between the XmaI and BamHI sites and carried a C-terminal FLAG. mutagenesis was performed with the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit II. ITCH with a C-terminal HA tag was cloned in the phCMV-MCS plasmid. the primary antibodies used for western blotting were anti-mouse conjugated to peroxidase (1:20,000; 111-035-174) and anti-rabbit conjugated to peroxidase (1:20,000; 111-035-144) infectious medium was removed before adding fresh medium (DMEM 5% FBS, 0.5% PS) at indicated time points. all siRNA targeting ITCH, WWP1 or WWP2 as well as the non-targeting control siRNA came from Dharmacon. samples were immunoblotted with the appropriate primary antibodies. protein levels were quantified by measuring intensity of bands by densitometry. quantitative PCR for viral RNA was performed with the EuroBioGreen Lo-ROX qPCR mix (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), using primers 5\u2032-CTTTCCCCTGGCGTGTCA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GAATTTTGAAGGCTGCCTTGA-3\u2032 for MOPV. Virus Titration Vero E6 cells were infected with sequential dilution of supernatant and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 for six days inant MOPV-WT or MOPV-ZFLAG at a MOI of 2 for 24 h. cells were harvested, washed, and the pellets suspended 20 min in PBS with 4% formaldehyde. cells were then harvested, washed, and the pellets suspended 20 min in PBS with 4% formaldehyde. interactions between bait and prey proteins lead to transactivation of the HIS3 reporter gene. a total of twenty-four host cell partners were identified. the interactions between ALIX and arenavirus Z protein have already been reported by others. autophagy 11 0 + CALCOCO2 10241 Autophagy 65 0 + OPTN 10133 Autophagy 7 0 + TAX1BP1 8887 Autophagy 60 0 + CAPRIN2 65981 Protein processing 4 13 + + GRIPAP1 56850 Protein processing 12 0 + AP1G2 8906 Protein processing 1 5 + + RINT1 60561 Protein processing 1 5 + + RINT1 60561 Protein processing 1 5 + + human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cells were efficiently depleted for ITCH, WWP1 or WWP2 compared to cells transfected with a non-targeting control siRNA. LUJV infectivity in ITCH-depleted cells was greater than that in cells depleted for WWP1 or WWP2. two days after infection, cell supernatants were harvested and titrated on vero cells. the viral titer was calculated as FFU/mL before normalization. the dotted line corresponds to the threshold at which a mean drop of 70% of infectious particles production was observed. 293T cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged ITCH and/or FLAG-tagged Z protein of MOPV (ZMop-FLAG), LASV (ZLas-FLAG), LCMV (ZLcm-FLAG), LUJV (ZLuj-FLAG), JUNV (ZJun-FLAG) after 15 h, cells were lysed and protein extracts were readily analyzed. cells were lysed (input) or immunoprecipitated with FLAG magnetic beads. exogenous eGFP-ITCH is shown in green and the MOPV and LASV Z-mCherry viral proteins are shown in red. two old-world arenaviruses were co-transfected with plasmids expressing a fluorescent Z protein of MOPV (ZMop-mCherry) and those expressing fluorescent ITCH (eGFP-ITCH) after 15 h of culture, cells were fixed and analyzed by confocal microscopy. the 293T cells were co-transfected with ITCH and the indicated FLAG-tagged Z mutants. most mutations were in the late domains (ZM-A17 to ZM-A21 and ZL-A16 to ZL-A20) ITCH was undetectable in the precipitates of cells transfected with ZM-A20 and ZM-A21 mutants of MOPV. the HA signal was lower in cells transfected with mutants ZM-A20 and ZL-A19. the late domain of MOPV and LASV Z protein is critical for Z ubiquitination. ITCH directly binds to the Z PPxY motif of the LASV and MOPV Z proteins. anti-HA, anti-ITCH, anti-FLAG, and anti-actin were used for western blotting analysis. 293T cells were transfected with a control plasmid or combinations of plasmids encoding HA-Ub, FLAG-tagged ZM or ZL, ITCH-C830A or the enzymatically inactive ITCH-C830A mutant. a basal amount of ubiquitinated forms of Z was still present when the dominant inactive form ITCH-C830A was transfected. we also noticed that a basal amount of ubiquitinated forms of Z was still present when the dominant inactive form ITCH-C830A was transfected. if ITCH can promote the ubiquitination of MOPV or LASV matrix protein, it is likely not the sole E3 ubiquitin ligas we measured the quantity of viral RNA and infectious particles in the supernatants and the quantity of viral RNA inside the cells. there was no difference in the amount of intracellular viral RNA between the si-CTL and si-ITCH conditions for either LASV or MOPV in both cell types. however, the quantity of viral RNA released into the supernatant of infected si-ITCH cells was significantly lower than that of the infected si-NT in both cell lines. the 293T cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA and cultured for 72 h before being transfected with an empty plasmid (CTL), or with the FLAG-tagged Z protein of MOPV or LASV (ZM-FLAG or ZL-FLAG) after 15 h of culture, cell extracts were directly analyzed by western blotting (cells), and supernatants were harvested. fewer MOPV and LASV VLPs for si-ITCH cells than those under control conditions. the reduction of VLP egress was similar for MOPV and LASV (approximately 50%) a total of twenty-four host cell partners were identified. the interactions between ALIX and arenavirus Z protein have already been reported. the screens revealed several other host-cell partners.

ITCH directly binds to the PPxY motif of the LASV and MOPV Z proteins. anti-HA, anti-ITCH, anti-FLAG, and anti-actin were used for western blotting analysis. 293T cells were transfected with a control plasmid or combinations of plasmids encoding HA-Ub, FLAG-tagged ZM or ZL, ITCH-WT, or an enzymatically inactive mutant of ITCH (ITCH-C830A) ubiquitinated forms of Z were still present when the dominant inactive form ITCH-C830A was transfected. a basal amount of ubiquitinated forms of Z was still present when the dominant inactive form was still present when the dominant inactive form ITCH-C830A was transfected. the data indicate that even if ITCH can promote the ubiquitination of MOPV or LASV matrix protein, it is likely not the sole E3 ubiquit fected with LASV or MOPV during 48 and 72 h respectively. we then measured the quantity of viral RNA and infectious particles in the supernatants. there was no difference in the amount of intracellular viral RNA between the si-CTL and si-ITCH conditions for either LASV or MOPV in both cell types. the 293T cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA and cultured for 72 h before being transfected with an empty plasmid (CTL) or with the FLAG-tagged Z protein of MOPV or LASV (ZM-FLAG or ZL-FLAG) after 15 h of culture, cell extracts were directly analyzed by western blotting (cells), and supernatants were harvested. natant of ITCH-depleted or control cells transfected with a FLAG-tagged MOPV or LASV Z protein. the reduction of VLP egress was similar for MOPV and LASV. the results show that ITCH positively regulates the late stages of both LASV and MOPV infection. the Y2H assay map cellular targets of the Z proteins from the pathogenic LASV and its non-pathogenic homolog MOPV. ITCH favors infectious-particle production of various arenaviruses, including MOPV and LASV. the Y2H assays could present a bias, as the Z protein localizes with cell membranes. six autophagy-related proteins that interact with the MOPV Z protein previously led us to investigate the impact of this pathway on MOPV and LASV infection. UBQLN family members are involved in the regulation of ubiquitinated proteins and their targeting towards autophagic degradation. this suggests that this interaction could participate in the hijacking of autophagy to the benefit of viral replication. the cellular RINT1 protein, which promotes human papillomavirus 16 replication, was shown to only interact with LASV Z protein in our Y2H assay [53]. it is possible that this protein plays a similar role during MOPV or LASV infection, by promoting internalization of the alpha-dystroglycan. immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the interaction between Z protein and ITCH for the previously tested old-world arenaviruses. less LUJV Z protein was associated with ITCH than that of the other viruses following HA- and FLAG-mediated immunoprecipitation. this is in accordance with the moderate loss of infectious-particle production by si-ITCH cells infected with LUJV. PPxY motif of LASV and MOPV Z protein interacts with the WW domain of ITCH and other E3 ubiquitin ligases such as WWP1 and WWP2. this dependence can be explained, in part, by the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of their Nedd4-family binding partners. the PPxY late domain of LCMV is not required for virus budding. it appears that the number and structure of such late domains could result in functional differences during viral budding. we chose to target ITCH by silencing experiments rather than using E3 ligases activity inhibitor. the silencing of ITCH decreased the proportion of LCMV VLPs released. a compound preventing PPxY-Nedd4 interaction inhibited both LCMV and LASV Z VLPs release. this study increases our understanding of mammarenaviruses infection by completing the interactome of LASV and MOPV Z protein."}
