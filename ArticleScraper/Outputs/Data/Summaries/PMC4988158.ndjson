{"summary": "double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a principal viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern that is recognized by cellular sensors. oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), protein kinase R (PKR), toll-like receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like the association of E3 with dsRNA in poxvirus-infected cells has not been reported. mutations in the C-terminal region of E3 that affect dsRNA binding in vitro do not uniformly correlate with the host range function. inactivation of another VACV protein, K3, results in enhanced interferon sensitivity and host range restriction. Knockdown of the cellular 5\u2032 exoribonuclease Xrn1 decreases VACV replication (32), resulting in defects similar to those of the D9/D10 deletion mutant (33), suggesting that decapping enzymes and Xrn1 catalyze successive steps in VACV mRNA degradation. this study was undertaken to compare the apparently complementary roles of E3 and D9/D10 in preventing innate immune responses. PKR (catalog number 700286; Life Technologies); mouse anti-FLAG M2 (catalog number F1804) and actin (catalog number A2066) were both from Sigma. the 0.5- to 10-kb RNA ladder (catalog number 15623-200) was from Life Technologies. the PKR-modified cell line was generated by inactivating the PKR gene in the RNase L-inactivated cells. the cells had a 13-bp deletion in exon 4 causing a frameshift. the PKR-modified cell line was generated by inactivating the PKR gene in the cells. the vE3L virus (E3L-F17R-venus) (39) was a gift of J. H. Connor (Boston University) the virus was made with a FLAG tag at their N and C termini. the vE3L-venus/FLAG-D9 and vE3L-venus/D10-FLAG viruses were constructed by homologous recombination in BHK-21 cells coinfected with 5 PFU/cell of v fluorescent plaques were picked and sequenced to identify the recombinant viruses. the inserted regions of the recombinant viruses were PCR amplified and sequenced to confirm their identities. samples were blocked in 4% FBS, incubated with primary antiserum, and incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies. nuclei and virus factories were stained with 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) images were collected on a leica DMI6000 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) cell lysates were washed twice with cold PBS on ice, harvested by scraping, and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) on wet ice for 30 min with frequent agitation. the supernatant was incubated with 2 g of J2 MAb for 3 h at 4\u00b0C in TBS for 1 h, the membrane was washed with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated with the primary antibody in 5% nonfat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. the membrane was washed, blocked, incubated with alkaline phosphatase. e-conjugated antibody to digoxigenin (Roche) and visualized with a chemiluminescence substrate on X-ray films. mice monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to E3 (34) and RNase L (35) were kind gifts of S. N. Isaacs (University of Pennsylvania) and R. H. Silverman (Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute) BHK-21 (ATCC CCL-10) cells were grown in minimum essential medium with Earle's balanced salts (EMEM) supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 g of streptomycin per ml. HAP1 control and genetically modified cell lines obtained from Horizon Discovery (Vienna) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (DMEM/F-12) medium ( pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP drives expression of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, GFP, and the chimeric guide RNA in mammalian cells. two days after transfection, single cells were sorted by flow cytometry to allow single-colony formation. the absence of proteins was confirmed by Western blotting. vD9muD10mu double mutant, with catalytic site mutations of D9 and D10, and the wild-type vD10rev (a revertant of a D10 mutant) viruses were previously described (5). the vFLAG-D9 and vD10-FLAG were made with a FLAG tag at their N and C termini. plaque assay disrupted in a chilled water bath sonicator with 30-s periods of vibration followed by 10-fold serial dilutions in EMEM supplemented with 2.5% FBS. cells were washed again and incubated with anti-VACV strain WR polyclonal antibody for 2 h. cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and mock infected with 5 PFU/cell of purified virus for 13 h. cells were mock infected or infected with 5 PFU/cell of virus for 13 h. the cells were fixed with IC fixation buffer (Life Technologies) on ice for 15 min. the cells were incubated with dsRNA J2 MAb in IC permeabilization buffer (Life Technologies) on ice for 30 min. the supernatant was incubated with 2 g of J2 MAb for 3 h at 4\u00b0C on a rotating wheel and then with 20 l of protein G conjugated to Dynabeads magnetic beads. the beads were then washed four times with IP buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling. eIF2, PKR, and IRF3 cells were lysed with buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors. total RNA from infected cells was isolated using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), resolved by electrophoresis on a glyoxal gel (Life Technologies), transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane using an iBlot system. in vitro dsRNA binding studies used a MAb specific for dsRNA of more than 40 bp (43\u201346) to visualize dsRNA foci by fluorescence microscopy in cells infected with VACV. the amount of dsRNA in monkey BS-C-1 cells infected with vD9muD10mu was approximately 15-fold greater than that in cells infected with vD10rev. cells were mock infected or infected with 5 PFU per cell of vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, or vE3L. after 13 h, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for dsRNA with J2 MAb (green) and for E3 with E3 MAb (red), followed by isotype-specific IgG2A and IgG3 fluorescent secondary antibodies. cells were imaged by conf dsRNA-positive cells were similar in mock-infected A549 cells and cells infected with vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, and vE3L. a smaller number of cells infected with vD10rev scored positive for dsRNA. but the fluorescence intensity of a minority overlapped with that of cells infected with vE3L. the ability of vD10rev-E3-GFP to replicate in human cells provided evidence for the function of the fusion protein. colocalization of dsRNA and E3 in virus factories was visualized using the J2 MAb to detect dsRNA. vD9muD10mu-E3-GFP was also used to demonstrate interaction of dsRNA with a virus factory. human cells have advantages for studying innate immunity and genetic modification. human cells have advantages for studying innate immunity and for genetic modification. both human parental cell lines were permissive for wild-type virus. the vE3L mutant replicated in PKR KO cells and in HAP1 cells. the mutant replicated in PKR but not in single PKR or RNase L KO A549 cells. the absence of activated RNase L explains the ability of vE3L to replicate in PKR as well as in DKO HAP1 cells. s in 12-well plates were infected with 5 PFU/cell of purified vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, or vE3L. the 3-h titers represent input virus. (C and D) Procedures were same as those described for panels A and B except that A549 control and KO cells were used. KO + +c + a Cells were harvested at 24 h after infection. transmission electron microscopy was performed to compare the replication defect of vD9muD10mu in both cells infected with vD10rev. large numbers of immature and mature virions were present in both cells infected with vD9muD10mu. time course experiments were carried out to investigate the differential replication of vD10rev, vE3L, and vD9muD10mu in HAP1 KO cells. Lysates, obtained at 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after infection, were analyzed by probing Western blots with broadly reactive VACV antibodies. in cells infected with vD10rev, major viral proteins were detected as faint bands at 4 h and increased at 8 and 12 h control, RNase L KO, PKR KO, and DKO HAP1 cells were mock infected or infected with 5 PFU/cell of purified vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, or vE3L virus. at 13 h after infection, the cells were harvested, and the total RNAs were isolated and resolved on glyoxal gels. rRNAs were stained with ethidium bromide antibody to the E3 protein was detected from 2 to 12 h after infection. the absence of a band in cells infected with vE3L confirmed the KO and antibody specificity. the mutant viruses were faint or undetectable in control and KO cells infected with vD9muD10mu. the absence of active RNase L activity may be due to low basal levels of OAS. early mRNAs are synthesized within virus cores derived from the infecting virions. intermediate and late mRNAs require DNA replication and de novo viral protein synthesis. mRNA was faint or undetectable in all cells infected with vD9muD10mu. in control and RNase L KO cells infected with vE3L, only a small amount of GAPDH RNA persisted. mRNA was diminished when viral late mRNA and protein synthesis increased in PKR KO and DKO cells infected with vE3L. phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2 was intense as early as 4 h and even in the presence of AraC. the small amounts of phosphorylated eIF2 bands detected in PKR KO and DKO HAP1 cells were presumably due to membrane-associated PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) sRNA, gene expression, and replication of the two viruses. dsRNA made in cells infected with vE3L and vD10rev can activate PKR and eIF2. vD10rev activation at late times of infection does not block virus replication. control and KO A549 KO cells were mock infected or infected with vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, or vE3L in the absence or presence of AraC. the cells were harvested at 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after infection and analyzed by Western blotting with a MAb to E3. total RNA was isolated from cells infected as described for panel A. we wanted to be certain that the effects on viral protein synthesis were not related in part to decreased synthesis of the early E3 dsRNA binding protein. similar amounts of E3 were detected over time by Western blotting with an E3-specific MAb in control and KO cells infected with vD9muD10mu. control and Xrn1 KO A549 cells were mock infected or infected with 5 PFU per cell of purified vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, or vE3L. fluorescent cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. in contrast to rRNA, the amount of intact F17 mRNA depends on synthesis. at 13 h, GAPDH mRNA was undetectable in cells infected with vD10rev. mRNA was detected in the KO cells infected with vD9muD10mu or vE3L. mRNA was detected in the KO cells infected with vD9muD10mu. A549 cells and A549 PKR+RNase L DKO cells were used to make Xrn1 KO and Xrn1+PKR+RNase L triple-KO cells. Western blotting with Xrn1 and actin antibodies confirmed inactivation of the Xrn1 gene. vFLAG-D9, vD10-FLAG, vFLAG-D9E3L, or vD10-FLAGE3L were fected with 5 PFU/cell of vFLAG-D9, vD10-FLAG, or vD10-FLAGE3L. at 13 h after infection, the cells were harvested, and lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. a double KD with PKR plus Xrn1 had less effect, and a triple KD of RNase L, PKR, and Xrn1 was no better than KD of RNase L and Xrn1. however, in neither the double nor the triple KD was the effect on virus replication determined. both mutant viruses appeared to further increase phosphorylation of PKR. vD10rev and vD9muD10mu were unable to replicate in Xrn1 KO cells. vD10rev was unable to replicate significantly in the Xrn1 KO cells. vD10rev replicated nearly as well in TKO cells as in control and DKO cells. viral protein synthesis was more strongly inhibited in Xrn1 KO cells infected with vD9muD10mu than in similarly infected control cells. phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2 was detected in control and Xrn1 KO A549 cells infected with vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, and vE3L. however, phosphorylation of eIF vFLAG-D9 and vD10-FLAG replicated well in control, DKO, and TKO cells. vE3L/FLAG-D9 and vE3L/D10-FLAG replicated only in DKO and TKO cells. but only a small amount of D10-FLAG and no FLAG-D9 was detected in Xrn1 KO cells. the absence of D9 in cells infected with vE3L/D10-FLAG was surprising. however, the absence of D9 was surprising since D9 has been considered an early protein. this was based solely on analysis of the mRNAs (56, 57) the amount of dsRNA in monkey BS-C-1 cells infected with vD9muD10mu was approximately 15-fold greater than that in cells infected with vD10rev. a strict coincidence of dsRNA and E3 in cytoplasmic DNA factories was visualized by confocal microscopy of human A549 cells infected with vD9muD10mu. only tiny dsRNA puncta, which cells were infected with 5 PFU per cell of vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, or vE3L. cells were fixed, permeabilized, stained for dsRNA with J2 MAb (green) and for E3 with E3 MAb (red) followed by isotype-specific IgG2A and IgG3 fluorescent secondary antibodies. dsRNA-positive cells were similar in cells infected with vD9muD10mu and vE3L. the fluorescence intensity of a minority overlapped with that of cells infected with vD9muD10mu and was higher than that of cells infected with vE3L. however, the large number of dsRNA-positive cells infected with vE3L compared to that in cells infected with sRNA and E3 in virus factories was visualized using the J2 MAb to detect dsRNA. vD9muD10mu-E3-GFP was also detected by Western blotting. a small amount of RIG-I, another dsRNA binding protein, was immunoprecipitated. both human parental cell lines were permissive for wild-type virus but nonpermissive for vD9muD10mu and vE3L. inactivation of RNase L and PKR gene expression was demonstrated by Western blotting. vE3L mutant replicated in PKR but not in single PKR or RNase L KO A549 cells. absence of activated RNase L explains the ability of vE3L to replicate in PKR. inability of vE3L to replicate in either single PKR or single RNase L KO A549 cells indicated that activation of either pathway blocks VACV replication in the absence of E3. the 3-h titers represent input virus. (C and D) Procedures were the same as those described for panels A and B except that A549 control and KO cells were used. each bar represents the standard deviation determined from three replicate infections. transmission electron microscopy was performed to compare the replication defect of vD9muD10mu in both DKO cell lines infected with vD10rev. large numbers of immature and mature virions were present in both DKO cell lines infected with vD9muD10mu. lymphates obtained at 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after infection were analyzed by probing Western blots with broadly reactive VACV antibodies that recognize abundant postreplicative proteins. in cells infected with vD10rev, major viral proteins were detected as faint bands at 4 h and increased at 8 and 12 h in control and RNase L KO cell lines, with only a slight enhancement at 4 h. KO, PKR KO, and DKO HAP1 cells were mock infected or infected with 5 PFU/cell of purified vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, or vE3L virus. at 13 h after infection, the cells were harvested, and the total RNAs were isolated and resolved on glyoxal gels. rRNAs were stained with ethidium bromide and detected by UV flu the absence of a band in cells infected with vE3L confirmed the KO and antibody specificity. western blots probed with antibodies to the D13 and A3 proteins were used to analyze representative intermediate and late proteins. the proteins were faint or undetectable in control and RNase L KO cells infected with vD9muD10mu or vE3L. early mRNAs are synthesized within virus cores derived from the infecting virions. intermediate and late mRNAs require DNA replication and de novo viral protein synthesis. the late C17 mRNA was detected in all cells infected with vD10rev and vD9muD10mu. however, KO of PKR or PKR and RNase L was required for detection of F17 mRNA in cells infected with phosphorylated forms of PKR and eIF2 were detected with specific antibodies at 8 h. in control and RNase L KO cells infected with vE3L, phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2 was intense as early as 4 h. phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2 was intense as early as 4 h. PKR KO and DKO HAP1 cells were infected with 5 PFU/cell of purified vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, or vE3L in the absence or presence of AraC. the lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antibodies to phosphorylated PKR (-p-PKR) studies with A549 KO cells would allow us to compare the relative effects of RNase L and PKR on viral protein synthesis. vD9muD10mu activation could not be done in HAP1 cells because of intrinsic deficiency in RNase L activation. control and KO A549 cells were mock infected or infected with vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, or vE3L. at 13 h after infection, the cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal antibody to VACV proteins and actin. the effects on viral protein synthesis in A549 cells infected with vD9muD10mu were not related in part to decreased synthesis of the early E3 dsRNA binding protein. similar amounts of E3 were detected over time by Western blotting with an E3-specific MAb in control and KO cells infected with vD10rev and vD9muD10mu. Xrn1 KO cells were mock infected or infected with 5 PFU per cell of purified vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, or vE3L, harvested after 13 h. fluorescent cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. GAPDH mRNA was detected in the RNase L KO cells infected with vD9muD10mu or vE3L but not in PKR KO cells in which RNase L was active. we also analyzed activation of IRF3 and eIF2 in A549 KO cells. cells and A549 PKR+RNase L cells were used to make Xrn1 KO and Xrn1+PKR+RNase L triple-KO (TKO) cells were infected with 5 PFU/cell of purified vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, and vE3L. cells were lysed at 3 and 24 h to determine virus input and yield. cells were mock infected with vFLAG-D9 or vD10-FLAG in absence of AraC. at indicated hours after infection, the cells were harvested. lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to the FLAG epitope or actin. Xrn1 KO cells were infected with vD9mu but not with vD10mu. no dsRNA was detected in either Xrn1 or Xrn1 KO cells. no dsRNA was detected in either A549 or Xrn1 KO cells. vD10rev replicated nearly as well in Xrn1 KO cells as in control and DKO cells. vD9muD10mu and vE3L were unable to replicate in Xrn1 KO cells. inhibition of viral protein synthesis was similar to that in control and vE3L. Xrn1 KO cells infected with vD9muD10mu contribute to destabilization of mRNAs. phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2 was detected in control. but phosphorylation of eIF2 was not detected in infected cells lacking PKR. in order to detect D9 and D10, we constructed recombinant viruses with a FLAG epitope tag on the N terminus of D9 (vFLAG-D9) and on the C terminus of D10 (vD10-FLAG) and the corresponding E3 deletion mutants (vE3L/FLAG-D9 and vE3L/D10-FLAG). after infection with vFLAG-D9 and vD10-FLAG, the FLAG-tagged D9 and D10 viruses were used in a western blotting experiment. at 3 h, a strong D9 band was present, whereas D10 was not detected until 6 h unless the blot was greatly over exposed. however, the intensity of D9 was considerably less at 9 and 12 h in the presence of the DNA replication inhibitor. failure to synthesize D9 and D10 could contribute to the phenotypes of the E3 deletion mutant in control dsRNA colocalized with viral E3 protein in discrete foci within virus factories in cells infected with wild-type VACV or a decapping enzyme mutant. ii) viral late gene expression was more profoundly inhibited in cells infected with an E3 deletion mutant than in those infected with the decapping enzyme mutant. poly(IC) was reported more than 2 decades ago, suggesting that E3 acts by sequestering dsRNA (11), yet we were unable to find a publication documenting such an association in infected cells. we first used isotype-specific dsRNA and E3 MAbs to show that all dsRNA foci colocalized with E3 in cells infected with the decapping enzyme mutant or wild-type VACV. the rapid shutdown of viral gene expression by the E3 mutant prevented synthesis of viral intermediate and late mRNAs. the formation of dsRNA and activation of innate immune responses eventually occurred after infection with wild-type VACV. the acquisition of resistance to PKR and RNase L activation could be due to the localization of transcription and translation within viral factories. PKR KO was functionally a DKO after administration of interferon. the restricted replication of the E3 mutant was overcome solely by inactivating PKR in HAP1 cells. inactivation of both PKR and RNase L was necessary in A549 cells. this virus was unable to replicate significantly in the DKO HAP1 cell lines. replication was suboptimal in DKO A549 cells. the replication defect of wild-type VACV caused by KO of Xrn1 was overcome in a triple KO of PKR, PKR, and Xrn1. KO of RNase L and PKR in A549 cells had a lesser effect on replication of the decapping enzyme mutant. the role of decapping enzymes may be to regulate the stabilities of viral and cellular mRNAs."}
