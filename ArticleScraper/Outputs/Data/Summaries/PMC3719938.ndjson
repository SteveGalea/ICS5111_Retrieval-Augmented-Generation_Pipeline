{"summary": "innate immune system plays a critical role in the recognition of viral infections and mounting anti-viral responses. mast cells produce and secrete a wide variety of biologically active mediators such as heparin, histamine, tryptase and cytokines. the role of MCs in the defence against viruses is less well characterized. MC interactions with viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic viral myocarditis [17] cultured human MCs elicit a strong anti-viral response to intracellular viral dsRNA and live Sendai virus. MCs possess RIG-1 and MDA-5 as sensor elements for cytosolic viral RNA. the isolated CD34+ cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) they were supplemented with HEPES (25 mM), L-glutamine (2 mM), 2-mercaptoethanol (01 mM), 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), recombinant human insulin (10 g/ml), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 g/m recombinant human IL-29 and IFN- were used at 50 ng/ml and 200 IU/ml concentrations. real-time PCR Total cellular RNA was isolated with RNeasy columns and RNase-Free DNase set. cDNAs were amplified on an ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System. 10 milligrams of whole cell lysate was separated on a 15% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) the membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% non-fat milk and stained with rabbit anti-human MxA and rabbit anti-human IFIT3 antibodies. after this, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature (RT) with horseradish peroxidase ( isolated cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. the cells and cell-free culture supernatants were harvested 1\u201324 h after the infections. samples were prepared for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), -hexosaminidase and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Western blot MCs were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 74), 150 mM NaCl and 25% ethylene glycol. lysate was separated on a 15% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the membranes were stained with rabbit anti-human MxA and rabbit anti-human IFIT3 antibodies (Imgenex, San Diego, CA, USA) extracellular and cytoplasmic dsRNA induces strong expression of IFNs and TNF- by mast cells Viral infections typically involve the presence of virus replication intermediates. multiple signalling cascades are activated during viral infection by the host cell, leading to the production of IFNs and other cytokines. the cells were then sedimented and total cellular RNA was extracted and analysed for mRNA expression of IFN-, IFN-, interleukin (IL)-29 and TNF- by quantitative real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2013PCR) the data show relative units (RU), i.e. fold change in gene expression normalized to 18S as an endogenous reference gene. mRNA expression by quantitative real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2013PCR) data show relative units (RU) as in Fig. 1. data are mean standard deviation from cells derived from three donors. both mxA and IFIT3 mRNAs and proteins were produced in human MCs following Sendai virus infection. mast cells were cultured in the presence of Sendai virus or left untreated for 4\u201320 h. expression of MDA-5, RIG-1 and TLR-3 is up-regulated during viral infection. both type 1 and 3 IFNs are known to activate anti-viral responses in human dendritic cells [22]. we treated MCs with type 1 IFN (IFN-) and type 3 IFN (IL-29) and a combination of both. in contrast, IL-29 had no effect on the expression of these genes. cultured human mast cells were incubated in the presence of Sendai virus or left untreated for 4\u201320 h (a) the cells were then sedimented, and total cellular RNA was extracted and analysed for RIG-1, MDA-5, TLR-3 and MCP-1 mRNA expression. dsRNA induces interferon (IFN) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- expression in human mast cells. poly(I:C) was either added to cell culture media or transfected into cytoplasm. cells were then sedimented, and total cellular RNA was extracted. exposure to live Sendai virus induces anti-viral response in human mast cells. cultured human mast cells were incubated in the presence of Sendai virus or left untreated for 4\u201320 h. the supernatants were collected and analysed for IL-29 and -hexosaminidase release by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a colorimetric assay. data are mean standard deviation from cells derived from three donors. expression of MDA-5, RIG-1 and TLR-3 is up-regulated during Sendai virus infection. expression of these genes is known to be up-regulated during viral infection. both type 1 and 3 IFNs are known to activate anti-viral responses in dendritic cells. IL-6 expression, MCP-1 expression was not induced in response to viral infection or type 1 IFN stimulation. expression of retinoic acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-1), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) is up-regulated in human mast cells during Sendai virus infection. MCs have been shown to interact with several viruses (see [24]. in response to viral antigens or virus infection, human MCs have been shown to elicit secretion of cytokines and chemokines, e.g. CCL4, CXCL8 and CXCL10 [15,27] the type 3 IFN family comprises of multiple IFN- isoforms and single IFN-. IL-29 is produced by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [30] and monocyte-derived dendritic cells [31] in response to viral infection [32] and poly(I:C) stimulation [33]. rheumatoid arthritis is often activated during viral infections. local activation of human MCs by viruses could be a contributing factor in the inflammatory reaction, which takes place in the atherosclerotic arterial wall. the authors declare no conflicts of interest."}
