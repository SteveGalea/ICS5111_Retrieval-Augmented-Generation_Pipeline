CNOT6 is the most similar enzyme to PDE12 with 31% amino acid sequence identity in the EEP nuclease domain. kcat and Km values were determined by fitting the initial rate of AMP formation as a function of substrate concentration to Equation 4. PDE12 prefers 2\u20135A with a 2-fold higher kcat/Km compared with oligoA. CNOT6 also prefers 2\u20135A. value for PDE12 enzyme inhibition is consistent for all compounds tested in this series. we evaluated the effect of compound 1 in the HeLaPDE12 cells. the IFN-poly(I-C)-induced level of 2\u20135A was increased as expected. HRV alone resulted in a 15% increase in 2\u20135A compared with background levels observed in uninfected cells. prior treatment with IFN resulted in a slightly greater increase. the compounds in this series appear to have some anti-proliferative PDE12-independent activities at higher concentrations. Typically, the antiviral activity of these compounds is 10\u201330-fold more potent than the anti-proliferative activity. four different out-of-frame gene deletions were found with no wild-type sequence detected. these results confirm that the parent HeLa cells are tetraploid for the PDE12 locus. the clone contained a frameshift mutation in the targeted coding region for each allele. the cells were transfected with the double-stranded RNA mimetic, poly(I-C), to activate OAS. the cells were lysed and 2\u20135A in the lysate was quantified using purified RNase-L as a sensor. the cells contained 5 times more 2\u20135A than the parental HeLa cells. the fraction of cells remaining as a function of m.o.i. for each cell line was fit to a four-parameter logistic curve. the inflection point (m.o.i. EC50) for each cell line was (2.92 0.02) 104 compared with (1.91 0.07) 102 for HeLaPDE12. the fraction of cells infected at a low m.o.i. in HeLaPDE12 did not progress. thus, PDE12 inactivation did not affect the initial infection. inhibition of 2\u20135A may enhance the immune response to a variety of viruses such as the important respiratory pathogens HRV and RSV.

AMP formed was determined as a function of time from 20-min progress curves conducted in triplicate. pXC50 represents the negative log of the IC50 in molar (pEC50) for HeLa 2\u20135A, pXC50 represents negative log of the inflection point of the increase (pEC50) the values presented are the mean S.D. from the number of replicate experimental determinations. a novel hit identification platform uses ultra-large collections of chemotypically diverse DNA-encoded small molecule libraries. the protein target is immobilized on beads and incubated with a compound library in solution. the platform features two major benefits, access to a broad set of chemotypes with vast structural diversity. compound 3 shows a very optimized fit and displays several important ligand-protein interactions. the 6-CN moiety on the indole forms a favorable hydrogen bonding interaction (2.2 ) with the backbone NH of Thr-500. any attempts to replace this nitrile with bioisosteres proved deleterious to potency. substitutions at the 5-benzimidazole position impart a steric effect. the 4-CO adopted a perpendicular orientation with respect to the benzimidazole ring maximizing the interaction between the CO and the magnesium. FIGURE 5. Co-crystal structure of compound 3 bound to the PDE12 catalytic domain construct, PDE12 (155\u2013609206\u2013233) compound 3 inhibits PDE12 by competing with 2\u20135A substrate. CNOT6 is the most similar enzyme to PDE12 with 31% amino acid sequence identity in the EEP nuclease domain (41). effect of PDE12 inhibitors on cellular 2\u20135A, RNase-L Activation, and Virus Infection resulted in increased 2\u20135A induced by IFN and poly(I-C) compound 1 produced a maximum 4-fold increase in 2\u20135A levels, similar to what was seen with gene inactivation. rRNA from HeLa cells was extracted and analyzed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Lane 1, untreated HeLa cells. Lane 3, HeLa cells treated for 2 h with IFN and poly(I-C) in the presence of 1 m compound 1. compound 1 inhibited the EMCV-induced cytopathic effect in HeLa cells with a pIC50 of 6.7. the compound inhibited the proliferation of both HeLa and HeLaPDE12 cells with a pIC50 of 5.7. targeted short genomic deletions were created by transfection of TALEN constructs. one cell line was selected that appeared to have four separate PDE12 alleles each containing a distinct out-of-frame deletion in the targeted region of exon 1. Alleles 1\u20134, length and positions of the first deleted nucleotide are shown in red. Lane 1, 40 g of total cellular protein from HeLa cells. Lane 2, 40 g of total cellular protein from HeLa cells. fraction of cells infected by RSV-L was determined by immunofluorescence and imaging at the indicated m.o.i. and time of incubation for infection. EMCV infection was determined indirectly by measuring virus-induced CPE. HeLa cells were significantly more sensitive to infection by RSV than HRV. by day 2, both HeLa and HeLaPDE12 were similarly infected in an m.o.i.-dependent manner. however, with longer incubation, the fraction of cells infected by RSV did not progress. residues 207\u2013222 appear to be on a disordered loop connecting two adjacent anti-parallel -strands. a construct was subsequently created that removed these disordered residues. it is unlikely that this deletion influences the binding of substrate or inhibitors due to the location of these residues on the face opposite the catalytic domain. the structure of PDE12 shows the protein forms two clear domains, an N-terminal domain composed of residues 161\u2013274 and a C-terminal domain composed of residues 275\u2013609. the structure of the enzyme shows the protein forms two clear domains, an N-terminal domain composed of residues 161\u2013274 and a C-terminal domain composed of residues 275\u2013609. the Mg2+ ion unique to CNOT6 is shown in green. the active site cleft of CNOT6 is apparent in the structure of the PDE12 catalytic domain. the metal-chelating residues in the active site are conserved between PDE12 and CNOT6. residues 267\u2013280 extend up and away from the active site cleft. a single tight -turn at residues 378\u2013379 bridges the -strands forming a much less defined end to the active site cleft. residues 202\u2013204, which help to form one side of the active site cleft in CNOT6, are replaced by a longer region. 1 nm PDE12 103 4 27 0.5 2.6 105 280 100 11 3 0.39 105 17.5 0.8 CNOT6 45 7 6 0.3 1.3 105 164 86 2.6 0.7 0.16 105 >10,000 TABLE 3. a small hydrophobic core is formed by residues Phe-172, Met-174, Phe-177, and Pro-274 of the N-terminal domain. the structure of PDE12 identified a unique cleft in a catalytic domain shared by the EEP nuclease family. the protein target is immobilized on beads and incubated with a compound library in solution. Compound 3 represents one of the first active molecules designed and was chosen as the starting point for our hit optimization effort. the helix represents the position of DNA tags used to identify protein-bound compounds following DNA sequencing. C2 represents the variants found at position R (green). alcohol at the 2-position on morpholine forms a crucial H-bonding interaction (1.4) with Glu-351. any capping of this moiety results in a dramatic drop in potency. the structure also reveals a -stacking interaction between the neighboring phenyl group and Tyr-307. compound 3 inhibits PDE12 by competing with 2\u20135A substrate. initial rate of AMP produced was analyzed at five fixed concentrations of compound 3 using a range of 2\u20135A as substrate from 1 to 250 m. de12 and CNOT6 cleave both substrates efficiently (kcat/Km near 105 m1 s1) both enzymes have a slight preference for cleaving 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate. but chain length differences between 2\u20135A (3 nucleotides) and oligoA (12 nucleotides) may also contribute to the observed kinetic parameters. the IFN-poly(I-C)-induced level of 2\u20135A was increased compared with the parent HeLa line as expected. Compound 1 did not increase the 2\u20135A level further at any concentration. the ability of compounds in this series to increase 2\u20135A is dependent upon the presence of a functional PDE12 enzyme. compound 1 inhibited the EMCV-induced cytopathic effect in HeLa cells with a pIC50 of 6.7. compound 1 inhibited the proliferation of both HeLa and HeLaPDE12 cells with a pIC50 of 5.7. compound 1 inhibited the proliferation of both HeLa and HeLaPDE12 cells. the mechanism of the PDE12-independent anti-proliferative activity is unknown. our results suggest that PDE12 inhibitors exert an antiviral effect through modulation of the IFN-induced OAS/RNase-L pathway. this pathway may be altered in the HeLa cell background due to changes associated with oncogenesis. de12 cells showed increased 2\u20135A compared with the parent HeLa cell line. this confirms that PDE12 controls cellular 2\u20135A levels in response to stimuli known to activate OAS. the delayed antiviral response may be attributed to the time required for the host cells to respond to the initial infection. the structures of PDE12 reveal similarities with other members of the nuclease family. the structures of PDE12 reveal similarities with other members of the nuclease family. comparison of PDE12 and CNOT6 reveals important differences. CNOT6 contains an 11-residue insertion that provides a well defined end to the active site cleft. the absence of these residues in PDE12 opens up the cleft. the significance of these differences is unknown but may affect cleavage of longer substrates. the localization of PDE12 to the mitochondrial matrix confounds our understanding of the subcellular compartmentalization of the OAS/2\u20135A/RNase-L pathway. however, OAS and RNase-L have been shown to be associated with mitochondria. the effect of gene inactivation and inhibitors on mitochondrial biology has not yet been studied. blocking PDE12 activity through gene inactivation or with small molecules enhances cellular resistance to viral pathogens. a variety of important pathogens are affected by modulation of OAS and RNase-L, including west Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, dengue virus, and hepatitis C virus (5, 48\u201352). the final version of the manuscript was approved."}
