{"summary": "results and Discussion Design and Characterization of Cyclic Antiparallel Helical Hairpins. helix\u2013turn\u2013helix motif stabilized by backbone cyclization as well as side chain cross-linking. helix\u2013loop\u2013helix motif from the Rop protein (38) was used as the starting template. structure of 2H (red spheres represent Ala11 and Ala30 side chains), blue spheres represent Leu8 and Leu27 side chains. root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is 0.3 0.1. a zoomed-in view of the L- motif in 2H and designed model. the bicyclic peptide (2H) had a CD spectrum very similar to the side chain cross-linked peptide (2H-3), indicating that the additional backbone cyclic restraint was structurally well accommodated. however, the converse was not true, because the backbone cyclized peptide (2H-2) showed low helicity in the absence of the xylyl cross-link. a side chain cross-link can serve as a powerful restraint to stabilize the fold of a relatively short helical hairpin, smaller than those seen in isolation in natural proteins. xylyl and related side chain cross-linking strategies might be used to stabilize minimal versions natural proteins. we used symmetric sequence design tools to design a sequence for the helices and loops. we chose the most promising candidates by Rosetta energy and by visual inspection. final sequences were validated by Rosetta ab initio structure prediction. 3H1 has a very small hydrophobic core responsible for stabilizing its structure. only 20 unique assignable amino acid residues were observed, indicating 3H1 is threefold symmetric as in the design. the design of Tricyclic CovCore Protein 3H2 is shown in Fig. 6. we first used Rosetta and a loop-searching algorithm to search the best loops for bridging adjacent helices. helical based on CD spectra with thermal melting temperature of 55.8 \u00b0C for linear precursor (3H2-1) and 64.9 \u00b0C for cyclized precursor (3H2-2) ellipticity at both 208 and 222 nm increased considerably irrespective of the main chain backbone cyclization. the crystallographic structure of 3H2 at 1.20 resolution was solved through direct methods using Arcimboldo (52) to a crystallographic R-factor of 0.144 (R-free 0.178) in CCP4 (53) there are six 3H2 protein molecules in the asymmetric unit, with four (chains A\u2013D) molecules adopting one conformation and the other two (chains E and F) adopting a different conformation. conformation 1 and conformation 2 can be superimposed if they are overlaid in reverse directions. one possible explanation for this observation is the binary pattern of hydrophobic and polar residues in the sequence of 3H2 is largely invariant. we only observed three isoleucine peaks from the crystal structure. we found that four residues in conformation 2 (chain E) adopted left-handed helix. this suggests conformation 2 is in a high-energy state, which might convert to conformation 1 in solution. crystal structure of the Rop protein (PDB ID 4DO2) was extracted and duplicated. the blue helix was merged with the red helix to produce the purple helix. the sequence design of 2H-2 was guided by TERMs-based structural database mining (13), which guides selection of residues that stabilize both the main chain conformation as well as the interhelical packing. the final design (2H-2) has an alanine coil conformation (41) with alanine residues packing tightly between the two helices. the solution NMR structure of 2H is in excellent agreement with the designed model. the backbone heavy atom root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 20 lowest-energy structures (Fig. 3D) is 0.3 0.1 for 2H. xylyl and related side chain cross-linking strategies might be used to stabilize minimal versions natural proteins. we used the Rosetta software suite (12) to design a three-helix structure not previously seen in nature. we first made use of parametric backbone generation strategies to create various helical conformations of a monomer. 3H1 energy landscape predicted by Rosetta ab initio structure prediction. blue points represent relaxation of the designed model. orange points represent relaxation of the designed model. the solution NMR structure of 3H1 is in reasonable agreement with its designed structure. only 20 unique assignable amino acid residues were observed, indicating 3H1 is indeed threefold symmetric as in the design. the most common loop sequence, excluding those with proline, was \u2013NGD\u2013 followed by \u2013GGD\u2013. we then used Rosetta\u2019s fixed backbone side chain design application (48) to redesign the sequence for more compact hydrophobic core packing as well as to reduce the hydrophilicity of 3H1. 3H2 thermal melting also displays high thermal stability. the mean residue ellipticity of 3H2 is higher than that of 3H1 at all temperatures tested. the topology of conformation 1 is opposite to that of conformation 2. the three helices (H1\u2013H3) from conformation 1 are arranged in a counterclockwise direction. the same three helices (H1\u2013H3) in conformation 2 are arranged in a clockwise direction. the same three helices (H1\u2013H3) in conformation 2 are arranged in a clockwise direction. 3H2 has three isoleucine residues in its sequence, which would be in identical chemical environments in a C3-symmetric structure. the sequence is aligned on the cross-linking Cys residue. ation 2 is in a high-energy state, which might convert to conformation 1 in solution. but due to the sequence degeneracy, we were unable to determine the solution NMR structure of 3H2. this asymmetric scaffold serendipitously opens new doors in terms of inhibiting protein\u2013protein interactions."}
