{"summary": "case series We performed enucleation surgery on 15 clinically affected animals (2 rats and 13 mice) these rodents were of various ages, stocks, strains, and genetic alterations. all lesions were unilateral and varied from severe corneal ulceration to overt rupture of the globe. rats were SPF for sialodacryoadenitis virus, Kilham rat virus, rat parvovirus, Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus, Mycoplasma pulmonis, and mouse adenovirus. anesthesia was induced by administering isoflurane (4%) in an induction box, with subsequent transfer to a modified nosecone. after the induction of anesthesia, rodents received buprenor the site was closed using a simple interrupted pattern of 4-0 polydioxanone suture. a drop of skin glue was added to the surgical site to prevent dehiscence due to self-trauma. each cage contained 1/4 of a carprofen chew tab (2-mg tablet, Bio-serv, Flemington, NJ), shredded paper strips, and a cotton nesting square. mice and rats were acclimated for at least 7 d prior to experimental use. anesthetic nose cone was created by removing the top of a 3-mL syringe. this replaced the standard nose cone, allowing for adequate access to the eye while maintaining a surgical plane of anesthesia. the periorbital region was shaved and cleaned by using alternating chlorhexidine and saline scrubs. the small globe was removed and the orbit flushed with sterile saline. vessels were too small to ligate even with 5-0 suture. sterile swabs were used to provide hemostasis. all 20 mice and rats that underwent enucleation surgery survived to the study endpoint (2 mo postoperatively, n = 18) or to their planned endpoint (1 or 3 wk postoperatively, n = 2). we performed right unilateral enucleation in 5 clinically normal mice to histologically evaluate the orbital space. erian gland showed localized necrosis accompanied by dilation or atrophy of remaining acini. mild granulomatous inflammation was present within and immediately adjacent to the area of necrosis. no evidence of infection, such as suppurative inflammation or bacteria, was present. all 20 mice and rats that underwent surgery survived to the study endpoint (2 mo postoperatively, n = 18) or to their planned endpoint (1 or 3 wk postoperatively, n = 2). tarsorrhaphy with trimmed lid margins and closure with tissue glue prevented future dehiscence of the site. the enucleation site was 10 wk postoperatively compared with (B) contralateral control. no evidence of infection, such as suppurative inflammation or bacteria, was present. rodents can develop exposure keratopathy and corneal ulceration after prolonged anesthesia, particularly with ketamine\u2013xylazine combinations. corneal lesions can occur secondary to systemic disease, including coronavirus infection and mycoplasmosis. enucleation could be used as a'rescue' strategy for a valuable animal with bilateral corneal disease. if a particular line of genetically altered animals consistently presents with bilateral ocular disease prior to reaching their research endpoint, the animal welfare implications of bilateral enucleation should be assessed on a case-by-case basis."}
