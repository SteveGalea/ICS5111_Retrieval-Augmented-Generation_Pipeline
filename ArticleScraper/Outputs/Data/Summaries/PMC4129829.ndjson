{"summary": "traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely perceived in western societies that TCM may only be effective to treat chronic diseases. the aim of this article is to provide some scientific evidence regarding the application of TCM in emergency medicine. traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been developed and used against diseases which include acute and urgent illness[2\u20135] for thousands of years. the practice of combining TCM and biomedicine has become a popular medical practice particularly in TCM hospitals to be used against a range of acute and urgent illnesses. Huangdi Nei Jing (emperor's Canon of Medicine) was written between 770BCE and 200BCE. it establishes the basic theoretical framework of TCM such as: Zang Xiang Xue Shuo (viscera doctrine), Yin Yang Wu Xing Xue Shuo (the theory of yin-yang and the five elements), and Jing Luo Xue Shuo (meridian theory). Yin Yang Xiao Xi (yearly variation of yin and yang) and Wu De Zhuan Yi (transfer of five virtues) of naturalists to the theory of yin-yang and five elements of TCM;[8] and from Zhong Yong Zhi Dao (the doctrine of the mean Confucian\u2014the harmony between human beings) of Confucianism to the harmony among Zang Fu (the viscera), Qi two masters deserve the most credit in developing theoretical framework of TCM for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. one is Ye Tian Shi, who wrote Wen Re Run and developed Wei Qi Ying Xue Bian Zheng (the differentiation of wei-qi-ying-xue syndromes) another is Wu Ju Tong, who wrote Wen Bing Tiao Bian (the differentiation of sanjiao syndromes) traditional Chinese emergency medicine was published in 1995. some well developed affiliated hospitals of TCM universities have been equipped with the state-of-the-art equipments. acupuncture was introduced to western countries in the 1970s. the eight Therapeutic Methods of TCM treatment is based on the differentiation of syndromes. subjects include: Huangdi Nei Jing, Shanghan Lun, Jin Kui Yao Lue, wen Bing Xue, wen Bing Xue, wen Bing Xue, wen. Xue, wen. Xue, wen. Xue, wen. Xue, wen. X the differences in epistemology and methodology define fundamental differences in categories of illness studies between biomedicine and TCM. in biomedicine, disease is the basic unit of illness study and therefore treatment is based on the disease, but in TCM, syndrome is the basic unit of illness study and therefore treatment is based on differentiation of syndromes. the patient is under 24-hour monitoring of ECG. the treatment with TCM alone is satisfactory if the patient has no major complications such as heart failure and ventricular fibrillation. herbal formulas such as Bai Hu Tang,[9] Gui Zhi Tang,[9] Ma Huang Tang,[9] and Yin Qiao San[7] are effective in controlling viruses. the drip was given once a day for 5 days, as a course of treatment. the complication rate after the treatment was 9.5% but all cases recovered, whereas in 63 controls, 3 died. traditional herbal prescriptions of TCM for acute severe illness Da Xian Xiong Tang were added. it consists of rhubarb, mirabilite, peach seed, and kansui root. only 2 patients died from the disease. this formula was also used to treat 47 patients with EHF. seventeen of these were cases of 1\u20132 day onset illness. all of these were free of shock and oliguria stages and directly entered diuresis stage. the basic TCM theory was generated by the involvement of ancient Chinese philosophies such as the Taoist school, Confucianism, Huang-Lao doctrines. the basic TCM theory was generated by the involvement of ancient Chinese philosophies such as the Taoist school, Confucianism, Huang-Lao doctrines (to name a few but not limited to this) Zhang Zhongjing's main contributions to TCM are: first, establishment of Bian Zheng Lun Zhi, differentiation of six-channel syndromes, and second, establishment of the Eight Therapeutic Methods. in line with the therapeutic method, 269 herbal prescriptions were recorded in his books. first four TCM universities were established in 1956, with every province later getting their own TCM universities. traditional Chinese emergency medicine (TCEM) has started to catch up. emergency medicine matches the level of biomedicine only hospitals in china. acupuncture was introduced to western countries in the 1970s. however, it can be problematic by only accepting the practical part of acupuncture without bothering to know the theoretical part of TCM. fundamental differences in methodology between TCM and biomedicine. differences in epistemology and methodology define fundamental differences in categories of illness studies between biomedicine and TCM. treatment is based on the disease, but in TCM, syndrome is the basic unit of illness study and therefore treatment is based on differentiation of syndromes. however, it is limited when diseases have either a pathogenous mechanism that is unknown or the agent to break down the circle of pathogen is unfound. it is also limited when illness is related to functional defects or diseases with multiple organ, tissue, or system defects. herbal formulas such as Bai Hu Tang,[9] Gui Zhi Tang,[9] Ma Huang Tang,[9] and Yin Qiao San[7] are effective in controlling viruses. underlying mechanism of this effect may be partially related to the immunomodulatory effects of the formulas on viral infectious diseases. authors concluded that TCM intervention could effectively control or alleviate the symptoms of the disease and prevent the disease from exacerbation. the drip was given once a day for 5 days, as a course of treatment. all cases recovered, whereas in 63 controls, 3 died. the outcome of combined medicine was better than that of biomedicine alone. rhubarb, mirabilite, peach seed, and kansui root were used to treat 112 patients with EHF complicated by high blood volume syndrome. only 2 patients died from the disease. the study indicated the importance of early use of this formula. it seems that the practice of combined medicine shows a more synergetic clinical outcome, rather than \u201cinteraction between drugs\u201d. it is possible to apply the combined medicine to a wide range of diseases."}
