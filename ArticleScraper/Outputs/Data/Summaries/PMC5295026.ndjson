{"summary": "sevenband grouper (Hyporthodus septemfasciatus) is one of the favorite grouper fish consumed. viral nervous necrosis (VNN) causes high mortality, especially at larval and juvenile stage of sevenband groupers during the summer season. betanodaviruses have five genogroups based on the T4 region sequence of RNA2 as barfin flounder nervous necrosis virus (BFNNV), red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV), tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus (TPNNV) and turbot nervous necrosis virus. rapid progress has been made in next generation sequencing (NGS) technology and we obtained differential expression genes between sevenband grouper brain infected by NNV and non-infected sevenband grouper brain. our transcriptome analysis data will provide valuable genomic information to determine the functional roles of these genes related to NNV infection and VNN outbreak. Virus Challenge Twenty fish (mean body weight, 20 g) were reared in two 40 L tanks (n = 10/tank) at 25 \u00b0C. ten fish were intramuscularly injected with NNV at doses of 103.8 TCID50/fish. the remaining 10 fish were injected with L15 medium as a control. the function of unigenes was predicted by Blastx to search all possible proteins against the NCBI Non-redundant database. the criterion regarding significance of the similarity was set at Expect-value less than 1 105. a GO based trend test was carried out through the Fisher\u2019s exact test. brain tissues of 10 fish were randomly sampled from the aqua-farm. brain tissue of three of ten challenged fish from mock and the virus-challenge group were collected. transcriptome data of sevenband grouper, complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were prepared for 100 bp paired-end sequencing using a TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit. paired-end sequences were filtered and cleaned using an NGS QC toolkit [21] to remove low quality reads (Q 20) and adapter sequences. the DEGs were identified based on the p-value of less than 0.05. a trend test was carried out through the Fisher\u2019s exact test. Selected genes with p-values of less than 1 105 were statistically significant. 66,204 unigenes (63.4%) were no more than 500 bp. a total of 15,382 unigenes (14.7%) were 501\u20131000 bp, 6991 unigenes (6.7%) were 1001\u20131500 bp, 4727 unigenes (4.5%) were 1001\u20131500 bp, 3332 unigenes (3.2%) were 2001\u20132500 bp. Ubiquitin-like protein 4a (UBL4a), C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2), lysozyme g (LYG_EPICO) were highly expressed in the NNV-infected group compared to that in the mock group. of them, Ubiquitin-like protein 4a was the most abundant gene in the NNV-infected group. ribosomal protein L39 SGU036307 CCL2 C-C motif chemokine 2 11 SGU021087 UBIQP_XENLA Polyubiquitin SGU053409 LYG_EPICO Lysozyme g 12 SGU002473 RPS28 40S ribosomal protein S28 13 SGU002418 FABP7 Fatty acid-binding protein. 43,280 sequences (41.5%) of 104,348 unigenes sequences were identified. 372 genes from the total of 3418 DEGs were annotated. in immune relevant genes, a variety of cytokines were up-regulated after NNV infection. 8 C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 8 (Interleukin-8) 6.7 1307.0 7.61 2.7 104 6.4 102 EBI3 Interleukin-27 Subunit Beta 9.2 1506.8 7.36 3.4 104 7.5 102 CXCL9 C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 9 12.5 1438.8 6.85 6.4 104 1.2 101 CCL4 C-C Motif Chemokine 4 1 hepsin H 418.3 9396.3 4.49 1.1 102 7.5 101 CTSK Cathepsin K 170.0 8802.5 5.69 2.3 103 2.7 101 CTSO Cathepsin O 20.0 485.0 4.60 1.4 102 8.6 101 CTSS Cathepsin S 388.3 20,089.4 5.69 2.2 103 2.7 101 CTSZ Cathepsin Z 604.2 10,606.8 4.13 1.8 102 9.8 subunit C 61.7 4210.0 6.09 1.4 103 2.0 101 C1S Complement C1s Subcomponent 126.4 8272.5 6.03 1.4 103 2.0 101 C1QB Complement C1q Subcomponent Subunit B 116.7 7135.2 5.93 1.7 103 2.2 101 C7 Complement Component C7 30.0 1288.2 5.42 3.9 103 3.8 101 CFB Complement Factor B 144.2 4880.0 5.08 5.3 103 4.6 101 851.1 10.61 5.6 106 7.1 103 HERC6 E3 Ubiquitin-protein Ligase Herc6 65.0 34,045.8 9.03 2.2 105 1.6 102 USP18 Ubiquitin Carboxyl-terminal Hydrolase 18 14.2 4250.9 8.23 8.4 105 3.0 102 USP12 Ubiquitin Carboxyl-terminal Hydrolase 12 9.2 1986.2 7.76 1.9 104 5.4 e Motif-containing Protein 16 17.5 476.7 4.77 1.2 102 7.7 101 TRIM14 Tripartite Motif-containing Protein 14 85.7 1728.9 4.33 1.5 102 8.9 101 Others RSAD2 Radical S-adenosyl Methionine Domain-containing Protein 2 30.8 41,672.6 10.40 3.4 106 7.1 103 IFI44 Interferon-induced Protein 44 62.8 73,980.2 10.20 4.3 rile Alpha Motif Domain-containing Protein 9 2.5 1271.2 8.99 6.5 105 2.8 102 IRF4 Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 10.0 2811.3 8.14 1.1 104 3.6 102 GVINP1 Interferon-induced Very Large GTPase 1 53.3 11,420.6 7.74 1.4 104 4.5 102 TMEM173 Stimulator of Interferon Genes Protein 23.3 4917.5 7.72 1.6 104 4.8 feron-induced Helicase C Domain-containing Protein 1 96.7 5280.5 5.77 2.1 103 2.6 101 PSMB8 Proteasome Subunit Beta Type-8 86.7 3997.5 5.53 3.0 103 3.2 101 GRN Granulins 275.0 11,720.0 5.41 3.3 103 3.3 101 MR1 Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I-related Gene Protein 153.6 6162.8 5.33 3.8 103 3.6 101 SOCS3 Suppressor Of Cy subtypes L, H, K, O, S and Z were up-regulated in the brain of sevenband grouper after NNV infection. a number of antiviral proteins also showed high levels of expression in the infected group. a lot of IFN-induced proteins were up-regulated by NNV infection.

CCL2 was the most critically expressed gene in the infected group. subtypes L, H, K, O, S and Z were up-regulated in the brain of sevenband grouper. antiviral proteins also showed high levels of expression in the NNV-infected group. a lot of IFN-induced proteins were upregulated by NNV infection. a lot of IFN-induced proteins were upregulated by NNV infection. GO analysis of the transcriptome revealed nine molecular function subcategories, 62 biological process subcategories, and 12 cellular component subcategories with p value of less than 1 105). discussion NNV infection has caused high mortalities of sevenband groupers in aqua-farms during the summer season, especially at larval and juvenile stages. gene annotation by BlastX provides valuable information about the transcripts. 43,289 unigenes (41.5%) of 104,348 unigenes were annotated. this is similar to result of orange-spooted grouper (45.8%) cathepsins are one of the superfamilies involved in the regulation of antigen presentation and degradation as well as immune responses. they are involved in the entry of reovirus [50] and in the process of fusion glycoprotein of Hendra virus. IFI44 is an interferon-alpha inducible protein associated with infection of several viruses. Carlton-Smith and Elliott have screened ISGs related to Bunyamwera orthbunyavirus replication using nonstructural (NSs) protein knock out virus. one of these ISGs that have inhibitory activity is found to be IFI44. a microarray can only evaluate the genes on a chip. results have not yet been confirmed by an independent technique such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)"}
