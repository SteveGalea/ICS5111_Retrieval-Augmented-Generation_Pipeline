{"summary": "high risk human papilloma virus (HPV) confirmed as dominant factor responsible for several anogenital diseases, particularly cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinoma (1). HPV58 is the third most common high-risk HPV genotype found in Chinese cervical carcinoma patients after HPV16 and 18 (5). the cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope of the HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins match human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2. the immunogenicity of these epitope has been confirmed using transgenic mice (11). in vitro, lymphocytes from human peripheral blood previously immunized with the HPV16 polypeptide vaccine induced specific CTL immune responses and killed HPV16-positive tumor cells (12,13). the predicted peptides each containing nine amino acid were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis and purified by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. the mass of each peptide was 30 mg and the purity of exceeded 93%. the cells were added 100 U/ml interleukin 2 every other day. three times of stimulation by the peptides and IL-2, the PBMC were detected special immune spots by an ELISPOT kit. a 96-well nitrocellulose plate precoated with anti-human interferon antibody was placed at 4\u00b0C overnight. the unbound secondary antibody was removed by washing with scrubbing solution. the plate was washed and air dried for 24 h. the responses were considered positive when predicted peptides stimulation was above 50 SFC/well. the peptide HPV58 E772-80 was used as antigen to activate the immunized mice serum and splenocytes before ELISA and ELISPOT assay. a 96-well nitrocellulose plate precoated with anti-mice IFN- antibody was placed at 4\u00b0C overnight and then blocked the following day with 10% FBS. o-9-ethylcarbazole substrate solution was carried out for 20 min. the plate was washed and air dried for 24 h. the immune spots indicated that the peptide HPV58 E772-80 can activate the mice splenocytes immumed by the AD-HPV16/18/58 mE6E7 vaccine. the predicted peptides each containing nine amino acid were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis and purified by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. the mass of each peptide was 30 mg and the purity of exceeded 93%. the cells were added 100 U/ml interleukin 2 every other day. three times of stimulation by the peptides and IL-2, the PBMC were detected special immune spots. a 96-well nitrocellulose plate precoated with anti-human interferon (IFN) antibody was placed at 4\u00b0C overnight. the immune spots represented individual IFN-producing cells as spot-forming cells (SFC) on the membrane. the responses were considered positive when predicted peptides stimulation was above 50 SFC/well compared with the responses obtained with all the negative control peptide. mE6E7 vaccine was individually administered by tattooing on day 7, 14 and 21. the peptide HPV58 E772-80 was used as antigen to activate the immunized mice serum and splenocytes. a 96-well nitrocellulose plate precoated with anti-mice IFN- antibody was placed at 4\u00b0C overnight. the peptide HPV58 E772-80 can activate the mice splenocytes immumed by the AD-HPV16/18/58 mE6E7 vaccine containing HPV58E7 gene. the responses were considered positive when the spot numbers produced in AD-HPV16/18/58 mE6E7 group were above 50 SFC/well. the predicted peptides each containing nine amino acid were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis and purified by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. the mass of each peptide was 30 mg and the purity of exceeded 93%. the cells were stimulated with 10 g/ml of the six predicted peptides or negative control peptide, respectively. the cells were added 100 U/ml interleukin 2 every other day. three times of stimulation by the peptides and IL-2, the PBMC were detected special immune spots. the unbound secondary antibody was removed by washing with scrubbing solution. the plate was washed and air dried for 24 h. the immune spots represented individual IFN--producing cells as spot-forming cells (SFC) on the membrane. 58 mE6E7 vaccine was individually administered by tattooing on day 7, 14 and 21 after the cancer cells challenge. peptide HPV58 E772-80 was used as antigen to activate the immunized mice serum and splenocytes before ELISA and ELISPOT assay. the peptide HPV58 E772-80 can activate the mice splenocytes immumed by the AD-HPV16/18/58 mE6E7 vaccine containing HPV58E7 gene. the responses were considered positive when the spots produced in AD-HPV16/18/58 mE6E7 group were above 50 SFC/well.

IFN--positive spots were detected in the PHA, P2 and P4 groups. other experimental groups and the two negative control groups showed no or few spots formation. the average number of IFN--positive spots in the PHA, P2 and P4 groups was 73717.54 SFC/1105, 50.615.37 SFC/1105, 26634.42 SFC/1105, respectively. the spot numbers in these three groups were significantly higher than other experiment groups and the two negative control groups. antibody titers of vaccine group were 1:25,600, but the antibody titers of PBS group and AD-NC group were 1:400.

Table I. Prediction results for HPV58 E7 epitopes. IFN--positive spots were detected in the PHA, P2 and P4 groups. other experimental groups and the two negative control groups showed no or few spots formation. the average number of IFN--positive spots in the PHA, P2 and P4 groups was 73717.54 SFC/1105.

HPV58 E772-80 peptide can activate humoral immunogenicity of mice immunized by the vaccine containing HPV58E7 antigen. the splenocytes from the immunized mice were tested directly ex vivo in IFN- Elispot assays against the HPV58 E772-80 peptide. the average number of IFN--positive spots was 14332.13 SFC/1105. the positive spots were significantly increased compared with those of control mice immunized with the vaccine containing HPV58 E772-80 antigen. the peptide HPV58 E772-80 was added to 96-well plate as stimulation antigen. the serum of mice immunized with PBS, AD-NC, and AD-HPV16/18/58 mE6E7 vaccine was added to 96-well plate. ELISA was completed, the absorbance of each hole of 96 holes was detected. the antibody titers of the AD-HPV16/18/58 mE6E7 vaccine group were significantly increased *P0.05 vs. the PBS group and #P0.05 vs. the AD-NC group. the average number of IFN--positive spots was 143.332.13 SFC/1105 in the AD-HPV16/18/58 mE6E7 vaccine group. positive spots were significantly enhanced compared with those of control mice immunized with PBS group (85.29 SFC/1105), or AD-NC empty vector group (285.13 SFC/1105). cellular immunity mediated by CTL plays a key role in cancer immunity. effector T cells mainly recognize CTL epitopes that are bound to MHC-I molecules to induce cytotoxic cytotoxicity (16). HLA-I molecules are key to antigen presentation and activation of T cells. the HPV E6 and E7 antigens were screened by acid elution or the use of synthetic overlapping peptides. however, the methods can result in a high miss rate because four to eight amino acid residues are separated by two overlapping peptide segments. the average number of IFN--positive spots in groups P2 and P4 was significantly increased compared to other four experiment groups and the two negative control groups. we chose P4 (E772-80: STTTDVRTL) to continue our study. HPV58 E772-80 is a HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope peptide and has good antigenicity. this result provided a potential target epitope for HPV58 E7 protein."}
