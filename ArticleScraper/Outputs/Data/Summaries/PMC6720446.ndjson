{"summary": "epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are given as standard therapy to non-small cell lung cancer patients who carry activating mutations in the EGFR gene. the EGFR-TKI gefitinib significantly improved response and survival. 40% of patients treated with EGFR-TKI experience severe adverse events. EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the ErbB receptor family. it regulates multiple aspects of pulmonary epithelial cell homeostasis in response to injury. EGFR and other ErbB family members can be activated by direct interaction with EGF-like ligands. this initiates receptor dimerization and increased kinase activity. TNF regulates both anti- and pro-apoptotic signal transduction pathways. pro-apoptotic TNF induced pathways include p38 MAPK and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are released. EGFR-TKI may enhance the development of lung injury in TNF-overexpressing lung tissue. we used surfactant protein C (SPC)-TNF transgenic (tg) mice, in which the TNF- gene was placed under the control of the transcriptional promoter of the SPC gene. TNF was expressed in the lungs of these mice, producing alveolitis, alveolar disruption, and progressive pulmonary fibrosis. litis resembles many aspects of human severe emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. mRNA expression profile of wildtype (WT) vs surfactant protein C-tumor necrosis factor transgenic (SPC-TNF tg) mouse lung tissue was quantified by real-time PCR. there was no change in body weight in either WT or SPC-TNF tg mice. mRNA levels for the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 were significantly increased. no inflammation and lung injury was observed. the data are represented relative to control values, as means SEM (n = 8). the data are represented relative to control values, as means SEM (n = 8). 0.1 0.057 0.8 0.1 0.16 Egfr 1 1.0 0.1 0.94 1.0 0.2 0.87 Table 3. Cytokine mRNA expression profile of surfactant protein C-tumor necrosis factor transgenic (SPC-TNF tg) mouse lung tissue with gefitinib 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg for 14 days. indocyanine green (ICG)-loaded liposomes were labeled with sialyl Lewis X (SLX) on the surface (SLX-Lipo-ICG) these liposomes could accumulate in the regions of inflammation or tumor owing to the interaction of SLX and E-selectin, which enhanced E-selectin expression by inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF. cyanine green (ICG)-loaded liposomes were used to detect regions of inflammation in whole lungs of (a) wildtype (WT) and (b) SPC-TNF tg mice after daily gefitinib (100 mg/kg) treatment for 14 days. images were captured using the Clairvivo OPT in vivo imaging system. apoptosis may be induced by p38 MAPK pathways via MAP kinase kinase kinase (MKK) 3/6. gefitinib enhanced lung epithelial cell apoptosis via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. the percentages of positive cells are shown in the control lung tissues of WT and SPC-TNF tg (f), and in the SPC-TNF tg mice where both a control and gefitinib were administered (g). p 0.05 compared with WT (f), or control (g), Student\u2019s t-test. EGFR phosphorylation was initiated from 15 min after TNF exposure. TNF-induced EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited by gefitinib. exposing beAS-2B cells simultaneously with TNF and gefitinib, enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis. B cells were treated with gefitinib (1 M) for 1 h, and then treated with either EGF (10 ng/mL) or TNF (100 ng/mL) for 15 min. band intensity of phosphorylated EGFR (P-EGFR) was quantified and determined using the ImageJ software (NIH) pathway TACE facilitates the shedding of EGFR ligands. TAPI-1 suppressed TNF-induced EGFR phosphorylation, but not EGF-stimulation. TAPI-1 enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis significantly. beAS-2B cells were treated with TAPI-1 (10 M), a TNF- converting enzyme (TACE) inhibitor, for 1 h, and then treated with either TNF (100 ng/mL) or epithelial growth factor (EGF, 10 ng/mL) cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies. -actin was included as a loading control. FITC- and DAPI- labeled images were taken from same field. percentages of apoptotic cells were determined out of at least 500 cells. knockdown of tACE using siRNA reduced the amount of HB-EGF and TGF- in the culture supernatant. these results indicate that the expression of HB-EGF and TGF- in the culture supernatant was regulated by TACE. these ligands were involved in TNF-induced transactivation in BEAS-2B cells. band intensity of phosphorylated EGFR (P-EGFR) was quantified using the ImageJ software (NIH) beas-2B cells were treated with TNF (100 ng/mL) for 15 min with or without pretreatment (1 h) with neutralizing antibodies against TGF- (10 g/mL) and HB-EGF (10 g/mL) EGFR tyrosine kinase activity protects lung tissue from inflammatory cytokine storms. mice have lymphocytic and fibrosing alveolitis, which resemble many aspects of human severe emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. administration of gefitinib resulted in severe lymphocytic infiltration in the alveolar septa. in wild type (WT) mice, administration of gefitinib resulted in severe lymphocytic infiltration in the alveolar septa. there was also no death related to gefitinib administration. the scale bars represent 500 m and 100 m for 40 and 200 magnification. the mRNA transcripts were quantified by real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH. 0.4 0.2 0.093 Tgfb1 1 0.93 0.0 0.076 0.97 0.0 0.34 Foxp3 1 1.6 0.1 0.0001 1.6 0.1 0.0051 Gata3 1 0.99 0.1 0.97 0.6 0.1 0.0015 Tbet 1 0.82 0.1 0.017 0.5 0.1 0.0012 Gm-csf 1 0.80 0.1 0.057 0.8 0.1 0.16 Egfr 1 1.0 0.1 0.94 1.0 fb1 1 1.2 0.1 0.0042 1.9 0.2 0.003 Foxp3 1 0.9 0.0 0.24 1.1 0.2 0.042 Gata3 1 1.0 0.1 0.69 0.8 0.0 0.0001 Tbet 1 1.1 0.0 0.32 1.2 0.2 0.49 Gm-csf 1 0.7 0.0 0.0001 1.1 0.1 0.22 Egfr 1 1.1 0.1 0.53 1.1 0.0 0.14 2.2. EGFR tyrosine kinase activity protects mice from TNF-induced lung inflammation in mice model. results suggest that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity protects mice from TNF-induced lung inflammation in mice. EGFR tyrosine kinase activity was significantly inhibited in SPC-TNF tg mice after gefitinib administration. phosphorylation of downstream signals AKT and ERK1/2 also decreased in SPC-TNF tg mice. anti-apoptotic responses can be mediated by AKT, ERK1/2, or Raf. the scale bar represents 200 m and 100 m for 100 and 200 magnification. the percentages of positive cells are shown in the control lung tissues of WT and SPC-TNF tg. beas-2B cells were exposed to TNF (100 ng/mL) from 1 to 240 min. stimulation of EGFR phosphorylation was initiated from 15 min after TNF exposure. TNF-induced EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited by gefitinib. lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies after the following treatments. -actin was included as a loading control. beas-2B cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of TNF for 15 min. p 0.05, Student\u2019s t-test, compared with the control. TNF transactivates EGFR through TACE and Regulates Cell-Survival via the PI3-Kinase/AKT Pathway TACE facilitates the shedding of EGFR ligands. TAPI-1 enhances tumor necrosis factor-induced lung epithelial cell apoptosis. beAS-2B cells were cultured and serum-starved for 16 h prior to treatment unless otherwise indicated (a\u2013d) cells were treated with TNF (100 ng/mL) for 8 h in the presence or absence of a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, U0126 (10 M), or a PI3 kinase (P13K) inhibitor, wortmannin (1 M). cells were fixed for TUNEL assay, with apoptotic nuclei labeled with FITC (green) and nuclei labeled with DAPI the combination of neutralizing antibodies against HB-EGF and TGF- showed remarkable inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation in the presence of TNF. HB-EGF and TGF- expression in the culture supernatant increased upon TNF exposure. however, the presence of TAPI-1 reduced the expression of these EGFR-ligands. beAS-2B cells were treated with TNF (100 ng/mL) for 15 min with or without pretreatment with control antibody (control-IgG) or anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (10 g/mL) for 1 h. band intensity of phosphorylated EGFR (P-EGFR) was quantified and determined using the ImageJ software (NIH) beas-2B cells were cultured on collagen-coated dishes. they were transfected with N/T siRNA or TACE for 72 h. the cell lysates were collected and protein levels of TACE were determined by Western blot analysis. EGFR is overexpressed and activated in response to lung epithelial injury. increased amounts of both TGF- and EGFR have been observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with acute lung injury. further studies are required to discover the role of EGFR and its ligands in inflammatory lung diseases. the sugar chain sialyl Lewis X (SLX) is well characterized as an E-selectin ligand. SLX-liposomes targeting E-selectin deliver and accumulate their ICG content in regions of inflammation and within tumors. IL-17A was the most significantly increased cytokine after gefitinib treatment in SPC-TNF tg mice. cytokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 in mouse mesangial cells. gefitinib treatment led to increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. IL-17A may stimulate p38 MAPK activity and induce lung epithelial cell apoptosis. pneumonitis is most common cause of death related to EGFR TKI toxicity. phosphorylation by stimulating TGF- and HB-EGF via TACE activity. this EGFR transactivation by TNF regulates cell survival. the effects reported are based on SPC-TNF tg mice. materials used for western blot analysis were from Bio-Rad Laboratories. all pharmacological inhibitors and agonists were dissolved in DMSO. all pharmacological inhibitors and agonists were added to the medium with a final DMSO concentration of 0.1%. ted on ice for 20 min and clarified by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min) protein content in the supernatant was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method. gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl, pH the relative gene expressions were calculated according to the 2-Ct method. control values were expressed as 1 [49]. 4.6.
