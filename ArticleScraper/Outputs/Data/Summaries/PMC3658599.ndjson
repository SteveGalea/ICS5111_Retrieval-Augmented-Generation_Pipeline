{"summary": "IBV is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Coronavirus, group 3 (gamma coronaviruses) it is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the genus Coronavirus, group 3 (gamma coronaviruses) it can be nephropathogenic and cause infection of the reproductive system. only homologous protection has been achieved against CK/CH/LDL/97I. in the middle east, the common circulating IBV strains are mass serotype vaccine isolates, H120 serotype vaccine isolates, D274 [14], IBV variant 1 strains (793/B, IS/222/96, IS/251/96, and IS/64714/96) by the end of 2009, variant 2 and variant 2-like strains appeared in Jordan and in northern Iraq. RT-PCR amplification was performed with a thermal profile of 94\u00b0C for 45 sec, 60\u00b0C (first step) and 53\u00b0C (second step) for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 2 min for 40 cycles. IBV primer Sequence 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 Position in S1 sequence Reference SX1 CACCTAGAGGTTTG T/C T A/T GCAT 677 to 698A SX2 TCCACCTCTATAAACACC C/T TT 1148 to 1168. amplification was performed using the GenePro thermal cycler (Bioer, China) the nucleotide sequence identities were prepared using CLUSTAL W in the MEGALIGN Programme of the Lasergene software. the samples were collected from suspected IBV outbreaks in Iraq, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. the samples were stored at 70\u00b0C in RNAlater solution (Qiagen, Germany) the diagnostic N gene amplification was done in a final volume of 25 L GoTaq Green master mix (Promega, USA) the final concentration of the N gene primers was 0.5 mmol. amplification was performed with a thermal profile of 94\u00b0C for 45 sec, 60\u00b0C (first step) and 53\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 2 min for 40 cycles. annealing temperature for both RT-PCR steps was 50\u00b0C. gene RT-PCR products were sequenced using an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyser at the Princess Haya Biotechnology Centre. aligned sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis. clinical findings Vaccine used chicken/age JOA4 Trachea, ovary Drop in egg production H120 Watery cysts in ovaries M41 Layer, 24 weeks Short and enlarged oviducts 4/91 JOA2 Trachea, kidney, ovary Drop in egg production H120, M41, 4/91 Layer, 22 weeks Saudi-1 Trachea Respiratory signs H120, 4/91 Broiler, 22 days Saudi-2 Trachea Respiratory signs H120, 4 the CK/CH/LDL/97I strain is known to be endemic in China and Taiwan. the CK/CH/LDL/97I strain is known to be endemic in china and Taiwan. the CK/CH/LDL/97I and CK/CH/SCYA/10I strains shared 99.1% and 99.4% nucleotide identity to the CK/CH/LDL/97I and CK/CH/SCYA/10I strains. the CK/CH/LDL/97I and CK/CH/SCYA/10I strains shared 99.1% and 100% nucleotide identity to the CK/CH/LDL/97I and CK phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the alignment of the partial S1 sequence. all five IBV isolates were grouped with CK/CH/LDL/97I, CK/CH/SCYA/10I, J2 and Q1 in one group. nucleotide identity of these five isolates to the IBV vaccine strains in the three countries (M41, H120, and 4/91) were in the range of 78\u201382.1%, to variant 1 IBV the CK/CH/LDL/97I-like strain was first isolated in china in 1995. it was isolated from the tracheas of infected chickens. the strain showed slight variability in the partial S1 sequence."}
