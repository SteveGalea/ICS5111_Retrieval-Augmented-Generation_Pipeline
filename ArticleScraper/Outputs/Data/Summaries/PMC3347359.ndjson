{"summary": "the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) belong to the superfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which also includes p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) the inhibition of JNK has been shown to impair liver cell proliferation and tumor development, suggesting the potential use of these inhibitors as therapeutic agents for HCC (42). apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces cytotoxicity (51) treatment with a JNK inhibitor (JNKi) (SP600125) sensitizes HCC cells to TRAIL, providing evidence that the activity of JNK is required for resistance to apoptosis in these tumors. the aberrant activation of JNK is an important feature of many disparate viruses. immortalized human hepatocytes were maintained in DMEM\u2013F-12 medium. primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were derived from patients who underwent surgical resections of liver tumors. wild-type VSV-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated as previously described. single infections and one-step growth curves of recombinant VSV (rVSV)-GFP were performed on PHH, immortalized human hepatocytes (PH5CH8) and the HepG2 and Huh-7 cell lines. cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 or 10 according to the experiment. chemicals (SB203580 [10 M], SP600125 [25 M], and U0126 [10 M] were purchased from Calbiochem-Merck (Gibbstown, NJ) for experiments with the JNK inhibitor, Huh-7 cells were pretreated with SP600125 (25 M), and infection was allowed to proceed either in the absence or in the presence of fresh inhibitor. a 138-nucleotide DNA fragment spanning one intergenic region between the N and P genes was designed. quantitative real-time PCR was carried out with the QuantiTect Probe reverse transcription kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR Fast LightCycler 480 kit (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany) using 15 ng of the template. one microgram of plasmid was transfected into Huh-7 cells by using Lipofectamine LTX. at 8 h posttransfection, the supernatant was replaced with fresh medium containing DMSO or SP600125 (25 M) the presence of SP600125 did not influence transfection efficiency rates. purified VSV obtained from SP600125-treated cells was separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. Viral proteins were stained with the Coomassie staining method. gel pieces were digested with trypsin and separated by using a reversed-phase LC column. two human hepatocytes were maintained in DMEM\u2013F-12 medium. immortalized human hepatocytes (PHH) were derived from patients who underwent surgical resection of liver tumors. membranes were blotted with the following primary antibodies (Abs) overnight at 4\u00b0C. antibodies against basal and phosphorylated forms of JNK, ERK1 and -2. antibodies against basal and phosphorylated forms of JNK, ERK1 and -2. cells were seeded at 80 to 90% confluence in 24-well plates overnight. the next morning, the culture media were replaced with fresh media containing dimethyl sulfoxide or MAPK inhibitors at the indicated concentrations. virus infections were carried out in the presence of freshly added inhibitors. cells were infected with rVSV-GFP; cell supernatants and cell lysates were collected at the indicated time points. cell debris was eliminated by centrifugation and total RNA was extracted. uninfected duplicate cultures were analyzed by Western blotting. cells were treated with SP600125 or DMSO and infected with VSV. one microgram of plasmid was transfected into Huh-7 cells. virions obtained from DMSO- or SP600125-treated cells were subjected to digestion with endoglycosidase F (PNGase F) or with endo--N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EndoGalNAcase) samples were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C, according to manufacturer's instructions. mass accuracy settings were 0.15 Da for peptide masses and 0.12 Da for fragment ion masses. data were analyzed by using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) individual data points were compared by applying a two-sided Student t test. in HCC cells, the phosphorylation of JNK is a fairly late event during VSV infection. infection with a UV-inactivated virus did not induce JNK activation. in contrast, p38 MAPK showed a delayed activation, occurring at 12 hpi. cells were infected with wild-type VSV at an MOI of 0.1 for 16 h. titers in the culture supernatants were determined by TCID50 analysis. to confirm the siRNA knockdown, cell lysates of parallel uninfected cultures were subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for JNK. despite a robust decrease of JNK protein levels, viral replication was not affected. despite a robust decrease of JNK protein levels, viral replication was not affected. despite a robust decrease of JNK protein levels, viral replication was not affected. the inhibition of ERK and p38 MAPK did not enhance the efficacy of IFN-/ against VSV in HCC cells. the inhibition of ERK and p38 MAPK did not enhance the efficacy of IFN-/ against VSV in HCC cells. total RNAs from cell lysates were harvested at different time points (0, 2, 4, and 8 hpi) the inhibition of JNK did not interfere with VSV mRNA transcription. levels of the VSV G protein in SP600125-treated cells were comparable to those in control samples. virions from cells treated with SP600125 are impaired in their infectivity. the number of budded viral particles was extrapolated by real-time PCR. number of copies of the VSV genome was slightly reduced upon treatment. the levels of all viral proteins in the pellet were lower than those for mock-treated cells. the loss of infectivity was not due to reduced levels of incorporation of viral G or other proteins into the budded virions. the protein profile of virions produced from cells treated with SP60025 revealed an additional major protein band. titers were determined by TCID50 analysis at the indicated time points. a reduction of VSV replication in the presence of SP600125 was clearly observed during the entire duration of the kinetic analysis. a reduction of VSV replication in the presence of SP600125 was clearly observed during the entire duration of the analysis. the anti-VSV antibody used in this experiment also detected the additional high-molecular-weight band. the fragments obtained after limited proteolysis could be identified as VSV-G protein peptides. levels of the VSV glycoprotein (G), phosphoprotein/nucleoprotein (P/N) and matrix protein (M) were detected by an anti-VSV serum. the same samples were alternatively exposed to 8 M urea and analyzed by Western blotting. 1,639.91 1,639.91 0.01 0 AGLPISPVDLSYLAPK 333\u2013342

virions were exposed to increasing concentrations of SP600125 (JNKi) for 1 h on ice. virions were cross-linked with PFA (2%) on ice for 15 min. one-tenth of the samples was preheated at 56\u00b0C for 10 min. viral glycoprotein monomers (G), dimers (G2), trimers (G3) were detected with a polyclonal antibody specific for VSV-G. the same samples were used to infect HepG2 cells. virus progeny was quantified by TCID50 analysis at 24 h postinfection. syncytium formation was quantified at 24 h posttransfection by using a syncytium index (SI) the extent of syncytium formation was quantified at 24 h posttransfection. the decrease in viral titers correlated directly with the level of expression of VSV-G* in infected cells. syncytium formation was quantified by the determination of the syncytium index (SI) parallel cultures were fixed and stained with propidium iodide (PI) to visualize syncytia. expression levels of VSV-G and VSV-G* were analyzed by Western blotting in the corresponding cell lysates. levels of phosphorylated ERK in HCC cells showed a minimal increment at around 4 to 6 hpi but remained unchanged. p38 MAPK showed a delayed activation, occurring at 12 hpi. in hCC cells, the phosphorylation of JNK is a fairly late event during VSV infection. a statistically significant decrease of viral titers in SP600125-treated cells was observed (*, P 0.05; **, P 0.01) at 72 h posttransfection, cells were infected with wild-type VSV at an MOI of 0.1 for 16 h. western blotting for phospho-JNK indicated that the JNK inhibitor specifically reduced JNK phosphorylation in VSV-infected HCC cells without interfering with ERK activation. however, ERK dephosphorylation was already present in VSV-infected cultures not treated with the JNK inhibitor. despite a robust decrease of JNK protein levels, viral replication was not affected. in all cell types, the viral titers were appreciably lower in cultures treated with the MAPK inhibitor than in cultures treated with DMSO. the inhibition of ERK and p38 MAPK did not enhance the efficacy of type I IFN-/ against VSV in HCC cells. SP600125 can synergistically enhance cell apoptosis in cancer cells (30, 37, 41) we excluded apoptosis as the cause of VSV growth attenuation by SP600125. the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK) did not block the JNK inhibitor effect on viral titers, and SP600125 did viral mRNA for the N protein (A) and genome RNA (B) were quantified by real-time PCR. results represent means of data from three independent experiments performed in duplicates. virions from cells treated with SP600125 are impaired in their infectivity. IFN-treated cells closely reflected the genome copy numbers. the number of infectious particles was significantly lower than the viral genome copy numbers in the supernatants of cells treated with SP600125. the loss of infectivity was not due to reduced levels of incorporation of viral proteins into budded virions. the difference between viral titers and genome copy numbers was significant. semipurified viruses obtained from DMSO-, SP600125 (JNKi)-, and IFN-treated cell supernatants by ultracentrifugation were used to determine VSV protein expression by Western blotting. the anti-VSV antibody used in this experiment also detected the additional high-molecular-weight band. the presumptive modified viral glycoprotein (VSV-G*) was further analyzed by mass spectrometry. Huh-7 cells were transfected with an empty vector (pCR3) or with a vector expressing the VSV glycoprotein (pCMV-VSV-G) lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using a specific anti-VSV-G antibody. levels of the VSV glycoprotein (G), phosphoprotein/nucleoprotein (P/N) and matrix protein (M) were detected by an anti-VSV serum.

VSV selectivity is achieved by exploiting molecular defects in cancer cells. the potent cytolytic properties of VSV in conjunction with its rapid replication cycle have made VSV an extremely promising candidate for oncolytic virotherapy (1, 31, 43, 52) reestablishment of a functional type I IFN response in HCC would be seriously detrimental to the therapeutic efficacy of VSV. the disruption of ERK signaling by anticancer drugs seems to be compatible with VSV therapy in HCC, at least in vitro. several small-molecule compounds inhibiting JNK kinase activity have been developed (35), and the combination of these new inhibitors with VSV virotherapy could potentially be beneficial for HCC treatment. in this report, we observed a strong activation of JNK upon the infection of HCC cell lines with VSV. as a cause of a lack of infectivity of newly formed virions, we have found that the viral particles incorporate at least two different forms of the G protein in the presence of SP600125. the same result was observed when a VSV-G protein-expressing plasmid was transfected in the presence of the JNK inhibitor. pretreatment alone with infection carried out in the absence of SP600125 resulted in reduced levels of VSV-G* and a partial recovery of viral titers. mass spectrometry analysis revealed that VSV-G* contains only peptides from the VSV G protein. in repeated experiments, we did not identify any cellular protein consistently in VSV-G* preparations, including the ones related to major posttranslational modifications. SP600125 also attenuates the growths of several viruses of different families. a very intriguing application of SP600125 could be as a treatment of viral infections that are accompanied by malignant transformation."}
