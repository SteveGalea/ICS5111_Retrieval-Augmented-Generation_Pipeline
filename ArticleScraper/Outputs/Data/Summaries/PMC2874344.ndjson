Strongly Disagree Strongly Agree 1 2 3 4 5. climate change will be the most serious issue that dominates reemergence of pathogens into new regions. reemergence of pathogens into new regions will be the most serious issue that dominates reemergence of pathogens into new regions. recombination events give rise to variants with altered pathogenic potential. many zoonotic pathogens fall into the category of generalist agents exhibiting extensive host diversity. this bacterium can successfully infect hosts ranging from domestic animals to wildlife, reptiles, fish, birds, and ticks. zoonoses in specific conditions show remarkable ability for human-to-human transmission beyond the confines of the confines. this ability was seen during a recent outbreak of plague among diamond miners in the Congo. this outbreak was initiated by an infection of a miner, which became pneumonic and resulted in 136 secondary cases of pneumonic plague and 57 deaths. zoonoses, given correct circumstances, can result in human-to-human transmission. higher mutation rates should be favored in changing environment, such as altered host immune defenses. in experimental settings, artificially increased mutation rates are often associated with lower virus titers. evolutionary changes are not always a prerequisite for viral emergence in a new host. salmonella spp. have repeatedly caused outbreaks of salmonellosis after persons have eaten uncooked eggs. an ongoing airborne Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands has raised awareness of this previously neglected zoonosis. the sexual stage of the life cycle of Toxplasma spp. occurs in cats. cats also serve as reservoir for bartonella henselae, the etiologic agent of cat-scratch fever. pet rats have recently been incriminated as the source of leptospira icterrohemoragiae infection in their owners. the market for exotic pets has greatly increased. this increase has resulted in transmission of several unusual organisms. a rapid increase in cases of african tick bite fever has been associated with travelers to sub-Saharan Africa and the eastern Caribbean. an estimated 1 million international journeys are made each day, and 700 million tourists travel on an annual basis. reduced host abundance may force vectors to seek alternative hosts. development of forests to provide rubber plantations in Malaysia has been correlated with increases in schistosomiasis (37) wildlife may modify feeding practices as a consequence of changing land use. pets can harbor ectoparasites such as ticks, fleas, and lice. travel to other countries increases the likelihood of potential zoonotic infections. travel to other countries opens a range of new potential exposures. pathogens are subjected to changes by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors. reemergence of diseases through opportunistic host switching is likely to continue as a major source of human infectious disease. strategies to improve public health have focused on improved surveillance in regions of perceived high likelihood of disease (reemergence) approaches for identification of pathogen replication in vectors are more likely to offer substantial benefits for control of zoonoses. emergence of drug resistance may result in concomitant loss of therapeutic options for these agents."}
