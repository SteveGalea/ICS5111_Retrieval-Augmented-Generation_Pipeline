{"summary": "world health organization has been notified of 2,143 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERSCoV infection. most of MERS-CoV human infections have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula. most of MERS-CoV human infections have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula. as of 31 January 2018, a total of 221 articles were retrieved, and 216 of them were written in English. the full texts of the English articles were reviewed and critically assessed. the outbreak of MERS-CoV resulted in 186 cases including 38 fatalities. the chain of transmission/hospital to hospital transmission was identified in all 186 patients with MERS-CoV infection [13,14] of the 86 healthcare institutions that had taken in patients, nosocomial transmission occurred in 12 hospitals and four clinics. a total of 36 MERS cases occurred at PTSM Hospital. a total of 26 patients developed symptoms within 14 days after exposure. the mode of transmission of MERS-CoV remains uncertain. a chest computed tomography scan showed very small, ground glass nodules in the periphery of the lungs, suggesting inhalation of airborne particles. the index case (superspreader-1) of the outbreak at the SMC was a 35-year-old man who had been exposed to the superspreader-1 at the ER. he developed a fever on may 21; his pneumonia became aggravated and tachypnea developed. a total of 25 secondary cases were detected at PTSM Hospital. superspreader-2 caused the two hospital outbreaks. the median time of incubation (8.8 days vs. 4.6 days), secondary attack rates (4.7% vs. 3.0%) and case fatality rate (28.6% vs. 63.6%) were different between the two outbreaks. a total of 83% of transmission events were due to five superspreaders. 44% of the 186 MERS cases were in-patients exposed within the hospitals. the spreaders transmitted MERS-CoV from days 1 to 11 of their illness. the spreaders had a higher viral load in sputum samples with the cycle thresholds for the upE and ORF1a genes of 22.7 vs. 27.2 and 23.7 vs. 27.9. a brief exposure of a 10-minute stay and 2 minutes of talking was enough for the transmission of MERS-CoV. the outbreak lasted for 2 months, with the government declaring a \u201cvirtual\u201d end to the epidemic. he visited a local clinic on may 12, 14 and 15. his symptoms did not improve and a new non-productive cough developed on 15th May. he was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia on may 15. a total of 36 MERS cases occurred at PTSM Hospital. 26 patients developed symptoms within 14 days after exposure. the remaining 10 patients may be second-generation cases. the index case for the outbreak at the PTSM Hospital was a 35-year-old man who had been exposed to the superspreader-1 at the ER. he developed a fever on may 21. despite antibiotic treatment, his pneumonia became aggravated and tachypnea developed. on may 29, the CDC found he was staying at the ER. the index case (superspreader-2) for the daejeon outbreak was infected at PTSM Hospital. he developed symptoms on may 20 and was admitted to daechung Hospital on may 22. as his pneumonia progressed, he was transferred to geonyang Hospital on may 28. defining epidemiological characteristics were superspreading events at hospitals. a total of 83% of transmission events were due to five superspreaders. 44% of the 186 MERS cases were in-patients who had been exposed within the hospitals. the spreaders had a higher frequency of fever ( 38.5\u00b0C) and chest infiltrates in more than three lung zones, and longer non-isolated in-hospital days. the spreaders had higher viral load in sputum samples with the cycle thresholds for the upE and ORF1a genes. genome sequence study also reported deletions of 414 and 419 nucleotides between ORF5 and the E protein, suggesting that the virus might be defective in its ability to package MERS CoV. a microevolution study found no evidence of changes in the evolutionary rate. the whole genome sequences of the MERS-CoV isolates were reported [26,40-43]. the virus most similar to the Korean isolates was a camel virus (Camel/Riyadh/Ry159/2015) that belonged to lineage 5. a phylogenetic study of spike glycoprotein genes also showed the Korean strains were closely related to the viral strains from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. titers were higher in throat samples than in nasopharyngeal samples. nasopharyngeal samples showed higher viral loads were associated with severity and mortality. seroconversion rates increased with the increase of disease severity. in 19.4%, nausea or vomiting in 14.0%, and abdominal pain in 8.1% of patients. cough and sputum were not prominent even in patients who later developed overt pneumonia. at admission, 68% (123/180) of patients had abnormalities on chest radiographs, while 80.8% (147/182) of them developed the abnormalities during the course of the disease. sputum and tracheal aspirates have higher viral loads than upper respiratory-tract samples. patients suspected of having MERS-CoV infection should be retested using a lower respiratory-tract sample. antiviral treatment guideline published by the writing committee with support from the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases and the Korean Society for Chemotherapy. risk factors for mortality and prognosis The median duration of fever was 8 days. median time to negative conversion of MERS-CoV in sputum samples by rRT-PCR was 17 days (range, 4 to 45) median time from symptom onset to death was 14 days. 7.6% of 1,656 patients who were quarantined showed symptoms of anxiety. 6.4% reported feelings of anger during the 2 weeks of quarantine. a case of transfusion-related acute lung injury was also reported. acute kidney injury (AKI) developed in 14.0% of the patients, 42.7% (44/103) had proteinuria, 35.0% (36/103) had hematuria. acute kidney injury (AKI) developed in 14.0% of the patients, 42.7% (44/103) had proteinuria, and 35.0% (36/103) had hematuria. the guidelines for the molecular diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection have been published by the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine [63,64]. Specimen type and quality is important in the laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. lower respiratory-tract samples, such as sputum and tracheal aspirates, have higher viral loads than upper respiratory-tract samples. in-hospital mortality, 7-day mortality, and 28-day mortality were 19.4%. overall case fatality ratio was 10.1% (11/109) in patients without underlying diseases (A) and 35.1% (27/77) with underlying diseases (B) a hemodialysis unit was found to have a MERS patient, and a total of 104 patients and 18 HCWs were exposed to MERS-CoV. the hemodialysis unit could continue to operate while the exposed patients were isolated in the unit. environmental contamination MERS-CoV could survive for longer than 48 hours at 20\u00b0C. of the 186 cases, 23% were infected by undocumented contact between cases. a minimum room ventilation rate of six air changes per hour should be implemented to minimize recirculation of pathogen-bearing droplets. a case of a 39-year-old female nurse who was infected with MERS-CoV during a cardiopulmonary resuscitation lasting 1 hour. 591 asymptomatic HCWs, three (0.5%) asymptomatic HCWs (two nurses and one physician) were found to be MERS-CoV (+) but they did not transmit the virus to others. the potential for transmission from asymptomatic rRT-PCR positive individuals is still unknown. a hemodialysis unit was found to have a MERS patient. a total of 104 patients and 18 HCWs were exposed to MERS-CoV. the outbreak was driven by the superspreaders who visited multiple healthcare facilities. serological surveillance conducted after the MERS outbreak showed 0.3% (2/737) of them were MERS-CoV IgG positive by an indirect immunofluorescent assay. none of the 285 HCWs were positive for MERS-CoV immunoglobulin G, although 38.2% (109/285) of the HCWs reported experiencing MERS-like symptoms while caring for the MERS patients. the government requested the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases to participate in the control of the outbreak. the 2015 Korea outbreak was the largest outside of the Middle East. the outbreak unveiled the weak points of infrastructure in our medical system. early detection and isolation is of critical impor- tance. 8.5 billion US dollars MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus."}
