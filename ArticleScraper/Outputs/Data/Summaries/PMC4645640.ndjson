{"summary": "hepatitis C virus transmission dynamics could increase effectiveness of public health control initiatives. a small number of districts were found to be central to HCV transmission and likely driving the spread of the virus. the spliced BamHI A rightward transcripts (BARTs) induce consistent transcriptional changes in cells. 50% of genes that were decreased more than 2-fold during latent EBV infection also were decreased by BART expression alone. marandu et al. tested this hypothesis by challenging old mice carrying latent mouse CMV, herpes simplex virus 1 or murine gammaherpesvirus 68 with several emerging viruses. Mortality and weight loss upon challenge were similar in latently infected mice and in controls."}
