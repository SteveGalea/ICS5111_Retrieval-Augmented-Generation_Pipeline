{"summary": "a promising strategy is to develop new drugs targeting the parasites\u2019 cysteine proteases that are crucial for their growth, differentiation and pathogenicity. the coronavirus main protease (Mpro), the papain-like protease (SARS-CoV PLpro) are also considered to be major targets for new antiviral drugs against SARS and other coronavirus infections. the isolation of new tetromycin derivatives with unprecedented inhibitory activities against several clinically important cysteine proteases is reported. the choice to use cysteine proteases as target enzyme is based on the tetronic acid moiety which is part of all the isolated metabolites. z 911.4232 [M + Na]+ matching a molecular formula of C50H64O14 which was isomeric with tetromycin C1 [13] and tetromycin 4 with m/z 897.4066 [M + Na]+ corresponding to a molecular formula of C49H62O14 which was isomeric with tetromycin C1 [13] and tetromycin 4 with m/z 897.4066 [M + 5.5 CH2 2.32 m 40.4 CH2 2.23 m 40.6 CH2 2.38 m 10 132.1 C 131.1 C 131.1 C 131.6 C 131.4 C 10\u2032 22.0 CH3 1.31 s 21.8 CH3 1.33 s 22.9 CH3 1.31 s 21.7 CH3 1.35 s 11 123.2 CH 6.17 s 123.1 CH 6.08 s 122.9 CH 6.11 s 122.8 CH 6.15 s 12 46.4 C 46.2 C 42.0 C 19.2 CH3 1.69 s 19.2 CH3 1.69 s 19.2 CH3 1.69 s 22 39.59 CH2 2.29 m 39.9 CH2 2.20 m 34.1 CH2 2.32 m 39.7 CH2 2.26 m 1.94 m 1.97 m 1.19 m 1.95 m 23 84.4 CH 3.33 dt (10.4, 4.8) 85.0 CH 3.36 dt (10.2, 4.8) 84.56 CH 3.41 dd (9.8, 2.7) 31 75.8 CH 3.33 m 67.6 CH 4.03 m 67.3 CH 4.17 m 67.2 CH 4.18 m 31\u2032 23.7 CH3 1.32 d (7.21) 18.4 CH3 1.24 d (6.2) 18.3 CH3 1.25 d (6.2) 32 170.6 C 164.8 C 171.1 C 171.1 C 171.1 C 33 113.1 C 108.0 C 106.2 C 34 139.1 C 144.0 C 144.5 the 13C NMR indicated the presence of a two-times hydroxy/alkoxy-substituted aromatic moiety made of carbons C33\u201338. the corresponding signals in the 1H NMR spectra showed only two aromatic protons (H35; H37) in meta-position to each other of the aromatic ring.

HSQC spectra showed two diastereotopic protons H22 ( 2.26, 1.95) attached to C22 ( 39.7) no double bond could be located in the second six-membered ring of the decalin system. tetromycin 3 exhibiting a molecular ion in the positive ESIMS spectrum was found to be a completely new derivative. tetromycins 1, 2 and 4, methyl group protons H20\u2032 of 3 correlated with C20, C21, and also with C27 ( 103.1), which reinforces the proposition of assigning 120.3 to C21 instead of to C20. the second six-membered ring only features saturated carbon atoms. none of the named correlations to a methyl group could be found. the loss of the methyl group at C12 was in accordance with the observed lower molecular mass, also indicating a formal loss of a CH2-fragment. tetromycins 1\u20134 and tetromycin B (5) (IC50, M) were subjected to protease inhibition assays with mammalian proteases cathepsin B and L. all compounds were inactive or only weakly active (10% inhibition at 100). in cases of time-dependent inhibition the pseudo-first order rate constants of inhibition kobs were fitted against the inhibitor concentrations to obtain Ki, ki, and finally k2nd values. the following inhibition constants were obtained: ki = 2.1 M; ki = 0.042 min1; k2nd = 38,100 M1 min1. dependent inhibition could either be due to an irreversible inhibition mechanism resulting from covalent reaction of the reactive moiety of the inhibitors, the tetronic acid containing an,-unsaturated lactone ring. the reasons for the differences between cathepsin-L like proteases are not yet clear and will require more detailed studies. k2nd (M1 min1) CB Ki (M) SARS-CoV-PLpro Ki (M) 3 2.1 0.90; 36,600 1590 1.65 0.25; 617 9 15.0 1.95; 14,977 2005 0.57 0.04 n.d. tetromycin 2 was observed to have a molecular ion in the positive ESIMS spectrum at m/z 911.4232 [M + Na]+ corresponding to a molecular formula of C50H64O14 which was isomeric with tetromycin C1 [13] and tetromycin 4 with m/z 897.4066 [M + Na]+ matching a molecular formula of C49H62O14 which was isomeric with d (9.2) 131.1 CH 5.14 d (7.1) 8 32.9 CH2 2.27 m 34.1 CH2 2.27 m 33.8 CH2 2.27 m 9 36.3 CH2 2.27 m 35.5 CH2 2.32 m 40.4 CH2 2.23 m 40.6 CH2 2.38 m 10 132.1 C 131.1 C 131.1 C 131.6 C 131.4 C 10\u2032 22.0 CH3 1.31 s 21.8 CH3 1.33 s 22.9 CH3 1.31 124.8 CH 4.90 s 125.6 CH 4.93 s 141.5 C 125.8 CH 4.92 s 20\u2032 14.3 CH3 1.48 s 21 140.9 C 140.2 C 120.3 CH 4.95 d (2.3) 140.4 C 21\u2032 19.2 CH3 1.69 s 18.9 CH3 1.69 s 22 39.59 CH2 2.29 m 39.9 CH2 2.20 m 34.1 CH2 2.32 m 39.7 CH2 2.26 m 1.94 the IR spectra of tetromycins 1\u20134 showed the expected absorption bands for hydroxy groups (3200 cm1), acid functions (2800 cm1), conjugated carbonyl groups (1640 cm1), C\u2013C-double. carbon-proton connectivities were unambiguously assigned by HSQC experiments. the 13C NMR indicated the presence of a two-times hydroxy/alkoxy-substituted aromatic moiety made of carbons C33\u201338. the signals in the 1H NMR spectra showed only two aromatic protons (H35; H37) in meta-position to each other of the aromatic ring. HMBC and ROESY data established the connectivity of the pyran group to the decalin ring system consisting of C4, C5, C19\u2013C26 via the acetal in para-position to the ester/amide junction. the main differences between tetromycins 1, 2, and 4 and their previously isolated congeners covered in a patent lie in the presence of a double bond between C20 and C21. HMBC correlation of the vinylic proton H20 (4.92) with C24 ( 46.5) no double bond could be located in the second six-membered ring of the decalin system, specifically not between C25 and C26 as featured in the previously described compounds. data of tetromycin 3 revealed two diastereotopic protons H22 ( 1.93, 2.32) located at C22 ( 34.1). HMBC correlation of C23 with H22 (1.93) again accounted for the single bond between C23 and C22. in this compound C23 also shows strong HMBC correlation to vinylic proton H21 ( 4.95), suggesting close proximity to the carbon at 120.3 (C21) which is a CH-unit according to DEPT data. HMBC correlation of C12\u2032 with H13 and H16 and those of H12\u2032 with C13, C14, C17, C11, and C12. none of the named correlations to a methyl group could be found. the compounds also showed cytotoxic activities with IC50 100 M against the kidney cell line and macrophages. the compounds also showed antiparasitic and cytotoxic activities of tetromycins 1\u20134 and tetromycin B (5). inhibition of cathepsin B and the coronaviral papain-like protease was not. all compounds were inactive or only weakly active (10% inhibition at 100 M) against the SARS-CoV Mpro. time-dependent inhibition was found only with cathepsin-L like enzymes, not with cathepsin B or the coronaviral protease PLpro. this observed time-dependent inhibition could either be due to an irreversible inhibition mechanism. the reasons for the differences are not yet clear. tetromycins 3\u20134 and tetromycin B (5) were acquired in spectroscopy grade MeOH using a 3 mm Nalorac MDBG probe and a 5 mm cold probe.
