{"summary": "severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTS) was identified as a novel tick-borne Bunynavirus in genus Phlebovirus. it is also known as Huaiyangshan virus, since the original cases were identified in the Huaiyangshan Mountains in 2009 [1], [6], [7]. data collected at one or two time points of the disease process. changes in SFTSV viral load, platelets and white blood cell counts, levels of key serum enzymes, cytokine profile and changes in two important T subset populations were measured every other day during the first 10\u201315 days of hospitalization for four deceased patients. sample collection and processing All SFTSV-infected patients received standard antiviral and standard support treatments after admission to the hospital based on SFTS treatment guidelines from the Chinese Ministry of Health. samples were collected during hospitalization at Days 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 after onset of fever. blood samples from healthy donors were collected at a single time point at the time of enrollment. florescent-conjugated mouse anti-human CD3-PerCP Cy5.5, CTLA-4-PE, CD4-FITC, CD28-PE, CD8-PE, CD69-FITC, CD25-PE, CD56-PE, HLA-DR-FITC. cytokines were detected using human Th1/Th2/Th17 Cytometric Bead Array (BD BioScience), according to manufacturer's instructions. study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. thirty-two healthy volunteers (21 males and 11 females) were also enrolled in the study. the virus RNA was extracted from the plasma samples using a RNA extraction kit. RT-PCR amplification was conducted immediately on the fluorescent quantitative PCR detector (ABI StepOne Plus) 33 patients with laboratory-confirmed SFTSV infection were admitted to the Jiangsu People's Hospital, Nanjing, china. at admission, all patients had confirmed positive SFTSV in blood samples determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with designated primers for SFTSV L, M, S genes. three out of four deceased patients who were admitted on day 7 of disease onset died within three days of admission with much higher levels of viral load. one of the deceased patients had similar levels of viral load to those who survived. s of platelet (PLT) (A) and white blood cell (WBC) (B) counts, serum alanine transaminase (ALT) (C), aspartate transaminase (AST) (D), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (E) and creatine kinase (CK) (F) were all highly elevated in both deceased patients and survivors. all four patients died before Day 9 from symptom onset. all these biomarkers were highly elevated. Table 2: Critical parameters associated the severity of SFTS. cells gradually returned to normal levels in survivors around 2 weeks after disease onset. red and black curves represent the deceased patient group and the survivors. values are presented as mean percentages with standard error of each T cell subset at each time point during hospitalization from Day 5 to Day15 days from onset of fever. specific cytokines were measured further to identify those that may be involved in the pathogenesis of SFTS. there were no significant differences for IL-2, IL-4, TNF-, or IL-17A in serum samples between SFTSV-infected patients and the normal control group. however, significant elevations of serum IL-6, IL-10, and IFN- were discovered in deceased patients. the red and black curves represent the deceased patient group and the survivors. the values were presented as mean cytokine concentrations with standard errors at each time point. the green dashed line in each graph indicates mean cytokine concentrations in the normal control group. total CD3+ T cells and total CD4+ T cells were decreased in SFTSV-infected patients, more so during acute phase infection, in severe cases, and in those who eventually die from the disease [11]. at same time, there is no significant change in CD8+ T cells [11], [14]. an increase in HLA-DR+/CD8+ T cells is often in response to antigen binding and signaling. CTLA4 is a T-cell co-stimulatory molecule on antigen-presenting cells. a late increase in HLA-DR+ and CTLA4+ T cells may indicate protective immune responses. study identified concurrent patterns of dynamic changes for viral load, PLT, key serum enzymes, major T cell subsets and unique cytokines in SFTS patients. findings on the involvement of CD69+ as well as HLA-DR+ and CTLA4+ T cells in SFTSV infection will lead more targeted research on the mechanism of pathogenesis in the coming future."}
