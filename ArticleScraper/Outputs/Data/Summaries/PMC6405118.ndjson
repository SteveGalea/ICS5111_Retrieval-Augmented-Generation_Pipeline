{"summary": "human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the predominant etiological agent. infections by other respiratory viruses, such as human rhinovirus (HRV), metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus, and coronavirus, also occur. etiological diagnosis can be carried out in clinical practice only by virus identification. the use of corticosteroids during the acute phase of infection with high levels of HRV may reduce the risk of wheezing in the subsequent year [10, 11]. PBMC transcriptome profiles can be used to assess disease severity in infants with HRSV [7] and to predict individualized responses to HRV [14]. a total of 12 out of 124 infants under 6 months of age were selected from a prospective cohort study on the etiology of acute viral bronchiolitis. the median age of the infants of the HRSV group and the HRV group was similar (41.5 days and 64 days, respectively; p = 0.8). sample collection and total RNA extraction Whole blood was collected in an EDTA-containing tube within 24 hours after hospital admission. the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were immediately separated by gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Heathcare, cat. no. 17144002) the total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 76106) the microarray images were captured by the reader Agilent Bundle. Spots with two or more flags (low intensity, saturation, controls, etc.) were considered as NA. module eigengene (ME) is defined as the first principal component of a given module. module membership (MM) is defined as the correlation of each gene expression profile with the module eigengene of a given module. all infants were submitted to molecular analysis of nasopharyngeal secretion. patients\u2019 peripheral blood samples were collected for genomic analysis. a total of 12 out of 124 infants under 6 months of age were selected from a prospective cohort study on the etiology of acute viral bronchiolitis. sample collection and total RNA extraction Whole blood was collected in an EDTA-containing tube within a maximum of 24 hours after hospital admission. the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were immediately separated by gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Heathcare, cat. no. 17144002) and stored at -20\u00b0C until RNA extraction. the microarray images were captured by the reader Agilent Bundle. Spots with two or more flags (low intensity, saturation, controls, etc.) were considered as NA. module membership (MM) is defined as the correlation of each gene expression profile with the module eigengene of a given module [17]. module-HRSV or HRV association Firstly, we obtained the gene significance (GS), which is a value of the correlation between the trait (here is represented by HRSV or HRV groups) and the gene expression values. genes presenting high GS and MM were considered as hubs in the module. functional enrichment analysis KEGG pathway enrichment was performed using the Gene Ontology database. 3.3 999.9 6.8 0.00 protein binding TTC28 2678.2 401.9 6.7 0.00 cell division ZNF2a 6052.0 910.6 6.6 0.00 regulation of transcription, DNA-templated ZSCAN2 3203.1 482.2 6.6 0.00 regulation of transcription, DNA-templated POLR2J2 3675.9 587.7 6.3 0.00 transcription, DNA-templated TBXA2R 4479.4 587.7 6.3 0.00 transcription, the comparison was done using t-test with adjusted Bonferroni correction. 99 DE genes (60 hyper-expressed and 39 hypo-expressed genes in the HRSV group in comparison with the HRV group) are significantly over-represented in BP terms. a total of five modules were significantly (p0.05) associated with HRSV. three of those five modules were positively associated with HRSV group. none module was associated with gender.

PBMC transcriptomic analysis revealed different expression profiles between HRSV and HRV infection. five hypo-expressed genes in HRSV group are involved in neutrophil activation processes. three genes expressing neutrophil chemoattractants were hyper-expressed in HRSV infection. the gene coexpression network analysis revealed distinct modules (tan, midnight-blue, turquoise, purple and brown) containing genes involved in immune response, activation of interferon pathway and apoptosis. modules are important to maintain the structure of the network or modules [29\u201331] APOL1 codifies for an apolipoprotein 1, which is a mediator protein acting on IFN-activated genes [34, 35] and the proteins of the apolipoprotein family, such as APOL6, has an HRSV antiviral activity related to apoptosis [36] iv) IDO1 encoded protein was described to control viral infection by modulating specific metabolic events [37]. PBMC transcriptional profiles of hospitalized infants with HRSV or HRV bronchiolitis are different and probably correlated with distinctive etiopathogenic mechanisms. a better understanding of PBMC specific host responses to HRSV or HRV may serve to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms triggered by different viral agents. the red or blue dot lines indicate the cut off of GS or MM values significantly for HRSV or HRV groups. the red or blue dot lines indicate, respectively, the cut off of GS or MM values significantly for HRSV or HRV groups (p 0.01)."}
