{"summary": "type I and III IFNs are well known for their induction and potent antiviral activity directly in response to viral infection. a family of IFNs named type III IFNs were discovered in the human genome based on their similarity to type I IFN and IL-10 family members. the IL10R2 chain plays little role in ligand specificity but participates in the signalling cascade leading to the induction of ISGs. the type III IFNR complex is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and cells. this expression pattern may reflect a role for type III IFNs in antiviral activity at the major portals of viral entry. pteropid bats have two transcribed IFN- genes that are differentially induced relative to each other and to type I IFNs. pteropid bats have two transcribed IFN- genes that are differentially induced relative to each other. mononuclear splenocytes were isolated by density centrifugation over lymphoprep (Axis-Shield) culture media for mononuclear splenocytes consisted of DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 15 mM Hepes, 15 mM L-glutamine, 100 mg/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. PCR was performed on genomic DNA extracted from P. alecto liver using primers IFN-R1-2F/6R listed in Table S1. resultsant RACE and PCR products were cloned and sequenced using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) and BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v3.1 respectively. qRT-PCR primers for IFNR1 and IL10R2 were designed using Primer Express 3.0. qRT-PCR primers for ISG56, RIG-I and 18s rRNA have been described previously. all data were normalised relative to the housekeeping gene 18s rRNA. treatment of the bat cells with recombinant IFN-2 containing supernatant was used as mock control. bat cloned kidney cells, PaKiT01 and primary bat cell lines were treated with 12 diluted IFN-2 containing supernatant. six bat cell lines were used, including one cloned and immortalised kidney cell line (PaKiT01) and five primary cell lines originating from kidney, small intestine, brain, liver and lung. all cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37\u00b0C. isolation of fresh splenocytes from P. alecto bats has been described previously. PCR was performed on RNA extracted from polyI:C stimulated PaLuT02 cells using the GeneRacer Kit (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with Long-amp DNA polymerase (New England Biosystems) Primers were designed based on P. vampyrus genome sequence information deposited in the Ensembl Genome Browser (assembly pteVam1, 2.633 coverage, July 2008) sequences for IFNR1 and IL10R2 were compared with sequences in the GenBank database. sequence alignments were performed using the Clustal X program [23] and visualized using GeneDoc. transmembrane regions and Signal peptides were identified by TMHMM 2.0 and SignalP version 3.0 respectively. 2 l of 15 diluted cDNA were used for each reaction from cDNA. in a reaction from RNA, 2 l RNA per well were used. a final concentration of 200nmol each primer was used in these reactions. pCAGGS transient expression vector was cloned into the pCAGGS transient expression vector with an in-frame C-terminal 6His tag. the plasmid was prepared using PureYield kit (Promega) before transfection. soluble variants of IFNR1 and IL10R2 have been identified in other species. RT-PCR was performed on P. alecto spleen and thymus RNA. a single form of IFNR1 and IL10R2 has been deposited into the genebank database. intron-exon structures predicted by nucleotide alignment of IFNR1 or IL10R1 mRNA with the corresponding sequences in either the P. vampyrus or human genome sequences. deduced proteins encoded by IFNR1 and IL10R2 contained many of the conserved features present in human genes. two of the conserved cysteine and tyrosine residues in IFNR1 are conserved in bat IFN-R1 and are further boxed. dashes indicated similarity and dots indicate gaps. IFNR1 and IL10R2 are transcribed in a range of organs in P. alecto. the three immune related cells and organs, PBMC, spleen and lymph nodes had the highest expression of IL10R2. the IFNR1 chain is unique to the IFNR complex and has substantially higher ligand affinity than the IL10R2 chain [3], [6], [7], [14]. in humans, the IFNR1 chain is unique to the IFNR complex and has substantially higher ligand affinity than the IL10R2 chain. Western blotting shows proportion of epithelial cells in each cell line population. if a similar pattern exists in humans, we used a cross-specific epithelial cell marker (anti-cytokeratin) to determine whether a similar pattern exists in bats. the right axis shows the relative expression level of IFNR1 (mean of three experiments) the expression level was normalized to the housekeeping gene 18s rRNA. the error bars represent standard errors. IFNR1 expression plasmid or empty vector was transfected for 24 hours. total RNA was extracted for qRT-PCR analysis. the error bars represent standard errors. cDNA sequences of IFNR1 and IL10R2 have been deposited into the GenBank database. a single form of IFNR1 and IL10R2 is found in the bat IFNR1 locus. the locus contains seven exons and six introns in the 3\u2032-UTR region. deduced proteins encoded by IFNR1 and IL10R2 contained many of the conserved features present in human genes. a 23 aa transmembrane region encoded by exon six separates the protein into a 203 aa extracellular domain. tyrosine residues in IFNR1 are conserved in bat IFN-R1 and are further boxed. tyrosine residues in IFNR1 are involved in meditation of STAT2 phosphorylation. IFNR1 and IL10R2 are transcribed in a range of organs in P. alecto primary organs. a higher level of variation between organs was detected in the expression of IL10R2 compared with IFNR1. bat primary cells, including five non-hematopoietic cell lines, were examined for their response to recombinant bat IFN-2 [21] there is a correlation between the expression of IFNR1 (Fig. 4A) and the induction of the two ISGs tested. kidney, lung and small intestine which have relatively high IFNR1 expression show correspondingly high ISGs induction. in humans, the IFNR1 expression among non-hematopoietic cells is restricted to epithelial cells [5]. a cross-specific epithelial cell marker (anti-cytokeratin) is used to determine the proportion of epithelial cells in each cell line population. the western blot shows a correlation between the proportion of epithelial cells within the cell lines, their IFNR1 expression and ISGs production. the expression level was normalized to the housekeeping gene 18s rRNA. the error bars represent standard errors. IFNR1 is a functional receptor of IFN-. IFNR1, ISG56 and RIG-I mRNA expression were tested and indicated by relative expression. the error bars represent standard errors. truncated IFNR1 acting as a dominant negative receptor chain. in humans and Xenopus, the IFNR1 chain is expressed by a range of tissues with a high level of variation. in mice, IFNR1 is expressed predominantly in stomach, small intestine and skin. the restricted expression pattern of IFNR1 in non-haematopoietic cells is similar to other species and is consistent with a role for IFN- in contributing to the elimination of viruses at the major portals of entry into the body. the absence of specific cell markers to characterize bat immune cells will provide further insights into the role of IFN- in antiviral immunity in bats. to our knowledge, our results provide the first molecular characterization of the IFNR system in any species of bat."}
