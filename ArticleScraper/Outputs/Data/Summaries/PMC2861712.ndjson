{"summary": "the two genera in the family Filoviridae cause fulminant hemorrhagic disease in humans and nonhuman primates. the virus is classified as a highest-priority bioterrorism agent by the centre for disease control. it is unclear how NCs are transported from viral inclusions to the PM. spherical enveloped viruses are produced by budding away from the cytoplasm in a process that is topologically equivalent to the formation of small vesicles in multivesicular bodies. the basic steps of assembly and release for large, filamentous, enveloped particles such as the filoviruses are poorly understood. EM of ultrathin sections allows complete MARV virions and budding structures to be studied in 3D. this permits unambiguous determination of virus morphology, dimensions, stage of budding and position relative to the infected cell. the samples are prepared by high-pressure freezing followed by embedding in resin and staining with heavy metals. 80% of the virus particles displayed the characteristic filamentous morphology of the filoviruses. later in infection, the specific infectivity was lower and correlated with fewer filamentous particles and more round or bent particles. there was also an increase in the release of cellular vesicular material over time. 6 nm digital slice of a tomogram showing the periphery of an intact cell and the filamentous morphology of the viruses associated with the cell profile. quantification was done as in C. (G) Vesiculated morphology of an infected cell at day 4 p.i.. cell morphology and morphology of cell-associated virus was assessed by examination of plastic-embedded thin sections of MARV-infected cells embedded in their in situ orientation. the decrease in amount of filamentous virus and of intact cell profiles from day one to day four p.i. and the increasing amount of spherical virus and vesiculated cell profiles. infected cell monolayers were fixed at 1 day p.i., removed from the BSL-4 facility, processed for EM and cut into 300 nm thick sections in their in situ orientation. 3D reconstructions were computationally generated, using the NC itself as a convenient marker for identifying virus assembly intermediates. coloured overlay is the surface representation of viral NC (blue) and 3D surface rendering of surrounding membrane and cytoplasm (yellow) it shows a filamentous budding structure with the viral NC fully inserted into the budding site. 3D surface representation is shifted relative to the tomogram slice for improved visualisation. the majority (87%) of budding structures had the NC completely inserted into the finger-like membrane extension (Figure 2D, E) the majority (87%) of budding structures had the NC completely inserted into the finger-like membrane extension (Figure 2D, E) most released viruses appeared as straight filaments in 3D reconstructions. filamentous viruses were on average 789 nm long and had a diameter of 88 nm. some filamentous viruses displayed one bent or buckled end giving rise to hooked or six-shaped particles. membrane formed a round, intact hemisphere at the opposite tip. only 2 out of 21 filamentous viruses had two round, intact tips. membrane distortions at both ends were never observed. 3D analysis revealed that most viruses were roughly spherical in shape. they were generally found in close proximity to convoluted, vesiculating areas of the PM and often surrounded by large numbers of cell-derived vesicles. this suggests that release of spherical viruses occurs simultaneously with the shedding of other cell-derived vesicles. right panel is a digital slice of a tomogram taken from a MARV-infected cell at 4 days p.i. showing the round shape of a virus and three cross sections of the viral NC. the 3D reconstruction reveals that the viral NC is kinked but continuous. infectivity in each supernatant was determined in a TCID50 assay. infectivity in each supernatant was normalized for NP amounts in each supernatant to determine the specific infectivity. morphology of infected cells and cell-associated virus was assessed by thawed cryosections of pelleted virus in a systematic random sampling manner. cell morphology and morphology of cell-associated virus was assessed by examination of thawed cryosections of pelleted virus in a systematic random sampling manner. over 90% of all observed virions around the cells were filamentous or hooked. only 17% of the cell profiles were intact and 83% appeared vesiculated. production of fully infectious, filamentous virus is highest at 1\u20132 days p.i. panels show digital slices of tomograms of MARV-infected cells at 1 day p.i.. the different steps of MARV budding and release are (A) Intracellular NC in the cytoplasm. the length of PM-associated NCs was 707 nm (Figure 2B, Table 2). striated structures were more densely stained than the cytoplasm. the majority (87%) of budding structures had the NC completely extruded. isphere 2/21 viruses have two hemispheres nucleocapsid length intracellular 711.1 nm 68.3 nm (n = 7) plasma membrane associated 707.7 nm 126.8 nm (n = 17) in partially extruded buds 728.5 nm 45.7 nm (n = 3) in fully extruded buds 736.5 nm 52.7 nm (n = 20) in released filamentous virus 3D analysis revealed that NCs in all released virions had the same length, on average 735 nm, and appeared bent or kinked when particles were hooked or six-shaped. the presence of NCs of the same length in the cytoplasm suggests that the NC assembles into a helix of a defined and final length before being transported to the PM. membrane distortions are found at the rear end of filamentous MARV particles. MARV infected cells were embedded and sectioned in their in situ orientation. morphology of filamentous viruses was examined in electron tomograms of 300 nm thick sections. kinked NCs in spherical viruses had a total length of 734 nm. the same length as NCs in filamentous virions. the findings demonstrate that preassembled full-length NCs are packaged into each virion, irrespective of virus shape. the length of the viral genome and number of nucleoproteins required to encapsidate the genome dictate the length of the intracellular NC prior to its transport to the PM. in the \u201crocket-like\u201d model, the NC is extruded vertically from the PM. a fast process along the length of the NC until the nascent virion protrudes from the membrane, remaining attached at only one end. the model is based on 3D tomographic reconstructions of MARV-infected cell sections. single and triple arrows depict slow and fast processes. if the rate of scission was significantly increased, then large numbers of protruding buds would accumulate, giving the appearance of a predominant \u201crocket-like\u201d mode of budding. we suggest the contrasting appearance of Ebola virus and MARV infected cells in EM does not reflect different budding mechanisms. budding VSV, a rhabdovirus, can be found protruding perpendicular to cell membranes in infected cells. the rounded end of the virus seems to associate more tightly with the membrane. after budding, the rear of the virus is seen to show small membrane blebs or instabilities similar to those described here for MARV. the model for filamentous virus budding presented here raises a number of new questions. do elements of the cytoskeleton or other cellular components play a specific role in mediating envelopment or budding of filamentous viruses. HUH-7 cells were infected with MARV with a multiplicity of infection of approximately 1 plaque-forming unit per cell for one to four days. cell culture supernatants were collected and used for viral infectivity assays, or viruses in the supernatants were purified by centrifugation. TCID50 values were normalized to NP levels detected in each supernatant. the TCID50 value in the supernatant collected at day 2 p.i. was set to 100%. samples were frozen with a balTec HPM-010. samples were washed three times with glass distilled acetone in a temperature-controlling device (Leica EM AFS I) cells were kept for 40 h at 90\u00b0C and warmed up to 0\u00b0C (slope 5\u00b0C/h) samples were infiltrated at room temperature with increasing concentrations of epoxy resin. 3D measurements of virus end distance, analysis of virus end morphology and 3D surface renderings were carried out using the AMIRA Visualisation Package. in total, 68 3D reconstructions from three independent infection experiments were analysed, of which 48 of high image quality were used for detailed analysis and measurements. HUH-7 cells were grown on carbon-coated sapphire disks. fixed cells were removed from the BSL-4 lab after 48 h of inactivation. TCID50 values were calculated using the Spearman-Karber method. cell culture supernatants were purified by centrifugation over a sucrose cushion, pelleted for 30 min at 40,000 g, 4\u00b0C in a Beckman ultracentrifuge using a TLA-55 rotor. 70 nm cryosections were obtained with a leica EM UC6 microtome, FC6 cryochamber and a diamond knife. 150 nm and 300 nm sections were examined on a FEI Morgagni 268 TEM. 68 3D reconstructions from three independent infection experiments were analysed. NC representations in Figures 2 and 4 and Video S1 and Video S2 were generated and displayed using the AMIRA EM package [55] and MatLab (version 7.4.287). supporting information Video S1 Release of filamentous Marburg virus particles at one day post infection."}
