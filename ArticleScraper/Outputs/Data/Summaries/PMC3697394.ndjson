{"summary": "HRV is a positive-stranded RNA virus that is a member of the Picornaviridae family. it is known as the cause of the common cold, but it has been increasingly associated with worsening of symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. 80 to 85% of asthma exacerbations in children (2, 3) and 75% in adults (4) have been associated with viral upper respiratory tract infections. enviroxime is an enteroviral inhibitor that acts at the level of RNA replication. it failed due to poor exposure and lack of efficacy when administered intranasally. the lack of efficacy of enviroxime when administered intranasally could be due to poor solubility. the only HRV inhibitor in clinical development is vapendavir (BTA798), which is an analog of pirodavir. a phase II trial showed that oral vapendavir reduced asthma symptoms. however, it has been reported that vapendavir is not effective against all HRV genotypes (20) cytopathic effect (CPE)-based cell protection assays for HRV-B14 and HRV-A16 were established in 384-well format. other genotypes of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were used for profiling in same assay format. MRC-5 cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1958) and maintained in a complete medium, minimum essential medium (MEM) (catalog no. 11095; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) the titers of the virus were determined by infecting H1-HeLa cells seeded the day before at 25,000 cells/well with serial dilutions of virus in a 96-well plate. the plates were incubated for 3 days at 34\u00b0C (or 37\u00b0C for CVA21) with 5% CO2 until a complete cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed, typically after 4 days. 18,750 H1-HeLa or MRC-5 cells were seeded in clear 384-well plates. inhibitors were serially diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted further with medium. 10 l was added to each well in order to achieve desired multiplicity of infection. qRT-PCR was performed in 96-well plates using 5 l of extracted RNA. cytotoxicity of each compound was assessed in parallel using same assay without the addition of virus. serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed HRV-B14 RNA were used to generate a standard curve. HRV replication was expressed as the number of copies per microgram of total RNA by correcting for the total amount of RNA present in each well. undifferentiated HBECs were seeded on the apical side of a 12-well Transwell plate. the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and the medium was changed every 2 days. after 7 days in culture, the medium was removed from the apical side. cells were washed 5 times with 200 l of HRV assay medium. -B14 infectious cDNA pWR3.26 (VRMC-7) and HRV-A1 infectious cDNA pR16.11 (VRMC-8) were obtained from ATCC. full-length HRV-C15 W10 LUC (LUC stands for luciferase) was synthesized at DNA 2.0. the percent inhibition was calculated for each inhibitor concentration. subgenomic replicons of HRV-B14 and HRV-A16 were constructed based on the literature. a 3CD cleavage site was introduced between the reporter gene and the remainder of VP3. the assay was terminated 48 h postinfection by the addition of 20 l of MTS-PMS (1/20), the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 3.5 h, and the absorbance at 492 nm was read on an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer) the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 3.5 h. supernatants were collected when the CPE reached at least 50%. the supernatant (0.2 to 0.5 ml) was used to reinfect fresh H1-HeLa cells. a resistance study was performed over 30 days, reaching a concentration of 20 EC50. the TaqMan EZ RT-PCR kit (ABI) was used to perform qRT-PCRs on an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system. serial dilutions of untreated cellular RNA from all the cell lines were used to generate a standard curve for each gene-specific expression analysis to determine relative changes in transcript levels. small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were obtained from Dharmacon/Thermo Scientific. the transfection agent was DharmaFECT 4 from Dharmacon/Thermo Scientific. Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) was used to dilute siRNA. dosing suspensions of T-00127-HEV-1 and compound 2 were prepared in 1% N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 0.3% Tween 80, and 0.5% methylcellulose in water. single doses of 5, 50, and 250 mg/kg of body weight were administered orally at a dosing volume of 10 ml/kg. plasma samples were transferred and frozen at 20\u00b0C pending analysis. the mixture was loaded onto Phenomenex Strata X-C cartridges previously conditioned with 1 ml of methanol followed by 1 ml of water\u20132% formic acid. the cartridges were washed with 1 ml of acetonitrile-water (1:9, vol/vol)\u20132% formic acid, and 500 l of methanol. the gradient was initially held for 0.1 min at 10% mobile phase B. followed by a 1.2-min linear ramp to 98% mobile phase B. the total LC run time was 3 min, including 0.7-min equilibration time between injections. normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) were obtained from Lonza (CC-2540) and propagated in BEBM (bronchial epithelial basal medium) for undifferentiated single-layer culture according to Lonza's cell culture specifications. when H1-HeLa cells were used to propagate virus, MEM was supplemented with 5% FBS (assay medium), and infected cells were incubated at 34\u00b0C with 5% CO enterovirus (EV) was amplified in MRC-5 cells in the presence of 5% FBS and 1 nonessential amino acids. infected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 until a complete CPE was observed. titers of the virus were determined on MRC-5 cells as described above for HRV. HRV-A16 is typically used at an MOI of 0.08. HRV-B14 is typically used at an MOI of 0.008. EV-infected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 72 h. HRV quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was performed based on literature (35) using the following probes and primers. total RNA was extracted from infected cells using Qiagen RNeasy 96 kit. undifferentiated HBECs were seeded in growth medium in a 96-well plate 1 day prior to infection. the medium was aspirated and replaced with an HRV-B14 viral suspension of 65 l in MEM with 5% FBS. the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cellular differentiation was monitored with an EVOM2 epithelial voltohmeter (World Precision Instrument) with an STX2 electrode in order to measure the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) after 13 days at the ALI, differentiated HBEC were infected. cells were washed 5 times with 200 l of HRV assay medium. a reporter-based replication assay with HRV-C15 W10 (GenBank accession no. GU219984.1), a T7 RNA promoter and a humanized firefly luciferase reporter gene and a 3CD cleavage site were introduced before the 5\u2032 end of VP4. a BstBI restriction site was added at the 3\u2032 end of the 3D polymerase after the 29-nucleotide poly(A) al amino acids from VP3 were kept, and a 3CD cleavage site was introduced between the reporter gene and the remainder of VP3. the subgenomic HRV-B14Luc and HRV-A16Luc DNA constructs were linearized with SacI and MluI restriction enzymes. RNA was transcribed using the T7 Ribomax RNA production system (Promega) and transfected by electroporation into H1-HeLa cells by the the virus was incubated with compounds at a concentration of 10 EC50 or 100 EC50 for 1 h at room temperature in a volume of 300 l. one hundred microliters was removed from each sample for unheated control. samples were quickly cooled by diluting 1/10 in room temperature MEM with 5% FBS. resistance study was performed over 30 days, reaching a concentration of 20 EC50. all supernatants were clarified by filtration (0.2 m) and were used immediately or stored at 80\u00b0C for subsequent rounds of infection, population sequence analysis, or antiviral susceptibility testing. cells were lysed in K buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktail. equal amounts of protein (30 g) were resolved by electrophoresis using a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS\u20130.1% Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) was used to dilute siRNA and transfection agent. siRNAs (10 nM) were transfected 24 h after seeding H1-HeLa cells at 10,000 cells/well in assay medium in 96-well plates. cells were then infected with HRV-B14 (MOI of 0.05 or 0.005) blood samples from groups of 4 animals were obtained via mandibular cheek puncture. the samples were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm and 4\u00b0C for 8 min. plasma samples were transferred and frozen at 20\u00b0C pending analysis. the residue was reconstituted in 100 to 150 l of acetonitrile-water (1:3, vol/vol) and 2 l was injected for liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) both drugs were analyzed using LC-MS/MS in positive ionization mode. 98,097 compounds were evaluated for antiviral activity against HRV-B14 with an average plate Z\u2032 of 0.9 and average plate Z of 0.76. single-point confirmation of primary hits was done on 1,361 compounds against HRV-B14 and HRV-A16 and were noncytotoxic (less than 25% inhibition) twenty hits exhibited activity against an initial panel of six HRVs. this resulted in the removal of six hits. capsid-binding inhibitors were removed due to lack of activity against the initial panel of 6 HRVs. this aminothiazole series appeared to have a unique mechanism of action acting later in the HRV infectious cycle at 6 h postinfection. antiviral activity of compounds against HRV in H1-HeLa and nondifferentiated HBEC Antiviral potency and virus or cella Compound 1 T-00127-HEV1. 14Luc 240 40 120 30 NDb 600 400 HRV-A16Luc 130 10 40 20 ND 200 100 HRV-C15Luc ND 60 20 ND 200 100 Toxicity CC50 (nM) H1-HeLa >64,000 >66,000 23,000 >64,000 HBEC HRV-B14 EC50 (nM) the same mutation was reverse engineered into the full-length HRV-B14 replicon. no shift in antiviral potency was seen in the comparison of wild-type viruses to mutant viruses in the regular HRV-based assay. no correlation was seen with PI4KIII activity, and indeed the majority of compounds were not active. the compound identified in this study (T-00127-HEV) was synthesized and had comparable activity to compounds 1 and 2 of the aminothiazole series in all antiviral and kinase assays. b x/number of kinases tested indicates that compound showed activity greater than 50% against x kinases. PIK93 is a relatively nonspecific lipid kinase inhibitor that has been shown to inhibit enteroviral infection. lack of activity of other specific protein and lipid kinase inhibitors demonstrates the importance of specificity for PI4KIII for inhibiting HRV. the qRT-PCR results are averages of four samples with standard deviations. two passages of H1-HeLa cells were examined by Western blotting. compound 2 and T-00127-HEV1 were evaluated in a larger panel of CPE-based assays and were found active against each virus of the panel of enteroviruses. compound 2 and T-00127-HEV1 showed a maximum concentration of compound in serum (Cmax) of >10 M following a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg in CD-1 mice. 400 200 4,800 100 CC50 (nM) >66,000 >64,000 CVB3 (Vero) EC50 (nM) 280 4,900 CC50 (nM) >50,000 >50,000 >50,000 CVB4 (nM) 120 710 CC50 (nM) >50,000 >50,000 >50,000 Echovirus 11 (BGM) EC50 (nM) 23 860 CC50 (nM) >50,000 >50,000 EV71 (RD) EC50 (nM) repeated dosing in SJL mice suggests short-term inhibition of PI4KIII is deleterious. PK and tolerability were assessed over 7 days. effects were seen on survival with both compounds from different structural classes. al screen against HRV was completed with a 98,000-compound subset of the Boehringer Ingelheim compound collection that was cherry-picked from the full proprietary collection. 98,097 compounds were evaluated for antiviral activity against HRV-B14 with an average plate Z\u2032 of 0.9 and average plate Z of 0.76. the overall hit rate was 1.4% at greater than 20% inhibition. compounds 1 and 2 appear to have a unique mechanism of action acting later in the HRV infectious cycle. this aminothiazole series was optimized for activity against HRV and had no cytotoxicity as demonstrated by compound 1 with an antiviral potency ranging from 110 to 480 nM against 10 HRV genotypes. antiviral activity of compounds against HRV in H1-HeLa and nondifferentiated HBEC Antiviral potency and virus or cella Compound 1 T-00127-HEV1 against panel of HRV-A and HRV-B Parametera Compound 1 T-00127-HEV1 Antiviral potency and virus HRV species A EC50 (nM) undifferentiated 60 10 ND ND Differentiated 300 20 ND ND a The EC50 and CC50 data are averages of three to eight experiments ( standard deviations) except for PIK93, which was tested once in this assay format. HRV-B14 antiviral assays with a qRT-PCR readout were also developed in both undifferentiated and differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells. the mutant virus, as well as the wild-type HRV-B14 virus, was grown in the presence of compounds for 24 h at 10 EC50. the mutant virus grew to the same titer as the wild-type virus in the absence of compounds. however, the lack of a shift in antiviral potency suggested that the resistance level was low, pointing toward a cellular target. a study was published showing that the target of enviroxime-like compounds is PI4KIII (15) the compound identified in this study (T-00127-HEV) was synthesized and had comparable activity to compounds 1 and 2 of the aminothiazole series in all antiviral and kinase assays. the compound identified in this study (T-00127-HEV) was synthesized and had comparable activity to compounds 1 and 2 of the aminothiazole series in PIK93 is a relatively nonspecific lipid kinase inhibitor that has been shown to inhibit enteroviral infection. lack of activity of other specific protein and lipid kinase inhibitors demonstrates the importance of specificity for PI4KIII for inhibiting HRV. the positions of molecular weight in kDa are shown to the right of the Western blot. data are averages of four samples with standard deviations. the data are representative of three experiments. compound 2 and T-00127-HEV1 were evaluated in a larger panel of CPE-based assays. compound 2 and T-00127-HEV1 showed a maximum concentration of compound in serum (Cmax) of >10 M following a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg in CD-1 mice. >50,000 >50,000 >50,000 EV71 (RD) EC50 (nM) 170 4,400 CC50 (nM) >50,000 >50,000 >50,000 a The CVA21 EC50 and CC50 data are average of three experiments ( standard deviation) all other data are from one experiment. repeated dosing in SJL mice suggests short-term inhibition of PI4KIII is deleterious. PK and tolerability were assessed over 7 days. all animals dosed with 250 mg of compound 2 per kg were euthanized 4 h. groups published on the link between enteroviral replication and PI4KIII include the identification of nonspecific (e.g., PIK93) and specific PI4KIII inhibitors (e.g., T-00127-HEV1). PI4KIII or PI4KIII has been shown to be essential for the replication of other viruses such as hepatitis C virus, west Nile virus, and coronavirus (39, 48\u201353). we demonstrated that the reverse-engineered I42V HRV produced 1,000 times more virus than the wild-type virus in the presence of compound. another group recently demonstrated that similar mutations in the 3A gene of CVB3 enable these mutant viruses to replicate efficiently in cells depleted of PI4KIII. repeat daily oral dosing of compound 2 and T-00127-HEV1 was performed over 7 days. Mortality was seen in all dosing groups except vehicle controls. no deleterious effects were seen in prior single-dose pharmacokinetic experiment. selective PI4KIII inhibitors from Novartis prevented proliferation of bone marrow cells and lymphocytes in vitro (64) no observations were noted in rats dosed orally over 4 days. ill effects were seen with both structural classes when administered orally."}
