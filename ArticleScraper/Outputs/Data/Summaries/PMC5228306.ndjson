{"summary": "Candida pneumonia was first described by Nils Ros\u00e9n von Rosenstein in 1984 (6), and later reported by Castellani in 1927 (7). only a limited number of cases have since been reported in the English literature (8). Candida pneumonia is one of the most challenging of all Candida infections to diagnose. a 64-year-old male patient was admitted to a people's hospital in taizhou, china. the patient had complaints of cough and dyspnea that had persisted for 6 days. no expectoration, chest pain, hemoptysis or oliguresis were reported. the admitting diagnosis was severe pneumonia due to suspected MERS, respiratory and heart failure, acid base imbalance and electrolyte disturbances, diabetes, chronic kidney insufficiency and hypertension. troponin was assessed as weakly positive (normal negative) by a troponin analyzer. brain natriuretic peptide was detected 4,567 pg/ml. pleural effusion and multiple lymphadenectasis in retrocaval and para-aortic arch area were observed. antibodies to syphilis and HIV in the blood were found to be negative at day 2 after admission. antibodies to syphilis and HIV in the blood were found to be negative at day 2 after admission. pleural effusion multiple lymphadenectasis in retrocaval and para-aortic arch area. the patient was isolated and received 95\u201398% oxygen at atmospheric pressure at a rate of 6 l/min through a nasal catheter for 24 h. the patient was administered sulbactam sodium/cefoperazone sodium (1:1) by injection (3.0 g/time), which is the total dose used for injection. treatment was administered at a minipump maintenance dose of 4\u201320 ml/h. renal function of the patient was aggravated, with the appearance of oliguria and anuresis. the patient succumbed to the infection 2 days after admission. nucleic acid detection method is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of Candida pneumonia (21). Considering the difficulty in performing biopsy, repeat blood and sputum cultures are typically conducted (4). the patient and his family disallowed for invasive operation because of their belief. tumescent lymph nodes may be an important symptom of Candida pneumonia. treatment should be initiated immediately in order to improve tissue oxygenation, restore cardiovascular function and improve other organ functions."}
