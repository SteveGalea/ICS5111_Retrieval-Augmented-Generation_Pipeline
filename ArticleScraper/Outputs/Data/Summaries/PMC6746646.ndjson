{"summary": "nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that has become a new treatment option for malignant tumors. a number of adverse events (ir-AEs) have been reported with this drug. a 62-year-old man with an unresectable lung adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in august 2013. decreased FT3 and FT4 values and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone value were found. but there were no clinical symptoms, and we followed him without treatment. he developed back pain, chest discomfort, general fatigue, and dyspnea. he developed an irregular heartbeat without murmurs or rales. s DNA antibodies, anti-RNP antibodies, anti-SS-A/Ro, and anti-SS-B/La antibodies, were all negative. chest X-ray showed cardiac enlargement with right-sided pleural effusion (B) myocarditis with diffuse myocardial edema was diagnosed. day 11, T2w-STIR-BB (d) and EGE (e) images showed improvement of edematous findings. biopsy revealed fibrosis of the myocardial tissue, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and T cell-dominant lymphocyte infiltration. myocardial tissue fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and T cell-dominant lymphocyte infiltration were found. infiltration of B cells was minimal (c: immunohistochemical staining for CD20 cells) from hospital day 4 the internal corticosteroid dose (prednisolone) was reduced to 60 mg daily (1 mg/kg) nivolumab is a novel remedy for malignant tumors that promotes the attack of cancer cells by lymphocytes. treatment with nivolumab is known to cause several ir-AEs, including thyroid dysfunction, colitis, pneumonitis, and rarely, type 1 diabetes. the frequency of myocarditis is 0.06% (8), whereas the frequencies of myocarditis due to other ICIs, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab-induced myocarditis can develop even one year after its administration. clinicians should consider nivolumab as a cause of myocarditis even if one year has passed from its introduction. administration Methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/day) +plus IVIg (400 mg/kg/day) Alive 9 72/M Melanoma After the third administration Prednisolone (1,000 mg/day) Alive Effective 10 55/M Lung cancer 21 days after the second administration Unknown Died 11 69/F Lung cancer One week after the third administration Methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/day) antibodies administered against ICIs may increase autoantibody levels against target organs or stimulate new autoantibody formation. the further accumulation of CMR findings of nivolumab-induced myocarditis is needed in order to better determine the characteristic findings of such cases. a case of nivolumab-induced myocarditis successfully treated with steroid therapy. nivolumab-induced myocarditis is a life-threatening adverse event."}
