{"summary": "cells were kept in a humidified incubator containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. the cells were treated with different concentrations of neutrophil elastase and/or EGCG for 24 h. the cells were seeded on glass coverslips in an environment containing 5% CO2 in air at 37 \u00b0C and then incubated in 10 nM neutrophil elastase and 20 M EGCG for 24 h. the cells were then incubated in an anti-human zinc finger antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C. the cells were incubated in Hoechst 33342 (1 g/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at room temperature. the immunostained specimens were observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope. the program was run using a Dell Optiplex755 server (Round Rock, TX) water was position-restrained using a force constant (kpr) of 1000 kJ mol1nm2. the protein was placed in the box at least 1.0 nm from the box edge. the box was defined as a cube. hydrophobic non polar contributions to solvation free energy calculated as: Where SASA is the solvent accessible surface area and, and b are constants. a total 1,000 snapshots were extracted from 20,000 frames obtained in 10 ns of production run. EGCG was serially diluted into the running buffer to create a series of concentrations. the binding responses were continuously recorded in RU at a frequency of 1 HZ as sensorgrams and were expressed as a function of time. two 10-min washes in TBST were performed after secondary antibody labeling. boxes were manually placed surrounding each band of interest. the intra-lane background intensity was subtracted using Odyssey 3.0 analytical software. cells were treated with different concentrations of neutrophil elastase and/or EGCG. cells were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells/well. after incubation in neutrophil elastase and/or EGCG, 10 l of the solution was added to each well. the rate of cell migration was evaluated using the transwell migration assay. cells were seeded on glass coverslips in an environment containing 5% CO2 in air at 37 \u00b0C and then incubated in 10 nM neutrophil elastase. the immunostained specimens were observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) the immunostained specimens were observed under a TCS-SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) the program was run using a Dell Optiplex755 server (Round Rock, TX) a threshold of 1 4 nm was used for the van der Waals interactions. the non-bonded pair lists were updated every 0.010 ps. the coordinates were saved every 1 ps. a total 1,000 snapshots were extracted from 20,000 frames in 10 ns of production run. this allows not only to sample the flexibility of the binding site, but also to obtain a more reliable free energy estimate of binding. the binding affinity of EGCG to HNE in vitro was assayed using the SPR-based Biacore 3000 instrument. EGCG was serially diluted into the running buffer to create a series of concentrations. the samples were injected into the channels at a flow rate of 30 l/min. the binding responses were continuously recorded in RU at a frequency of 1 HZ as sensorgrams. 125 l of substrate solution (1.4 mM N-MeO-Suc-Ala-Pro-Val-p-NA) was added to 405 l of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 50 l of extract solution. the reaction was terminated via the addition of 500 l of soybean trypsin inhibitor solution (0.2 mg/ml in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5), and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. the results from the MTS proliferation assay showed that neutrophil elastase at a concentration of at least 20 nM enhanced tumor cell viability. among all the concentrations tested, 40 nM neutrophil elastase displayed the strongest effect. however, in the wound healing assays, the cells treated with 10 or 20 M EGCG migrated at a much slower rate than the control cells. the cells treated with the indicated concentrations of EGCG for 24 h were assessed for viability via the MTS assay. EGCG did not affect the viability of the HNE (10 nM)-induced A549 cells. the results represent the means S.E.M. of triplicate experiments. EGCG inhibits the HNE-induced regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. EGCG regulated the HNE-induced change in the expression of EMT markers. cells were grown to 60% confluence and then incubated in 20 M EGCG, 4 M sivelestat sodium and/or 10 nM neutrophil elastase for 24 h. EGCG potentially formed hydrogen bonds with SER166, THR165, ARG217 and ARG178. the binding mode of EGCG in the LBD of HNE provided detailed structural insight into the interaction between this compound and the HNE protein. EGCG-HNE complex from 20 nm to 30 nm (D) were analyzed to reflect the distribution of EGCG molecules surrounding HNE. the binding affinity of EGCG to HNE was determined using SPR biosensor technology. real-time measurements of binding affinity of EGCG to neutrophil elastase were outperformed using a Biacore 3000 instrument. representative sensorgrams were obtained by injecting EGCG at a concentration of 7.5, 15, 30, 60 or 120 M (curves from bottom to top) EGCG was injected for 30 s, and dissociation was monitored for more than 120 s. EGCG attenuates the neutrophil elastase-induced cell migration via the PI3K/Akt pathway. EGCG attenuates the neutrophil elastase-induced cell migration via the PI3K/Akt pathway. pAkt (Thy308)/Akt ratio (D), pAkt (Ser473)/Akt ratio (E) and pPI3K/PI3K ratio (F) were cropped from the same gel. the images for p-PI3K, p-Akt (T308) and GAPDH were cropped from the same gel. the group treated with 10 nM neutrophil elastase displayed significantly more migrating A549 cells than the control group. treatment with either 10 or 20 M EGCG (after exposure to 10 nM neutrophil elastase) resulted in dramatically fewer migrating A549 cells than the control group. the cells treated with the indicated concentrations of EGCG for 24 h were assessed for viability using the MTS assay. EGCG did not affect the viability of the HNE (10 nM)-induced migration of A549 cells. EGCG inhibits the HNE-induced regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. vimentin expression was significantly altered after HNE treatment. but as the specific inhibitor of HNE sivelestat sodium significantly up-regulated the expression of vimentin. the cells were labeled with an anti-human antibody, a DyLight 488-conjugated secondary antibody and the Hoechst 33342 stain (blue) the protein levels of vimentin were clearly down-regulated in response to EGCG treatment with or without HNE. a crystal structure of HNE bound to a selective inhibitor (PDB ID: 2Z7F) was selected. the time-averaged normalized ratio of the gyration radius (A), the RMSD (B), the number of hydrogen bonds (C) and the average structure of EGCG-HNE complex from 20 nm to 30 nm (D) were analyzed to reflect the distribution of EGCG molecules surrounding HNE. 165.9 14.3 60.5 15.0 172.6 20.4 18.0 1.3 71.8 12.4 Eelec: Van der Waal energy; Evdw Electrostattic energy; Gpolar: Polar solvation energy; Gbinding: Binding energy. binding affinity of EGCG to HNE was determined using SPR biosensor technology. EGCG was injected at a concentration of 7.5, 15, 30, 60 or 120 M. dissociation was monitored for more than 120 s. EGCG inhibits the enzymatic activity of neutrophil elastase. Western blot assays were used to assess whether the AAT protein levels were altered by EGCG in A549 cells. EGCG (20 M) enhanced the protein levels of IRS-1 and reduced phosphorylation of Akt and PI3K in the neutrophil elastase-stimulated A549 cells. the data are presented as the means SEM; n = 3. **P 0.01;***P 0.001. the images for IRS-1, AAT and GAPDH were cropped from the same gel. all gels were electrophoresed using the identical experimental conditions. neutrophil elastase is considered to be responsible for the elastolytic damage in emphysema25. recent reports showed that modest levels of neutrophil elastase led to the uncontrolled proliferation of lung epithelial tumor cells. the interaction between EGCG and HNE may not involve instantaneous binding but rather may be a long term interaction. EGCG exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the activity of neutrophil elastase. primary function of AAT is the inhibition of neutrophil elastase. EGCG inhibits neutrophil elastase-induced cell migration in vitro. neutrophil elastase released by activated neutrophils within the lung is absorbed by adjacent epithelial tumor cells and degrades IRS-1. the suppression of Akt and ERK1/2 has been thought to mediate the anti-tumor migration property of EGCG37. EGCG inhibits the activity of neutrophil elastase by directly binding to neutrophil elastase. EGCG enhances the expression of AAT by up-regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. EGCG reverses human neutrophil elastase-induced migration in A549 cells by directly binding to HNE and by regulating 1-AT."}
