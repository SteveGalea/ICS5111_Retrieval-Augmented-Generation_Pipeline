{"summary": "avian reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) is classified as a member of the genus Gammaretrovirus in the family Retroviridae. it causes an immunosuppressive, onogenic and runting-stunting syndrome in multiple avian hosts. veterinary medicine studies have investigated host gene transcriptional responses to infection by various avian viruses. a total of 1,785 differentially expressed genes were identified. a total of 1,785 differentially expressed genes were identified. a total of 1,785 differentially expressed genes were identified. RNA isolation and array hybridisation Cellular and viral RNAs were extracted using the AxyPrep Multisource Total RNA Miniprep Kit (AXYGEN, China) samples were quantified using a spectrophotometer and maintained at -70\u00b0C for future use. RNA integrity numbers were obtained to assign values to RNA measurements in an unambiguous manner. qRT-PCR targeting of selected cellular genes was performed using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, China) the optimal primers were synthesised by Invitrogen (Shanghai, China), and their sequences are listed in Table 1. the virus was propagated on a monolayer of primary CEFs prepared from 10-day-old specific-pathogen free (SPF) chicken embryos. the cells were washed three times and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium. 1% foetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO, China) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. all cell cultures were seeded simultaneously. cell cultures were harvested at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days post-infection. genespring was employed to perform a basic analysis of raw data. differentially expressed genes were then identified based on fold-changes. threshold for up- and down-regulated genes was a fold change > = 2.0 and a P value = 0.05. all samples were run in duplicate to guarantee the reproducibility of the amplification. the results showed that weak fluorescence could be observed beginning at 3 days post-infection. uninfected CEFs were observed to be uneven in shape with poor proliferative activity. Detection of REV group antigen in infected monolayer of CEFs was visualised. 77 genes were identified and sorted by data analysis based on the highest standard deviation using the mean values of all time points. hierarchical and K-means clustering resulted in the identification of 9 distinct patterns of transcript variations at the four different time-points. thus, expression pattern of most differentially expressed transcripts was similar and formed in two clusters, Cluster 5 and Cluster 7 in Fig 3. functional analysis revealed that 139 GO terms in the biological process category, 23 GO terms in the cellular component category, and 24 GO terms in the molecular functions category were significantly enriched (P 0.05). these results provide an overview of the host response to REV infection with respect to the top 10 enriched GO terms of differentially expressed genes in each category. genes gga04060:Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction 31 1.16E-03 TNFRSF6B, LOC422316, IL1R2, IL22RA1, OSMR, TNFRSF15, KITLG, TNFRSF8, CX3CL1, CCL5, CXCL12, IFNA3, TNFRSF11B, CXCR4, IL10RA, TNFRSF19, CSF3R, IL KGEE Pathways Gene Count P-Value Genes gga04010:MAPK signaling pathway 27 4.99E-01 FGFR2, TRAF2, IL1R2, FGFR3, FGF14, FGF16, TGFB3, FGF10, NFKB1, FGF13, FGF12, NFKB2, MAP3K4, RAC2, PAK1, PRKACB, AKT3, PTPN5, CACNG4, CACNA2D3, CR4, GRK6, PDGFRA, BF2, GRK7, BF1, IL2RG, GRK5, MR1, CSF1R gga04630:Jak-STAT signaling pathway 19 1.41E-01 PTPN6, IL6, IL22RA1, OSMR, SOCS3, SOCS1, LIFR, STAT1, IL6RA, IFNA3, SPRY1, CNTF, PRLR, IL10RA, CSF3R total RNA was extracted from CEFs and analysed using real-time RT-PCR. we selected 11 genes including STAT1, ISG12-2, TLR-3, IL-6, and SOCS1. the overall results generally matched the microarray data. REV infection of CEFs Viral infection was confirmed by detecting the REV group antigen using IFA. the results showed that weak fluorescence could be observed beginning at 3 days post-infection. Detection of REV group antigen in infected monolayer of CEFs was visualised by IFA on day 1 (A), day 2 (B), day 3 (C), day 4 (D), day 5 (E), day 6 (F), day 7 (G) and day 10 (H) hierarchical and K-means clustering resulted in the identification of 9 distinct patterns of transcript variations at the four different time-points. thus, expression pattern of most differentially expressed transcripts was similar and formed in two clusters, Cluster 5 and Cluster 7 in Fig 3. a complete list of significantly changed transcripts in each cluster was shown in S2 Table. category, 23 GO terms in the cellular component category, and 24 GO terms in the molecular functions category were found to be significantly enriched (P 0.05) these results provide an overview of the host response to REV infection with respect to the top 10 enriched GO terms of differentially expressed genes in each category.

IL-6 has been shown to be up-regulated during infections with other retroviruses and avian immunosuppressive viruses[48, 49]. SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 are members of the STAT-induced STAT inhibitor family. the suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) family is involved in the inhibition of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway. cytokine receptor interactions, cell adhesion molecules, and the PPAR signalling pathway may be involved in mechanisms governing the interaction of REV and its host cell. this speculation may explain why chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with REV caused a chronic infection with morphological transformation but without cell killing. however, these steps require further testing and verification.
