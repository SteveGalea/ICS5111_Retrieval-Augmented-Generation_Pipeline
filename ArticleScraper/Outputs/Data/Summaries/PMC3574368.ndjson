{"summary": "most emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases of humans are zoonoses. most zoonoses originate in wildlife and are increasing over time. the relative importance of different groups of wildlife hosts in the emergence of zoonoses remains unclear. many species of bats have peridomestic habits, roosting in houses and other buildings, as well as trees in dense urban areas, leading to frequent human contact with bat excreta [16\u201318] despite speculation that bats are unusual in their potential to host zoonotic viruses, there are no quantitative comparative analyses to support this hypothesis. pathogens include hantaviruses (causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome; [24]) and arenaviruses (causing, e.g. lymphocytic choriomeningitis, Lassa fever and Argentine, Bolivian, Venezuelan and Brazilian haemorrhagic fevers. Viruses were classified as zoonotic or non-zoonotic; RNA or DNA; replicating in the cytoplasm or nucleus. more than double the number of viruses are known for Mus musculus than any other rodent species. IUCN has seven conservation status categories: least concern, near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild and extinct. the first three categories described all the bats in our analysis, and \u2018least concern\u2019 and \u2018vulnerable\u2019 described all the rodents. we categorized migratory status of bats as: (i) species that can be broadly categorized as sedentary or only local (approx. less than 100 km) migrants, (ii) species that can be generalized as regional migrants (approx. 100\u2013500 km), and (iii) species that can be categorized as long-distance migrants (greater than 500 km) analysis. the \u2018APE\u2019 package [39] in R [36] was used to calculate a phylogenetic correlation matrix in which each entry was a pairwise correlation between each pair of species based on their shared branch lengths of a mammalian phylogenetic supertree. the error term was set to this correlation matrix multiplied by an additional parameter, Pagel's, that was estimated (using \u2018optim\u2019 in R) to determine the strength of phylogenetic dependence Viruses were classified as zoonotic or non-zoonotic; RNA or DNA; replicating in the cytoplasm or nucleus. more than double the number of viruses are known for Mus musculus than any other rodent species, as a consequence of its use as a laboratory animal.
