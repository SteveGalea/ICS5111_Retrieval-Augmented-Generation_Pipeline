{"summary": "avian gammacoronavirus has been detected across an array of avian orders including anseriformes, Ciconiiformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, Galliformes, Passeriformes, Pelecaniformes. gammacoronavirus has been detected across an array of avian orders including anseriformes, Ciconiiformes, Columbi despite this assertion, limited studies have been performed to assess host species breadth, seasonal prevalence, geographic distribution, or genetic structuring. in this study we aimed to sample a range of waterbirds from Scandinavia for the presence of CoV. screening and characterization of CoV Viral RNA was extracted using the MagAttract Viral RNA M48 extraction kit and the M48 Robot (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) were generated using methods described in [14] or [15], and sequences generated in this study have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KT882615-28. all waterfowl species in this study were captured using a large baited trap. samples were collected using a sterile tipped applicator. samples were placed in Virus Transport Media (Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution) 764 birds from 11 species of Anserifomes (ducks, geese, swans, n = 691) and 11 species of Charadriiformes (gulls, terns, shorebirds, n = 143) were sampled. the prevalence of CoV was high, at 18.7%, but species, groups and orders were unevenly represented. common Eider Somateria mollissima 10 1 (10) Long-tailed Duck Clangula hyemalis 1 0 Geese Brent Goose Branta bernicla 11 3 (27.3) Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis 6 0 Shelducks Common Shelduck Tadorna tadorna 5 1 (20) Anseriformes total 691 142 (20.5) Charadriiformes, La 8/10 sequences from mallards in 2007 were most closely related (within 98\u201399% identity) to CoV sequences from mallards at Ottenby in 2011. a single mallard CoV sequence (69740) was in a differentiated clade, most similar to sequences from Hong Kong and more distantly China. high prevalence of coronavirus in anseriformes A total of 764 birds from 11 species of Anserifomes (ducks, geese, swans, n = 691) and 11 species of Charadriiformes (gulls, terns, shorebirds, n = 143) were sampled. the prevalence of CoV was high, at 18.7%.

(2011), so it is unclear whether this pattern of high prevalence is present globally. we found a low prevalence in waders, which is in contrast to [14] and [21], which found a very high prevalence (>20%) in waders, but corroborates findings in [22, 25, 26]. avian coronavirus RNA-dependant RNA polymerase phylogeny shows no spatial, temporal or host species patterns. in the northern Hemisphere waterfowl species, especially dabbling and diving ducks are important in the epidemiology of avian coVs. coronavirus reference sequences. click here for additional data file."}
