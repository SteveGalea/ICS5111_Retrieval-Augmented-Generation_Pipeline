{"summary": "structural data on the arrangement, stoichiometry and organisation of the component molecules of filoviruses has until now been lacking. the present study provides unique insights into the structure of this deadly pathogen. most viruses, irrespective of their architecture, appear to have evolved to encapsidate only a single copy of their genome within the protein or protein/lipid shell. some strains of influenza can produce elongated virions, but there is a mechanism that selectively encapsidates only one set of genome segments. three proteins, VP24, VP35 and NP are essential for nucleocapsid formation. the three-dimensional structure and molecular arrangements have not been previously determined. research on filoviruses has been hampered by their status as biosafety level 4 pathogens. the flash-freezing at liquid ethane temperatures used in cryo-electron microscopy preserves the structural and molecular detail. digital image processing reveals the 3D organization of EBOV, including the structural arrangement of component molecules at resolutions of 14\u201319. a helical nucleocapsid gives an internal \u201cherring-bone\u201d appearance. configurations are \u201csingle\u201d particles, containing a nucleocapsid of uniform length, and \u201clinked\u201d virions composed of a series single-genome nucleocapsids connected by short sections of empty envelope. negative staining can cause drying and staining artefacts which hamper accurate measurements and preclude 3D analysis. a region filtered to emphasize the nucleocapsid is indicated and numbered. each genome copy is indicated and numbered, the red arrows show transition points between nucleocapsids. the circular holes appear as lighter regions and the support film appears dark grey. 3D schematics of these structures highlighting the RNA and protein composition and the diameter of these structures, at the same scale for comparison to (E). the insets in (G) are image averages of the nucleocapsid (bottom), and the entire width of the virus (top). colour-coded arrows in (A\u2013H) highlight equivalent features in the 2D analysis shown in Fig. 2. Figure 4. Sub-tomogram averaging of Ebola virus. sections of the density map of the sub-tomogram average are shown from the top sliced just below the envelope (A), the middle of the virus (B), a side view of the virus (C), and an end-on slice (D). single genome (G1) virus and multi-genome particles are shown budding from the cell. the color-coding is as follows: nucleocapsids, red, yellow and orange helices; nucleocapsid protein, purple spheres; VP40, green ovals; VP24/VP35 bridges; blue oval; microtubules, brown. EBOV nucleocapsid is a right-handed double-layered helix with an outer diameter of 41 nm and a hollow inner channel 16 nm in diameter. the inner nucleocapsid, composed of large subunits, is linked by vertical and horizontal contacts between the large subunits. the NP subunits are linked by an outer horizontal layer at a diameter of 37 nm. this layer consists of a ring of bridges between adjacent large subunits. the bridges joining the NP subunits are composed of two lobes, one of which is slightly bigger than the other. the recombinant nucleocapsid data indicates that both VP35-VP30-VP24-NP and VP35-VP24-NP produce approximately 50 nm diameter helical structures that are indistinguishable from nucleocapsids produced by EBOV. this indicates that VP30 does not increase the diameter of the nucleocapsid. a model of the 18.9 kb EBOV genome with the RNA following a circular fixed radius would make a nucleocapsid containing one copy of the EBOV genome about 914 nm long. this fits closely with the 982 nm length class (53% of the particles observed in this study) the majority of the virus particles fall into size categories that are a multiple of the putative single genome length (G1). the membrane envelope is constricted at the transition point where the nucleocapsid ends and the empty membrane tube begins. both full and empty virions have a continuous layer of spikes projecting from the surface. the majority of virions are linear (Figures 1, S1A, S5), others have a \u201ccomma-shaped\u201d appearance. d\u201d, filamentous forms [34] were rarely observed: these consist of empty tubes. it is possible that centrifugal virus purification disrupted most branched structures. both the nucleocapsid and the VP40 layers are ordered. however the contacts between them appear to be non-symmetrical. a virion of 982 nm would have about 1888 copies of the GP spike. a genome of 18.9 kbp with 13 bases per NP gives 1454 molecules of NP, VP24, VP30, and VP35 per virion respectively. GP spike Cleavage of GP results in two domains: GP1 containing the receptor binding domain and GP2 that contains the fusion and transmembrane domains. the structure of a smaller engineered fragment of GP1\u2013GP2 has recently been determined by x-ray crystallography. the mucin-like domains (connected at V310 and E502 - shown in Green in Figure 5) completely fill the previously described bowl-like chalice which contains the putative receptor binding sites. each mucin-like domain has an \u201carm-like\u201d projection, which extends radially at the distal end of the spike, to a maximum diameter of 13 nm. polyploidy has been shown to increase infectivity rates in filoviruses. a complex double layered helical nucleocapsid appears to be unique to filoviruses. filamentous morphology may have evolutionary implications by allowing genome length flexibility. helical nucleocapsid has a uniform helical structure (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4) and is enveloped by a membrane coated by an external layer of GP spikes. from the same image data set, we combined extracted volumes from tomograms with 2-D single particle processing to determine the structure of the GP spikes. variable in the overall length of virions is non-random, and they fit into ordered size classes. a total of 2090 virions with continuous nucleocapsids (no obvious segmentations) were measured. a single G1-single/comma shaped EBOV is shown (inset on the right, G1 = 1 copy of genome) 3D reconstruction of the nucleocapsid with the same colour scheme as in (A) the location of the inner nucleocapsid, and the bridge are indicated. the reconstruction is presented at a volume threshold that would encompass a single copy of each of these proteins and the viral RNA. a single X\u2013Y slice cutting through the central region of the virus. a X\u2013Z average of 50 slices showing a cross section of the virus. the insets in (G) are image averages of the nucleocapsid (bottom) and the entire width of the virus (top). color coding as follows; beige, lipid envelope; green, membrane associated proteins (VP40); blue and purple, outer and inner nucleocapsid. color-coding is as follows: nucleocapsids, red, yellow and orange helices; nucleocapsid protein, purple spheres; VP40. the polyploidy we have observed in EBOV is a peculiarity of the particular viral isolate or of the Vero cell line that we used for this investigation. it is also unlikely that the polyploidy we have observed in EBOV is a peculiarity of the particular viral isolate or of the Vero cell line that we used for this investigation. the EBOV nucleocapsid is a right-handed double-layered helix with an outer diameter of 41 nm and a hollow inner channel 16 nm in diameter. the horizontal contacts occur between the large subunits at a diameter of 22.3 nm. the horizontal contacts are linked by an outer horizontal layer at a diameter of 37 nm. VP35, VP30, VP24, and NP were transfected together. approximately 50 nm diameter helical nucleocapsid-like structure was also generated. NP alone generated helical NP-RNA complexes 20\u201325 nm in diameter. VP24 and VP35 are structural components of the bridge located on the periphery of the nucleocapsid. we propose that VP30 lies in the interior of the nucleocapsid and is not part of the bridge on the periphery of the nucleocapsid. this localization is consistent with previous work showing that VP30 is a component of the nucleocapsid, and associates with NP. the outer bridge centered at 37 nm is composed of VP24-VP35 heterodimers. a single-genome virus particle of 980 nm gives an estimated length for a single-genome virus particle of 980 nm. the majority of the virus particles fall into size categories that are a multiple of the putative single genome length (G1) internal vesicles of 20\u201340 nm in size are also sometimes observed at the ends of virions. these vesicles appear to be formed during the process of envelopment of the nucleocapsid. it is possible that centrifugal virus purification disrupted most branched structures previously with negative staining of cell culture supernatant. tomography also shows discrete areas of connectivity between nucleocapsid and matrix protein layers. helical nucleocapsid is clearly identified in the structure, including the gap between the envelope-VP40, and the nucleocapsid-VP40. the wide spacing of the EBOV GP in the viral envelope allows plenty of space for free access and binding of any neutralizing antibodies directed at both the club-shaped head and stem region without stearic hindrance. a genome of 18.9 kbp with 13 bases per NP with a single genome copy gives 1454 molecules of NP, VP24, VP30, and VP35 per virion respectively. the spike is in situ in the viral membrane, thus the transmembrane region and base of the spike are less well defined than the distal region of the spike. the spike extends 10 nm from the surface of the envelope, with a club-shaped head 6.5 nm in height, and a 3.5 nm long stalk. the spike extends 10 nm from the surface of the envelope, with a club-shaped head 6.5 nm in height, and a the mucin-like domains are out of the way and cannot interfere stearically with KZ52 Fab binding. this is consistent with previous studies showing that endosomal proteolysis plays a role in enhancing infectivity. the other two major deletions in the 3CSY structure are situated at the midpoint of the structure just above the stalk. polyploidy has been shown to increase infectivity rates in paramyxovirus and birnavirus. a complex double layered helical nucleocapsid appears to be unique to filoviruses. a filamentous morphology may have evolutionary implications by allowing genome length flexibility. cryo-electron microscopy Samples for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) were mixed with BSA coated 10 nm gold particles at a ratio of 21 (virusgold) for cryo-EM. Specimens (4 l) were applied to glow-discharged quantifoil grids with 2 m holes spaced at 1 m intervals. data were collected within tilt ranges of 60\u00b0, or 52\u00b0, with a total dose/tomographic data set of 47\u201360 electrons/2. for cryo-EM, data collection was done using the Xplore3D data acquisition software, the low-dose unit, and the TIA software (FEI Company, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) this procedure involves the selection of ten to twenty of the 10 nm gold particles. the locations of these particles are then used in conjecture with the tilt angles of each image to globally align all of the images to each other. the last step in this process was to calculate the final three-dimensional reconstruction (tomogram) single particle cryo-EM image processing was carried out using the EMAN/EMAN2 and SPIDER/WEB image processing program packages [54], [55]. images were corrected for contrast transfer function (ctf) using the \u201ce2ctf.py\u201d function in the EMAN2 software package5, which estimates defocus and corrects for ctf by phase-flipping. this procedure requires an initial 3D helical reference structure. it was first pre-treated with a Gaussian mask to select only the nucleocapsid-containing region of the virus tomogram. the volume was rotated around the helical axis and translated along the axis of the nucleocapsid. the atomic resolution structure 3CSY.pdb was visualized using the UCSF Chimera software package. the 3D cryo-EM reconstructions, cryo-ET reconstructions, 3D models of the Ebola virus, and the atomic resolution structure 3CSY.pdb were visualized using the software package. cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) were mixed with BSA coated 10 nm gold particles. Specimens (4 l) were applied to glow-discharged quantifoil grids. grids were subsequently plunged in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV. data were collected within tilt ranges of 60\u00b0, or 52\u00b0, with a total dose/tomographic data set of 47\u201360 electrons/2. for cryo-EM, data collection was done using the Xplore3D data acquisition software, the low-dose unit, and the TIA software. this procedure involves the selection of ten to twenty of the 10 nm gold particles. the locations of these particles are then used in conjecture with the tilt angles of each image to globally align all images to each other. the last step in this process was to calculate the final three-dimensional reconstruction (tomogram) single particle cryo-EM image processing was carried out using the EMAN/EMAN2 and SPIDER/WEB image processing program packages. images were corrected for contrast transfer function (ctf) using the \u201ce2ctf.py\u201d function in the EMAN2 software package5. this procedure requires an initial 3D helical reference structure. this initial 3D structure was first pre-treated with a Gaussian mask. an auto correlation function was then performed in which the volume was rotated around the helical axis and translated along the axis of the virus tomogram. docking of the 3CSY.pdb [42] structure to the cryo-EM structure of the spike was done using the SITUS software package. the segmented volume was then used for the docking procedure using the \u2018colores\u2019 function in SITUS. the entire 3CSY.pdb structure which included the Fab of the KZ52 neutralizing antibody was superposed over the docked GP1/GP2 component of the structure. a single copy of the genome can be seen running through the center of the virus and curving at one end of the virus to form the globular head. in some heads there is a low-density region (LD) devoid of nucleocapsid. in others, the nucleocapsid is sharply bent where it folds back on itself. the last panel shows the average of 53 slices which make up the volume encompassing the entire NC. the image and the average in the inset contain all structural components of the NC. this region of the envelope has a surface area of 15,651 nm2. eighty-six individual spikes were counted (white spheres) each spike would occupy an average area of 182 nm2. the reconstruction of the spike (blue) with the docked KZ52 Fab (purple) has been included.
