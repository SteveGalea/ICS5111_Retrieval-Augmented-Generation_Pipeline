{"summary": "global conflicts have raised concerns that pathogenic agents might be released deliberately by terrorist organizations or other entities. the majority of these new methods involve direct detection of microbial nucleic acids. most currently available methods for microbial detection and discovery are based on three technologies. the high-density arrays available at present are able to test for the presence of thousands of different organisms simultaneously, at a cost less than US$ 100 per sample. Arrays can be designed with a combination of high-specificity probes and probes designed against conserved regions. cross-hybridization between probes and similar but non-identical sequences allows detection of novel species. Arrays may be subdivided with a gasket into subarrays, allowing multiple samples to be tested on one slide. negative control probes with random sequences are included, to provide a threshold level for background noise correction. the ViroChip is fabricated by mechanically spotting synthesized oligoucleotides on a glass slide. the oligos are 70-mers, usually selected to match sequences common to a taxonomic family, but not found in other families. the ViroChip could be used to identify novel viruses within the same family as a known, sequenced virus. the resequencing pathogen microarray for tropical and emerging infectious agents (RPM-TEI v1.0) [15] contains probes for a wider variety of pathogens and known toxin genes. the disadvantages of the RPM approach are its lower sensitivity (due in part to the use of short oligos) hybridizations were performed at low temperatures (23\u00b0C) to compensate for the extremely short probe length. oligos were synthesized on arrays using a photocatalytic process similar to that used on the NimbleGen platform. pathogenic bacteria, fungi and protozoa comprised 29 495 60-mer oligos. the target sequences were chosen from the 16S ribosomal RNA genes of bacteria and 18S rRNAs of fungi and protozoa. the sensitivity of these arrays was comparable to that of the ViroChip series. probes are selected from target genomes by one of two strategies. \u2018Discovery\u2019 probes match genome regions that are unique to a taxonomic family or subfamily. they are optimized for forensic use, to identify the specific strain of organism in a sample as precisely as possible. the ViroChip is fabricated by mechanically spotting synthesized oligoucleotides on a glass slide. the oligos are 70-mers, usually selected to match sequences common to a taxonomic family, but not found in other families. advantages of the ViroChip platform include the low cost of spotted oligo arrays, and its ability to detect novel viruses within a known family. the latest version of the ViroChip addresses these issues by using the Agilent ink-jet array platform [11]. resequencing microarrays Another approach to pathogen detection uses resequencing microarrays [12,13] oligos were synthesized on arrays using a photocatalytic process. hybridizations were performed at low temperatures (23\u00b0C) to compensate for the extremely short probe length. oligos were synthesized on arrays using a photocatalytic process. greeneChip arrays represent a broader-spectrum approach to pathogen detection [17, 18]. these are high-density oligonucleotide arrays, fabricated using the Agilent inkjet system. the most comprehensive pathogen detection arrays reported to date were designed by a team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [19, 20]. initial versions of the Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array (LLMDA) contained target probes for all bacteria and viruses. more recent versions also include probes for pathogenic fungi and protozoa. the LLMDA was shown to have high sensitivity and specificity when tested against a variety of previously characterized viral and bacterial cultures. it was also used successfully to detect adventitious porcine circovirus DNA in a pediatric rotavirus vaccine [21] Detection array analysis offers the opportunity to understand microarray behavior in much greater detail. the samples analyzed are produced from genomic DNA. if the scanner photomultiplier tube gain is set too high, a substantial amount of information about the true probe intensities may be lost. greeneLAMP algorithm makes several key assumptions about array experiments. probe intensities are log-normally distributed; probe intensities represent independent measurements of target genome concentrations. number of probes for any species having positive signals is limited, on the order of 100 or fewer. the greeneLAMP algorithm was moderately successful in the analysis of viral samples. it is difficult to assess its performance independently from that of the chip design. the failure of the GreeneChip platform to precisely identify bacteria can be partially explained by the cross-reactivity of ribosomal RNA probes. the normalized intensity vector is then compared to the normalized energy vector for each target. the target having the highest similarity score is then predicted to be present in the array sample. the authors assume that the underlying null distribution is exactly log normal. VIPR is a technique developed for analysis of viral diagnostic microarrays. it is essentially a nave Bayes classifier, based on the assumption that probe intensities follow a log-normal distribution with one of two sets of parameters for each probe. the binding predictions are obtained by calculating free energies G with a nearest-neighbor approach, and treating probes with G below a fixed threshold as 'on' DetectiV DetectiV [35] is a software package written in the R language [36] which provides simple visualization, normalization and significance testing functions for detection array data. it is not tightly coupled to any particular array platform, and runs in any computing environment that supports the R language. PhyloDetect groups targets into a nested hierarchy based on the similarity of their column vectors in the match matrix. targets that are indistinguishable (because their match vectors are identical) are collapsed. phyloDetect reduces probe intensities to binary indicators. composite likelihood maximization is based on a biophysical model of probe-target hybridization. CLiMax models the likelihood of the observed pattern of probe intensities as a function of the set of targets present in the sample. the probability is estimated as a product of probe-specific factors. the model predictors are fitted to data from hybridizations to targets with known genome sequences. it measures sequence complexity by the entropy of the frequency distribution of trimers in the probe sequence. the likelihood of Xj given the observed data Y = Yi is where provided that, at most, one target genome is present in the sample. the four human papillomavirus strains listed first have scores substantially above zero, indicating their likely presence in the sample. the four types of human papillomavirus strains listed first have scores substantially above zero, indicating their likely presence in the sample. the greedy target selection algorithm may lead to erroneous predictions in some cases. microarray data analysis focused on the use of arrays to measure gene expression [22] to infer changes in messenger RNA concentration in cells or tissues, resulting from changing experimental conditions. most work on expression data analysis was aimed at background correction [23], normalization [24] and estimation of concentration ratios (fold changes) between different conditions [25]. greeneLAMP algorithm makes several key assumptions about array experiments. 'log-transformed analysis of microarrays using P-values' (GreeneLAMP) [17] is one such approach. n P-values are computed for each taxon using the QFAST algorithm. this step depends crucially on the independence assumption. the product of the n P-values is used as a test statistic. bind to a target genome fragment are computed using a nearest-neighbor stacking energy method [33] and are then scaled to produce a vector within the unit hypercube. to identify the target hybridized to an array, E-Predict normalizes the probe intensities yi to sum to sum to 1: alternative methods (sum, quadratic and unit vector) may be used to normalize both intensities and free energies. VIPR VIPR is a technique developed for analysis of viral diagnostic microarrays. it is essentially a nave Bayes classifier, based on the assumption that probe intensities follow a log-normal distribution with one of two sets of parameters for each probe. the binding predictions are obtained by calculating free energies G with a nearest-neighbor approach. VIPR is not designed to deal with complex samples, where a mixture of targets might be present. the requirement that parameters be fitted to data from arrays hybridized to each candidate target limits its usefulness for broad-spectrum microbial detection arrays. PhyloDetect does not correct P-values for multiple testing. it does not define threshold values for 'detection' of a particular species. DetectiV may therefore be regarded as a useful package for exploratory data analysis. s below the detection threshold is the complement of the cumulative binomial distribution, and the group is predicted to be absent if the likelihood is below. phyloDetect is designed to work with data for any detection array. it is available as a web application provided by the authors. CLiMax reduces probe intensities to binary variables, which are described by a logistic regression model. the logistic regression model also includes a term to account for the observation that probes with low sequence complexity are more likely to hybridize nonspecifically to dissimilar targets. iterations continue until a preset maximum or until no additional increase in the likelihood is possible. viral strains annotated in red boldface are those with positive log-odds scores given the previously selected targets. the full length of each bar represents the log-odds score given the previously selected targets. the greedy target selection algorithm may lead to erroneous predictions in some cases, when the sample contains a species for which the target database contains both complete genomes and single replicons. algorithm preferentially allocate log-odds contributions from positive probes to complete genomes, even though the probes may match a single-replicon sequence more closely. microarrays are emerging as a cost-effective, broad-spectrum platform for detection of pathogens in clinical and environmental samples, foods, pharmaceuticals and other products. applications of detection microarrays in food safety and medical settings will require the development of tools to assess the quality of array hybridizations."}
