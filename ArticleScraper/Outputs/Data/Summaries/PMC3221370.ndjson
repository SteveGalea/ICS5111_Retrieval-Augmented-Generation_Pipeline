{"summary": "a protozoan parasite causes dysentery and amoebic liver abscess (ALA) disease in humans. it is responsible for 40, 000 to 100, 000 deaths annually, ranking it as the second highest cause of mortality attributed to a protozoan parasitic disease. a fragment of the Gal-lectin heavy subunit named LC3 (52kDa) has been shown to be one of the main targets for IgG and IgA anti-Gal lectin antibodies recovered from patient s serum and feces, respectively 14-16. LC3 fragment conferred protection in gerbils against ALA (71%) following intraperitoneal immunization before intraportal challenge with virulent trophozoites 8. diversse viral vectors have been studied to this end. one of the most promising is Autographa Californica, an insect enveloped DNA nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV) which can drive the expression of foreign genes in mammalian cells without causing cytotoxic effects. axenic HM1: IMSS trophozoites were maintained in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 15% of adult bovine serum (Biofluids International Inc., MD, USA) in anaerobic conditions and incubated at 37\u00b0C. spodoptera frugiperda was cultivated as monolayer or suspension in Grace's medium (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) PCR product was cloned into Hind III/XbaI sites of plasmid pBlueCMV 42 to generate the construct pBlueCMV-LC3. the recombinant baculovirus AcNPV-LC3 was generated by recombination of the cassette with AcNPV DNA following the manufacturer s instructions of the Bac-N-Blue Transfection Kit. baculovirus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation in a SW28 rotor (Beckman) at 141, 000 g and 4\u00b0C during 90 min. subsequently, the virus-containing interphase layer was collected, diluted in PBS, centrifuged as before and the pelleted virus titered by using a plaque assay following the manufacturer s instructions. the antibodies were used to 1:1000 dilution. animals were divided in 6 groups of 19 hamsters each. two non-treated groups were maintained free of pathogens. 106 trophozoites in 100 l PBS were directly injected 43. the site of injection was immediately obtruded by applying a gel foam pad. intestine carefully returned to the abdominal cavity and the abdominal layers sutured with surgical staples. the white cells, mostly lymphocytes, were cultivated at 105 cells/well in 96-well plates in RPMI medium alone or stimulated with concanavalin A (1 g/well), or amebic total extract (50 g/well), at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for 72 h. all the treatments were carried out by triplicate for each animal. Western blot on transduced cells showed recognition of a band with a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa. no band was observed in non-transduced cells extract (B, line 3). 11 out of 19 O AcNPV-LC3 and 4 out of 19 N AcNPV-LC3 immunized hamsters did not show any macroscopic evidence of ALA development. in contrast, numerous ALA covering most of the liver s four lobes tissue were clearly evident in all non-immunized sham animals. in general, abscesses were more localized (mostly in one lobe) and smaller, suggesting partial protection. average liver weight of the O AcNPV-LC3 group was also different from the O AcNPV-WT group (mean of 12 gr; p0.005) but not different from the uninfected non-treated group (5gr) no statistical differences in liver weight between the N AcNPV-LC3 group and its respective WT group were observed. slight sterilizing protection was observed in hamsters receiving WT baculovirus for oral route (O AcNPV-WT) partial protection was only observed in O AcNPV-LC3. a representative liver from an animal of the sham group is shown in G. Hematoxylin-eosin stained section from each liver is shown in B, D, F and H respectively. healthy liver tissue with no trophozoites was observed in the completely protected hamsters (A and B), in contrast with local (partially protected; C and D) and spread (unprotected; E to H) abscesses. anti-trophozoite antigen IgG antibodies were observed in serum from O AcNPV-LC3 and N AcNPV-LC3 groups after immunization. bars represent mean optical densities (n = 19) in heavy subunit were induced in the animals. no systemic response was observed in the sham and uninfected control groups. these result of high level of IgG antibodies in hamsters immunized by both routes with no clear differences between them. this suggests anti-LC3 IgG antibodies may be only partially responsible for protection against ALA. sham and uninfected control groups were immunized with baculovirus. a similar background proliferation was also found for sham and uninfected control groups. these results suggest that protection against ALA in hamsters was partially dependent on antibodies but strongly dependent on induction of a specific cellular immune response in spleen. eba IgG antibodies in sera and spleen cells proliferation were sufficient to avoid early colonization by trophozoites upon challenge. but complete protection against ALA was only correlated with the lymphoproliferation measured from spleens. no differences in the level of anti-amoeba IgG antibodies were found when comparing protected versus unprotected AcNPV-LC3 immunized hamsters. the reason for the sterilizing protection observed in these two animals is unknown, but may be related to poor infection rates during the challenge with trophozoites. baculovirus activation of innate immunity is unlikely, because of the low number of animals protected in the control groups. studies of baculovirus cell targeting in immunized hamsters should be carried out in order to demonstrate in vivo transduction of APC and other immune cells by the baculovirus. previous studies of protection against intestinal and hepatic amoebiasis have used CT as adjuvant 51-53, a strong immune elicitor. the activation of iNKT, macrophages and Th1 cells is needed during an acute E. histolytica infection in the liver parenchyma. a similar mechanism could prevent large intestine colonization by E. histolytica."}
