{"summary": "studies using macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) corroborate these findings. unravelling the effect of genes and their level of significance during acute SIV infection is key in understanding the mechanisms by which these viruses interact with the immune system. the changes in gene expressions are essentially caused by SIV infection. this suggests that the mRNA measurements should be correlated with time since infection or SIV RNA in plasma. this suggests that multiple genes work together to orchestrate the immune response during acute SIV infection. the advantages and disadvantages of these different normalization strategies were discussed in detail in [13,19]. we combine a variety of preprocessing techniques with two popular multivariate analysis methods to develop a set of twelve \u201cjudges\u201d. each of the twelve judges observes the data distinctively from others, and provides a set of uncorrelated principal components (PCs) a \u201cjudge\u201d is defined as the combination of a transformation, a normalization technique and a multivariate analysis method. each dataset is analyzed by 12 different judges, forming a Multiplexed Component Analysis (MCA) each judge provides a model consisting of a set of principal components (PCs) for each judge, the two PCs that provide the most accurate and robust classification are chosen for further analysis. in this manuscript, we either use the original raw data (Orig) or perform log2-transformation on the data (Log2) normalization of the data is common because the typical amount and the range of expression for each gene in the datasets can vary substantially. the type of normalization used alters the type of gene expression changes that are assumed to be significant, which in turn is related to how these gene expression changes can affect the immune response. x takes its value from Orig, Log2, y takes its value from MC, UV, CV, and z takes its value from PCA, PLS. we use * to denote all the possible options for a particular triple element. the dataset for each tissue (spleen, MLN, PBMC) was analyzed by all 12 judges. genes that are highly loaded on PC1 and PC2 contribute more to the scores in the score plots. for example, type I interferons (IFN1 and IFN) and interferon-stimulated genes (MxA, OAS1, OAS2) are rapidly and significantly upregulated during the first days of SIV infection. judges testing the spleen dataset are shown in S3 Information (score plots) and Fig 3 (loading plots) the judges have distinct interpretations of the spleen. each judge emphasizes a unique type of change in gene expression. the shapes of the gene clouds calculated by each judge are different. the 12 judges identify both consensus and judge-specific genes. loading plots on PC1 and PC2 are shown for each judge. in the first column (MC), there is no single gene with a significantly high loading. the CV scaling method preprocesses genes to have their variance equal to the square of the coefficient of variation of the original genes. the MC normalization method does not modify the variance of variables at all. the 3rd column of judges shares features with both the first and second columns, i.e., a few highly loaded genes. PC1 and PC2 are the most commonly chosen classifier PCs. the PC1-PC2 pair is chosen in 25 out of 72 cases, followed by PC1-PC3 and PC1-PC4 each chosen in 9 cases. the results of clustering for both classification schemes are shown in the score plots in S3 Information. rig vs. log2, MC vs. UV vs. CV, and PCA vs. PLS. each judge has merit and can outperform others in some cases. each judge has merit and can outperform others. genes are sorted based on the average of their 12 ranks in Fig 5A\u20135C (time since infection) and panels A-C in S4 Information (SIV RNA in plasma) to find the overall contribution of genes, the genes are also sorted based on the average of their three overall ranks. the highly loaded genes contribute more to the scores that are used for classification. each gene is assigned a rank (highest 1; lowest 88) from each judge. each gene is assigned a rank (highest 1; lowest 88) for each gene. in 11 out of 12 cases, the top genes selected by MCA have substantially better classification power than those selected by the Pearson or Spearman correlation methods. in most cases the classification power top 5 average-ranked genes selected by all the judges is equally well or better than that of the top 5 genes selected by each individual judge (S10 Information) the average of 4 ranks given by each class of the judges was calculated. this results in three ranks for each gene, representing the importance of that gene to each class of the judges. genes in the center have equal importance to all three classes of the judges. in each hexagonal plot, three main vertices represent MC-, UV-, and CV-based judges. genes close to one of these vertices have equal importance to both CV- and MC-based judges. the highest contributing group of genes consists of MxA, OAS2, OAS1 and CCL8. in the second top contributing gene cluster, the lowest p-value, 0.23, belongs to the paired t-test between CXCL11 and IRF7. mRNA measurements from more animals could lead to lower p-values, smaller gene clusters and more statistically significant gene rankings. the results of the tests, p-values, range from 1 (black) to 0 (the light copper color) lower p-values suggest a more statistically significant difference between the contribution of genes. the clusters, colored alternately dark and light blue along the vertical axis, determine the genes that are significantly different from genes in other clusters. the judges have a high degree of agreement on the gene correlations in the spleen dataset (Fig 8A and Fig 8D) this is followed by the MLN and PBMC datasets, respectively. for both classification schemes, the judges have a high degree of agreement on the gene correlations in the spleen dataset. the first two PCs capture more than 70% of the variance. they can create a plane that closely approximates the matrix. the cosine of the angle between any two genes is approximately equal to the corresponding correlation coefficient in the matrix [28] the first and second PCs capture more than 96% of the variance in the average correlation coefficient matrix (panel A in S16 Information) the complete gene expression profiles are shown in S18 Information. genes with the same color show similar patterns of correlation with other genes. the radius of each dot is linearly inversely proportional to the square root of MSD. in panel A, specific examples of gene expression dynamics typical of each cluster are shown. the congested region in the center of the hexagon houses most of the genes. for both classification schemes, we observe the top contributing genes such as CCL8, MxA, CXCL10, CXCL11, OAS2 and OAS1 lie in the center of the plot. this suggests that type I interferon responses are quite similar in the three compartments and that these genes could be used as biomarkers to be measured in PBMCs. in each hexagonal plot, three main vertices represent Spleen, MLN, and PBMC. inner color of each gene shows its overall rank in all tissues. outer color represents the minimum of each gene\u2019s three ranks in the tissues. the MC normalization method emphasizes the genes with the highest absolute variations in mRNA measurements across animals. the MC normalization method emphasizes the genes with the highest absolute variations in mRNA measurements across animals. the UV normalization method is a popular method that gives equal weight to each variable in the dataset. Fig 2A shows a PC1-PC2 score plot of 24 observations (animals) in the spleen dataset analyzed by judge 2\u2014J2: (Orig, UV, PCA) together, these two principal components capture 57.5% of the variation in the dataset. plots are used to find correlated genes through clustering genes that are located in a particular direction. spleen dataset analyzed by judge 2\u2014J2: (Orig, UV, PCA). the loading plots are shown for the 12 judges. judge 4 is less dominated by a small number of highly-loaded genes than judge 1. a common feature of judges 1, 4, 7, and 10 is that the MC is the normalization method. a few highly loaded genes are observed in each plot and the rest of genes are located in a dense cloud. in the second column, there is no single gene with a significantly high loading and the cloud of genes is more spread out. the score and loading plots for the 12 judges in other datasets are available in S3 Information. the results of clustering for both classification schemes are shown in the score plots in S3 Information and summarized in Fig 4A. the results of clustering for both classification schemes are shown in the score plots in Fig 4A. classification rates are higher than 60% (mean = 69.2%) and the LOOCV rates are higher than 54%. this may suggest that measuring SIV RNA in plasma alone does not provide a good indicator for the changes in immunological events during SIV infection. each judge observes the data from a distinct viewpoint. we combine their opinions to identify significant genes during acute SIV infection. if a judge has a low accuracy, that judge can be removed from further analysis. the genes are sorted based on the average of their 12 ranks in Fig 5A\u20135C (time since infection) and panels A-C in S4 Information (SIV RNA in plasma) to find the overall contribution of genes, the genes are also sorted based on the average of their three overall ranks. calculate the average of twelve ranks for each gene and sort the results from the high-ranking genes (dark blue) to the low-ranking genes (dark red) in the (A) spleen, (B) MLN and (C) PBMC datasets. this leads to an overall rank for each gene in each of the datasets. in most cases the classification power top 5 average-ranked genes selected by all the judges is equally well or better than that of the top 5 genes selected by each individual judge (S10 Information) similar colors across a row show a high degree of consensus among judges, while there is a significant amount of disagreement between judges on rows with mixed colors, such as CCL24 in Fig 5A. the proximity of a gene to a vertex indicates that the gene has more importance to the class or classes of the judges noted at that vertex. the inner color of each dot represents the average of the ranks, whereas the outer color represents the minimum of the three ranks. the inner color of each dot represents the average of the three ranks given by each class of the judges. the outer color represents the minimum (best) of the three ranks. the congested regions in the center of the left hexagonal plots are shown in greater detail on the right. p-values of paired t-tests between consecutive single genes did not take sufficiently small values to show statistically significant difference among them. mRNA measurements from more animals could lead to lower p-values, smaller gene clusters and more statistically significant gene rankings. the angular correlation coefficients obtained this way do not necessarily match the pairwise correlation coefficients calculated using mRNA measurements in the dataset. for each pair of genes, we calculated the standard deviation of the 12 correlation coefficients, resulting in 88 values for each gene. the judges have the lowest degree of consensus about the correlation of IL11 with other genes. high resolution images of the panels of Fig 8 are shown in S15 Information. for each of the loading plots obtained from the 12 judges, we construct a matrix of correlation coefficients. for each pair of genes, we calculated the standard deviation of the 12 correlation coefficients, resulting in 88 values for each gene. smaller values suggest higher degrees of agreement between judges on the correlation of a gene with other genes. the distance from the origin indicates the overall contribution of the genes in the dataset, obtained from Fig 5 and the figure in S4 Information. radial grid lines define the clusters obtained in Fig 7 each of which contains genes that are significantly more contributing than the genes in the lower neighboring cluster. the radial grid lines define the cluster of genes that consist of significantly more (less) contributing genes than their lower (upper) neighboring clusters. the genes are color-coded to match the gene clusters shown on the left hand side of each panel in Fig 8. top contributing genes have approximately equal contributions to all tissues. if a PC is multiplied by -1, the new vector is still a principal component. however, all the relative positions of genes change in the loading plot. classification rates in PBMCs are 87.5% and 83.3%, greater than or equal to the classification rates in spleen and MLN. each tissue has unique expression profiles, e.g. XCL1, a relatively high-contributing gene, contributes highly to spleen and MLN compared to PBMC. the inner color of each gene shows its overall rank in all tissues. hypercytokinemia is known as \"cytokine storm\" and it is not unique to HIV. other pathogens may also cause strong immune responses. inflammatory response is not fatal but may cause irreparable impairment to the immune system. the nanostring panel in this study was designed to understand how immune responses are longitudinally developed in different organs or cells during acute SIV infection. the panel includes genes that are commonly analyzed during inflammation and viral infection, and has been used to evaluate the longitudinal level variances in individual cytokines during SIV infection. this can be due to several reasons including lack of prior information on how changes in gene expressions affect the immune response. each of the twelve judges provides a distinct set of uncorrelated principal components (PCs), capturing the directions in the data with maximum variance. from each set, we select two PCs that provide the most accurate and robust classification of the data in each of the classification schemes. judges to sort genes based on their overall rank for each gene. this suggests that the gene is accurately ranked, regardless of how changes in gene expressions affect the immune response. this suggests that the specific way that gene expression changes are translated to the immune response matters, and that these genes can hold less or more significance. similar high ranking genes in spleen, MLN and PBMC reveal a systemic and concomitant type I interferon response during acute SIV infection. similar high ranking genes in spleen, MLN and PBMC reveal a systemic and concomitant type I interferon response during acute SIV infection. however, ranking gives somewhat limited information on how genes relate to each other and how transcription is longitudinally modulated in each tissue. this powerful visualization tool can be used to identify genes that uniquely contribute to immune responses in specific tissues. the model suggests that evaluation of a small selected panel of ISGs and chemokines in PBMCs may be sufficient to assess systemic inflammatory responses triggered by viral infection in secondary lymphoid tissues. twenty-four juvenile pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) were studied before and during acute SIV infection. groups of six infected macaques were euthanized at 4, 7 and 14 days post infection. four animals were mock-inoculated and used as uninfected controls. ques were fed a balanced commercial macaque chow (Purina Mills) all macaques were perfused with sterile saline solution before euthanasia. blood was collected for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. codeSets for 92 macaque genes (S1 Table) were designed according to the company's specifications, based on rhesus macaques annotated sequences. the kit also includes six positive probes for quality control and seven negative controls whose sequences were obtained from the External RNA Controls Consortium. mRNA counts were normalized by the geometric mean of four housekeeping genes. this function returns PCs (loadings), the amount of variability captured by each PC, and scores for both input and output variables. we use the plsregress function in Matlab to perform PLS regression. each dataset was analyzed by all 12 judges, forming a multivariate analysis algorithm. observations are classified into clusters using shortest distance between observation and centroid. the true class information for each observation is known prior to the analysis, and if the cluster is assigned correctly, the classification is successful; otherwise it has failed. group of six infected macaques were euthanized at 4, 7 and 14 days post infection. four animals were mock-inoculated and used as uninfected controls. the 4-day time point is included as the earliest time point that the virus could be found in the brain of infected macaques. RNA isolation from spleen, MLN, and PBMC Total RNA was isolated from frozen spleen, MLN, and PBMCs using a percoll protocol. samples were eluted in 60 L of RNase-free water and frozen at -80\u00b0C until time to be analysed. mRNA counts were normalized by the geometric mean of four housekeeping genes. we used mRNA measurements from 88 genes as input variables in our analysis. gene expression datasets are first preprocessed using a transformation and a normalization method. in this work, we use the plsregress function in Matlab to perform PLS regression. this function returns PCs (loadings), the amount of variability captured by each PC, and scores for both input and output variables. the columns of the score matrix returned by the plsregress function are orthonormal. a single observation from the dataset is selected as the test dataset. the remaining observations are used as the training dataset to build the model and to calculate the centroid for each cluster. the test observation is projected onto the low-dimensional space created by the model and assigned to the nearest cluster.
