{"summary": "between 1949 and 1978, the Chinese health care system was designed to provide equal access for all regardless of ability to pay. the post-1978 economic reforms and the market-oriented approach have helped develop the Chinese health care system. the number of hospitals in China has increased from 9902 to 20 918 between 1980 and 2010. some scholars have commented that these financial incentives even may have directly eroded physicians\u2019 ethics. the rise of china\u2019s promarket health care delivery system between 1978 and 2002 had sown the seed for a major public health breakout, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2003 in china. the government listed several aspects of public hospital reform as one of the most important tasks. the government listed several aspects of public hospital reform as one of the most important tasks. the dominating role of tertiary-level public hospitals, public hospitals\u2019 profit-driven behaviors and the lack of a comprehensive physician professionalism system. in 2012, the bed occupancy rate was 94.2% for public hospitals, 104.5% for tertiary-level public hospitals, as against 63.2% for private hospitals. public hospitals accounted for 88.15% of the inpatient surgeries as of 2012.4 Public hospitals also are the employers of most high-quality practitioners. promoting private hospitals owned by domestic social capital and foreign investors has become one of the major barriers to the success of these reform measures. the policy of promoting private hospitals has faced a number of barriers due to current physician-agency relationships. the emerging private hospitals owned by social enterprise or investors are more likely to be for-profit. strengthening physicians\u2019 professionalism will be even more important in an environment where physicians are practicing at explicitly for-profit facilities. the multilocation practice policy sought to break the domination of physician resources by tertiary-level public hospitals. tertiary-level public hospitals become a natural barrier to the development of multilocation practices. the implementation of physician multilocation practice policy may itself create new problems, including health service quality and increased patient risk. government regulations on physicians\u2019 groups or physicians practicing in other health care facilities are still vague and insufficient. a study on a well-recognized reform model, \u201cSanming,\u201d26,43 also showed the zero mark-up drug policy\u2019s effect on reducing expenditure faded over the long term. lack of a proper professional code for Chinese physicians could make physicians\u2019 and hospitals\u2019 fee response behaviors even more extensive. policy of promoting private hospitals has faced a number of barriers due to current physician-agency relationships. senior physicians prefer to remain at tertiary-level public hospitals for professional as well as financial reasons. emerging private hospitals owned by social enterprise or investors are more likely to be for-profit, and such profit-driven nature will make the physicians practicing at their facilities profit-making agents. multilocation practice policy seeks to break domination of physician resources by tertiary-level public hospitals. however, critical barriers still exist, and the establishment of multilocation practice will itself create new challenges. tertiary-level public hospitals become a natural barrier to the development of multilocation practices. from 2015, the Chinese government began to eliminate the 15% drug cost markup for public hospitals (eg, zero mark-up drug policy) by September 30, 2017, all public hospitals should have eliminated the drug markup (except for Traditional Chinese Medicine) the comprehensive payment structure reform required that, on average, the increased fee schedule will compensate 90% of the drug mark-up profit loss for county-level hospitals and above. the eventual goal of current Chinese health care reforms is to create a market with providers of numerous ownership, including public and for-profit private hospitals. a systematically well-developed physician professionalism system will also be necessary to achieve this long-term goal with sustainable physician-patient and physician-hospital agency relations. an existing tool the Chinese government may consider is the US Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS),45. a comprehensive physician professionalism system will also be necessary to serve as the foundation for a long-term solution for the recently introduced provider-related health care reforms. a comprehensive physician professionalism system will also be necessary to serve as the foundation for a long-term solution for the recently introduced provider-related health care reforms. the development of a comprehensive physician professionalism system should be implemented at macro, meso, and micro levels. the Chinese government should design a high-level legal framework and regulation to prohibit hospitals using measures related to volume or contribution of profit to incentivize physicians. the US Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute provide examples of how Western legal systems keep the autonomy and professionalism of practitioners separate from health care facilities. health care facility Create culture within health care facility align with physician professionalism framework Create a strong \u201cpatient come first\u201d culture and align physicians\u2019 individual professionalism with organizational culture. professionalism as one of the 6 core competencies of the graduate medical education set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) a physician governance body should design, monitor and evaluate physicians\u2019 professional behavior as part of the physicians\u2019 key performance review. health care facilities should seek to create a clear culture to support physician professionalism and align their internal culture with an overall physician professionalism framework. china has implemented policies to reduce overprescribing behaviors. but more needs to be done to align physicians\u2019 incentives with the patient population. an existing tool the Chinese government may consider is the US Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS),45. the development of a comprehensive physician professionalism system should be implemented at macro, meso, and micro levels. a comprehensive physician professionalism system should be implemented at macro, meso, and micro levels, a multipronged approach. the Chinese government should design a high-level legal framework to prohibit hospitals using measures related to volume or contribution of profit to incentivize physicians. the US Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute provide examples of how Western legal systems keep the autonomy and professionalism of practitioners separate from health care facilities. a professional physician association, for example, should assume a larger role in developing, monitoring, and supervising high-level physicians\u2019 professional values and behaviors. meso physician governance body Define professionalism as a core physician competency comprising a set of behaviors. set up goals and evaluate physician performance factors. performance factors, eg, accountability, flexibility, innovation, partnership, diversity, integrity and quality, service, and results, are included in the clearer code of conduct. the establishment of physician personal professionalism requires a combination of medical school and graduate medical education,56,57 self and peer assessment,58 role model of attending physicians,59 and specific values and behaviors to interact with patients, health care team, and health care facilities. the current most important barrier for the public hospital reform is the lack of competition caused by the existing financial relations between public hospitals and senior physicians. the government has tried to leverage private hospital investment, use policy to promote physicians\u2019 mobility, and change reimbursement policy, to overcome these barriers. a well-designed physician professionalism system can serve as the foundation for a long-term solution that can promote provider-related reform activities. the Chinese health system has gone through its own developmental phases and is facing unique challenges. a study on the impact of reimbursement method change from fee-for-service to per-diem for a public psychiatric hospital illustrated that the payment policy had not achieved its anticipated goals because physicians\u2019 behaviors were still tied to the original financial incentives the hospital had designed. a major barrier to achieving the government\u2019s prospective goals for its health care delivery reform in China is the lack of an appropriate physician-agency relationship."}
