{"summary": "aberrant glycosylation of membrane components due to specific alterations of glycosylation activity is a common feature of carcinoma cells. gastric cancer is the fourth most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world. the expression level of 4GnT mRNA is increased in association with tumor progression. ppGalNAc-T2 is a member of the ppGalNAc-T family which catalyzes the attachment of the first N-acetylgal actosaminyltransferase 2 (ppGalNAc-T2) to the polypeptide at the initiation of O-linked glycosylation of proteins. ppGalNac-T2 expression appears to be higher in gastric cancer SGC7901 cells than in other poorly differentiated human cancer cells. however, a comprehensive understanding of how ppGalNAc-T2 correlates with the invasive potential of human gastric cancer is not currently available. ppGalNAc-T2 gene is useful in regulating gastric carcinoma invasion and metastasis. pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors and pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors were transfected with pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors. pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 antisense vectors (SGC7901-T2as group), followed by selection with G418 (500 g/ml) individual clones were isolated and expanded for further characterization. cell proliferation assay Cell proliferation was measured with MTT assay. washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. then 0.5 ml suspension of tumor cells (5x103) were added. 96-well plates were precoated with either 1 mg/ml hyaluronic acid (HA) or 50 1 g/ml FN. -polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Total-RNA was isolated from equal cell numbers using Tri Reagent (Sigma) the number of PCR cycles used was 30 and the expected product size after primer amplification was as follows. western blot analysis To detect ppGalNAc-T2, MMP-2, MMP-14 and TGF-1 protein expression in gastric cancer cells after indicated treatment, cells were harvested and extracted using the standard methods. equal amounts of protein (50 g) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors and pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 antisense vectors. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24, 48, 72, 96 or 120 h. l50 l DMSO (Sigma) and the absorbance of samples at 570 nm were then measured. a growth curve was plotted as the log cell number vs. time. a flat-bottomed 96-well plate was coated overnight at 4\u00b0C. some wells were left uncoated as negative control. the cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 12\u201324 h. cells (1x105) were seeded in each transwell insert containing 200 l of serum-free medium with BSA. then 500 l of culture medium with 10% FBS was added into each well of a 24-well plate. the number of PCR cycles used was 30. ppGalNAc-T2, 669 bp; MMP-2, 332 bp; MMP-14, 690 bp; and -actin, 330 bp. rabbit second antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) Statistical analysis The results shown are the mean SD. A P-value 0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant differences. expression of ppGalNAc-T2 mRNA detected by RT-PCR. intensity of PCR product normalized against -actin. 1, SHG44 cells; 2, SGC7901 cells; 3, SHI-1 cells; 4, A549 cells; and 5, HO8910 cells. ppGalNAc-T2 expression in different clones of stably transfected cells was analysed by western blot analysis. ppGalNAc-T2 expression in different clones of stably transfected cells. untreated SGC7901 cells, stably overexpressing ppGalNAc-T2. the ability of cell proliferation in the SGC7901-T2s cells was decreased compared with the control or untreated cells. treatment of SGC7901 cells with ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors was associated with a time-dependent inhibition of cell growth. the cells (5x103) were added to a 96-well plate coated with HA, FN or Matrigel. the cells were incubated at 0.5, 1 and 1.5 h intervals. overexpression of ppGalNAc-T2 inhibits cell adhesion. ppGalNAc-T2 expression is associated with the adhesion of cells in vitro. overexpression of ppGalNAc-T2 has a significant anti-adhesion effect at all intervals. ppGalNAc-T2 expression was inversely associated with the invasiveness of cells in vitro. ppGalNAc-T2 is a key enzyme since it is responsible for degradation of the ECM. ppGalNAc-T2 activity can be activated by MMP-14. this activity may be involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. expression of MMP-2 at the mRNA level was lower in the SGC7901-T2s group. expression of MMP-2 at the protein level was increased in ppGalNAc-T2-downregulation cells, but decreased in the ppGalNAc-T2-overexpressing cells. ppGalNAc-T2 might regulate MMP-2 but not MMP-14 expressions at the transcriptional level. expression panel of ppGalNAc-T2 was detected in 5 malignant tumor cells. mRNA level of ppGalNAc-T2 was determined by RT-PCR. all poorly differentiated tumor cells expressed ppGalNAc-T2 mRNA. ppGalNAc-T2 mRNA and protein levels in the SGC7901 cells were measured by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. ppGalNAc-T2 transcripts were increased in the pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vector transfected cells (P0.05) ppGalNAc-T2 mRNA and protein expression was suppressed in the SGC7901-T2as group when compared to expression levels of ppGalNAc-T2 in different clones of stably transfected cells. ppGalNAc-T2 expression in different SGC7901 cells was analysed. ppGalNAc-T2 expression in different SGC7901 cells was analysed. treatment of SGC7901 cells with ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors was associated with a time-dependent inhibition of cell growth. no significant inhibitory effect was observed in the untreated and control cells. the cells (5x103) were added to a 96-well plate coated with HA, FN or Matrigel. overexpression of ppGalNAc-T2 inhibits cell adhesion. values are expressed as the mean SD of three independent experiments. different invasiveness was observed in the control, untreated, as well as the SGC7901-T2s and SGC7901-T2as group cells. the control group cells showed little invasion in comparison to the untreated cells. overexpression of ppGalNAc-T2 in SGC7901-T2s cells decreased their migratory capacity (P0.05) expression of ppGalNAc-T2 at the mRNA level was lower in the SGC7901-T2s group than in the SGC7901-T2as group. there was no difference between untreated and control group cells (P>0.05) however, there was no evident change on the mRNA transcriptional expression of MMP-14. the expression of MMP-2 at the protein level was increased in the ppGalNAc-T2-downregulation cells, but decreased in the ppGalNAc-T2-overexpressing cells (P0.05). similar to the RT-PCR results, the expression of the MMP-14 protein presented no noticeable difference in all groups (P>0.05). syltransferases involved in synthesis of glycans are catalyzed by a family of glycosyltransferases called the UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases. these structural changes can alter the function of the cell, and its antigenic and adhesive properties, as well as its potential to invade and metastasize. tumor metastasis occurs by a series of steps including cell attachment, invasion, and proliferation. ppGalNAc-T2 expression levels in gastric cancer are associated with a high risk of metastasis. pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors were transfected into SGC7901 cells. the ppGalNAc-T2 antisense vectors transfected cells attached better to FN and HA than any other cell line. upregulated expression of ppGalNAc-T2 is likely to inhibit the growth of the cancer cells in the metastatic sites due to a decrease in cell adhesive ability. the multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) plays a dual role in the process of carcinogenesis by promoting tumor progression by enhancing migration, invasion and survival of tumor cells. we also investigated the effect of ppGalNAc-T2 on the expression of TGF-1 in SGC7901 cells."}
