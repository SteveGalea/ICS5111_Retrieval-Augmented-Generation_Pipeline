{"summary": "neonatal diarrhoea is a frequent clinical condition in commercial swine herds. neonatal diarrhoea is unresponsive to antibiotics and common management practices. neonatal diarrhoea is a frequent clinical condition in commercial swine herds. a new neonatal porcine diarrhoea was present in the investigated herds. no known pathogens or management factors could explain the diarrhoeal outbreaks. systematic investigations of piglets from affected herds are lacking. the aim of this study was to investigate whether a detailed microbiological examination of a larger number of piglets could link the presence of neonatal diarrhoea with known enteric pathogens. microbiological findings in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets. none of the microbiological agents was significantly more prevalent in diarrhoeic than in non-diarrhoeic piglets. fimbrial genes were detected in nine of 35 isolates from diarrhoeic piglets. fimbrial distribution among isolates was; F4 (n=2), F5 (n=1), F6 (n=1), F18 (n=2), F5/F6 (n=1) and F5/F41 (n=1). in the anaerobic culture, CPA was a very frequent finding. these bacteria were more prevalent in non-diarrhoeic than in diarrhoeic piglets (70% vs. 35%). a pale or icteric liver was observed in more than one piglet. a poor body condition, flaccidity of the small intestine, flaccidity of the large intestine and liquid large intestinal contents seemed positively associated with diarrhoea. the large intestine was in most cases (25 of 27 cases) seen in conjunction with small intestinal flaccidity. the small intestine is thin-walled and flaccid throughout its length. the intestine appears to lack its normal peristaltic capacity. the small intestinal wall has a normal thickness. moderate local infiltration of neutrophils in the lamina propria. mild epithelial lesions were seen at the tip of the villi in 20% of the diarrhoeic and 6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets. mucosal necrosis in the colon was seen in one diarrhoeic piglet.

Necropsy findings are presented in Table 3. six findings showed a statistically significant higher prevalence in diarrhoeic versus non-diarrhoeic piglets. a poor body condition, flaccidity of the small intestine, flaccidity of the large intestine and liquid large intestinal contents seemed positively associated with diarrhoea. the small intestine is thin-walled and flaccid throughout its length. the intestine appears to lack its normal peristaltic capacity, since no sections are contracted. approximately 30% of piglets had a slight to moderate local infiltration of neutrophils in the lamina propria. mild epithelial lesions were seen at the tip of the villi in 20% of the diarrhoeic and 6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets. findings in 51 diarrhoeic (D) and 50 non-diarrhoeic (ND)

commonly associated with malabsorption caused by starvation. 80% of piglets in this study were diarrhoeic for two or three days. however, we do not have information on the contents of stomachs at later stages of disease. the most consistent and predominant histological lesion observed in diarrhoeic piglets was villous atrophy (seen in 63% of diarrhoeic vs. 12% of non-diarrhoeal piglets) the atrophy was neither associated with infection by well-known pathogens nor malnutrition. the unspecific nature of intestinal lesions seen in this study underlines the complexity of intestinal pathology in neonatal pigs. the existence of neonatal diarrhoa with unspecific lesions and without known pathogens is not a new phenomenon. coli, Clostridium perfringens type A or C, Clostridium difficile, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia spp, Cystoisospora suis or Strongyloides ransomi. villous atrophy in jejunum and ileum are the most prominent findings and epithelial lesions in colon seem to be associated with the syndrome. all four herds had been affected by neonatal diarrhoea for at least one year. preventive interventions included minimizing protein-levels in sow feed, optimization of hygiene procedures, immunization by faecal backfeeding and vaccination against CPA and Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). in each herd, approximately 20 newly farrowed sows with no clinical signs of disease prior to farrowing were selected. piglets were clinically examined daily from day 1 until day five to seven and again on day ten. diarrhoeic piglets were selected from the litters with the highest prevalence of diarrhoea. non-diarrhoeic piglets were selected from the litters exhibiting no or little diarrhoea. none of the piglets euthanized at the early stage had been medicated according to the individual herd routine. the presence of parasites (Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia spp, Cystoisospora suis and Strongyloides ransomi) was examined using standard diagnostic criteria. piglets were considered positive if any growth of haemolytic colonies or moderate/ massive growth of non-haemolytic colonies was seen in any section of intestine. no agglutination with antisera was seen, the isolate was designated non-typeable. colonies were verified using tryptose-Sulfite-Cycloserine agar. piglets were considered culture positive if moderate/ massive growth was observed in any section of intestine. a case\u2013control study on 101 euthanized piglets selected from four production herds was performed during 2011. a total of 989 piglets from these herds were clinically evaluated from the day of birth and 110 were euthanized at selected time points. descriptive data of the 4 herds in the study Herd data Herd 1 Herd 2 Herd 3 Herd 4 Study period January 2011

piglets were necropsied at day three and five of life. piglets were necropsied between three and seven days of age. all organs were routinely examined for gross lesions. a poor body condition was recorded if protruding ribs and spine were observed. samples were fixed immediately after euthanasia in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 48 hours. piglets were considered culture positive if moderate/ massive growth was observed in any section of intestine. agglutination with monovalent O-antisera (O8, O45, O64, O138, O139, O141, O149 and O157, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark) was performed. virology Contents of jejunum were examined for rotavirus group A by an enzyme immunoassay (ProSpectT\u00ae Rotavirus) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and for coronavirus by a pan-corona RT-PCR assay. associations between diarrhoea and microbiological and pathological findings were evaluated using one-sided Fisher\u2019s exact tests. ruptions in the epithelium and lamina propria were recorded as mild epithelial lesions. presence of parasites (Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia spp, Cystoisospora suis and Strongyloides ransomi) was examined using standard diagnostic
