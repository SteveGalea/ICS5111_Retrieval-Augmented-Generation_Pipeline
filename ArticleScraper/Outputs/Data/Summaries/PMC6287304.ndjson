{"summary": "Xanthosine monophosphate (XMP, 1, Figure 1) is an important intermediate in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. XMP is formed either from inosine monophosphate (IMP) by IMPDH or via salvage pathway using hypoxanthine or xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase. dXMP and dGTP are catabolic products of dGMP and dGTP enzymatic hydrolysis. these processes can lead to substantial incorporation of xanthine nucleotides into DNA and/or RNA,8 and subsequently to RNA miscoding and mutagenesis. deaminated nucleotides can interfere with RNA editing12 and with functions of noncoding RNAs. acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (ANP) cidofovir (CDV),19 or diphosphate mimic foscarnet,20 many drug insensitive viruses have been identified in the clinic. the origin of virus resistance comes mostly from treatment using DNA polymerase inhibitors, such as ACV and GCV. xanthine-based ANPs exploited by MW-assisted hydrolysis of corresponding 2,6-dichloropurine derivatives. synthesis of 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]xanthine (PMEX, 4, Scheme 1) has been reported by our group earlier. compound 17 (Scheme 3) was prepared in a 75% yield from the corresponding N6-cyclopropyl-2,6-diaminopurine derivative 16,35 using the above mentioned diazotization/2-hydroxy-dediazoniation procedure. compound 17 was expected to be enzymatically converted (deaminated) to PMEX. morpholine, DCC, t-BuOH, H2O, 105 \u00b0C, 16 h; pyrophosphate (0.5 M in DMF), DMSO, 25 \u00b0C. morpholine, DCC, t-BuOH, t-BuOH, 105 \u00b0C, 16 h; pyrophosphate (0.5 M in DMF), DMSO.
