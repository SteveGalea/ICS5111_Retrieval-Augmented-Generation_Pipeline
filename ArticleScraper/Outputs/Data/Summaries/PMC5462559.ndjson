{"summary": "the term has gained traction in the study of malaria. it has been used to describe groups of small areas (often less than 12 km2) with elevated incidence,23,24 similarly sized units of elevated transmission intensity,2,25 larger spatial units of elevated incidence,26 and even countries with a high burden of disease. cholera generally transmits with higher efficiency in Bangladesh than in Zimbabwe. if one looked only at overall incidence of cholera between those two countries in 2008\u20132009, one might be led to erroneously conclude that Zimbabwe was more of a cholera hotspot due to the large epidemic. hotspots of disease emergence are typically designated on broader spatial scales than those of elevated prevalence or transmission. the goal has not necessarily been to identify highly localized disease emergence hotspots. some groups of homesteads in rural Kenya remain malaria transmission hotspots for years. hotspot is an evocative term that is often used in a casual and imprecise manner to spark interest in a paper or topic. the term has found increased use in policy and practice documents,6\u20138,45 guiding decisions on resource allocation and disease-control strategies. some documents use the term with little clarification. 40\u201344 Emergence hotspot An area of elevated disease incidence or prevalence or a geographic cluster of cases 23,24,26,28 Burden hotspot, high burden country/province/and so on, hyperendemic region, case cluster Spatial heterogeneity in disease processes is a growing field of study."}
