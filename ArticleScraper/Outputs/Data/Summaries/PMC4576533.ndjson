{"summary": "majority of exacerbations are infectious and bacteria responsible for 30-50% of these cases. the purpose of this study was to determine the bacteriology of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is common in adults over 50 years of age due to smoking habits and high indoor pollution. acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is defined as a sustained worsening of the patient\u2019s condition, from the stable state and beyond normal day-to-day variations. prevalence of AECOPD varies from 1% in urban non-smoker to 21% in rural smokers. mortality rate increased to 30% if the patient was above diagnosis and knowledge of local bacteriological profile & antibiogram help us to reduce the number of failure cases recorded with empirical treatment during AECOPD. the present work was done to find out the aerobic bacteria and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern in AECOPD as very little reports are available from India. patients admitted in emergency department, attending out patient department, sign & symptoms suggestive of coronary thrombosis, localized suppurative infection in the lung, allergic origin pulmonary disease and antibiotics before hospitalisation were not included in the study. none of the patients had received immunization for Haemophilus influenae or Streptococcus pneumoniae in the past. growth of pathogenic organisms was obtained in 41.12% (44/107) cases. Klebsiella pneumoniae with Streptococcus pneumoniae in each case. purulent or mucopurulent sputum gave better isolation than mucoid or mucosalivary sputum. 44.44% (4/9) of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant.
