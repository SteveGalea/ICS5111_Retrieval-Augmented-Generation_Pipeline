{"summary": "microRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in gene regulators in many biological and molecular phenomena. unraveling the involvement of miRNA as a key cellular factor during in vitro canine parvovirus (CPV) infection may facilitate the discovery of potential intervention candidates. CPV is a common cause of viral enteritis in puppies with high morbidity and mortality. CPV is a single-stranded DNA virus in the Parvoviridae family. CPV-2 can cause severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis in dogs. miRNAs play a pivotal role in many biological and molecular phenomena. some miRNAs are involved in the regulation of genes related to the specific process in mammalian cells. miRNAs are known to behave as an oncogene or tumor suppressor genes. however, the change of miRNA expression profiles in CPV has not been fully elucidated. a few researchers have studied the miRNA repertoire using domestic cats. rectal swab samples from dogs were kept frozen for further analysis of CPV by PCR/real-time PCR. swabs soaked with sterile phosphate-buffered saline were used. confluent CRFK monolayer cells (80%) in 25 cm2 flasks were infected with supernatant. after adsorbed for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, the inoculum was removed. DMEM with 5% FBS was added then the cells were again incubated at 37 \u00b0C. RNA isolation, library preparation and sequencing RNA isolation Total RNA of CRFK infected with CPV-2c Laotian stains (CPV) or control was isolated using RNAzol\u00ae RT reagent (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and Direct-zolTM RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) microRNA expression analyses Quality control and reads mapping to reference sequence Raw reads of fastq format were processed and filtered through perl and python scripts. the downstream analyses were based mainly on the clean and high-quality reads. miRDeep2 (Friedl\u00e4nder et al., 2011) was served as a tool for searching for known miRNA. miRNA editing analysis The seed region, position 2\u20138 of a mature miRNA, was identified by aligning all sRNA tags to mature miRNA. only one nucleotide mismatch at the seed region was permitted. target gene prediction was executed by using miRanda. gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed miRNA genes were implemented by the iDEP.90 web-based analysis software. GO terms with corrected p-value less than 0.05 were considered significantly enriched by differential expressed genes. Statistical analysis of miRNA-seq experiments Statistical analyses were performed using the R software version 3.5.1/R studio version 1.1.456. graphic illustrations were also generated by VennDiagram, calibrate, datasets, ggplot2, viridis R packages. Differential expression analysis was carried out using DESeq2. cell cultures were observed daily during 3\u20135 days to monitor the appearance of cytopathic effects (CPE) cell cultures were observed daily during 3\u20135 days to monitor the appearance of cytopathic effects (CPE) the infected CRFKs were subjected to three rounds of freezing and thawing cycles. the supernatants were collected; tested for genomic DNA of CPV. the cryotubes were spun at 8,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. RNA were eluted with DNase/RNase-free water. RNA purity was verified using the nanoPhotometer\u00ae spectrophotometer. RNA integrity and quantitation were evaluated with RNA Nano 6000 kit. the total RNA were eluted with DNase/RNase-free water. RNA purity was verified using the nanoPhotometer\u00ae spectrophotometer. the 1% agarose gels were run to check the RNA degradation/contamination. reads was mapped to reference genome (Mus musculus mm10) by Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) miRDeep2 was used as a tool for searching for known miRNA. miRNA counts and base bias on the first position of miRNA were obtained using custom scripts in perl. target gene prediction The miRNA target gene prediction was executed by using miRanda (Enright et al., 2003) raw reads of fastq format were processed and filtered through perl and python scripts. the downstream analyses were based mainly on the clean and high-quality reads. miRNA editing analysis The seed region, position 2\u20138 of a mature miRNA, was identified by aligning all sRNA tags to mature miRNA. only one nucleotide mismatch at the seed region was permitted. gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed miRNA genes were implemented by the iDEP.90 web-based analysis software. GO terms with corrected p-value less than 0.05 were considered significantly enriched by differential expressed genes. a total of raw reads ranged from 23,466,804 to 26,337,331 reads were obtained. 98.66% and 98.08% raw reads of high quality for the Control. 97.63% and 98.48% libraries for CPV groups were defined as clean reads. nt long sequences with high frequency are routinely considered the length of miRNAs in animals. the frequency of Control sRNA libraries was 28.33% and 20.85% (22 nt), while the CPV sRNA libraries were 25.91% (23 nt) and 30.29% (22 nt) the percentage of sRNAs of 24 nt was significantly higher than that of other sRNAs. bases from position 2 to 4 on the 5\u2032 end are usually resistant to U. bases from position 10 have a strong A preference. the majority of the first base from the 5\u2032 end of mature miRNAs had U. 420 miRNAs corresponded to 177 diversified miRNA families. 11 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the CPV vs. control libraries. the majority of known miRNAs had 22\u201323 nt in both of the libraries. in RNA-seq, replicates have two main advantages: first, they demonstrate whether the experiment is repeatable, and secondly, they can reveal differences in gene expression between samples. heatmap of gene expression (Z-score) in each control sample (Control) and CPV-infected sample (CPV) colors indicate the up- (red) and down-regulation (green) of gene expression. four categorized groups were determined by the representation of heatmap based mainly on Z-score. miRNA expression and differential expression The input data was the read count value of the miRNA expression level analysis. each miRNA read count from Control and CPV group was compared by the transcripts per million (TPM) significant changes of genes (>1 or 1 log2 fold change) from DESeq2 are color highlighted. red represents upregulation and blue are downregulated genes. gray points are no change in gene expression. -5p, miR-361-3p, Novel 102, Novel 137, Novel 141 were downregulated miRNAs. of the 75 novel miRNAs that passed the filtering process, no up-regulated miRNAs were found at the FDR 0.05. differentially expressed novel miRNAs demonstrated 2-fold or greater expression changes between the Control and CPV groups. the volcano plot, the MA, and scatter plot show that CPV infection lead to a considerably minimal miRNA transcriptomic response. a total of 5,828 target genes in F. catus genome was found in all 515 known and novel miRNAs identified in this study. the number of target genes for each differentially expressed miRNA ranged from a few hundred to nearly a thousand. the highest number of target genes was predicted for miR-322-5p (972 genes), followed by miR-361-3p (965 genes) of which, both miRNAs were down-regulated in CPV infected cells. d diagram shows enriched biological processes (by colors) linking each gene cluster to the corresponding processes. d diagram shows enriched biological

played a pivotal role in the defense response to external stimuli. a gene network was constructed by utilizing lists of genes involved in multiple biological processes. 26 genes in the network were clustered into three groups. two genes (BAX and SOCS5) were excluded from the network. 63% and 98.48% libraries for CPV groups were defined as clean reads. the frequency of control sRNA libraries was 28.33% and 20.85% (22 nt), while the CPV sRNA libraries were 25.91% (23 nt) the percentage of sRNAs of 24 nt was significantly higher than that of other sRNAs. miRNA is produced by Dicer from pri-miRNA. the first base from the 5\u2032 end has a strong preference of U. bases from position 2 to 4 on the 5\u2032 end are usually resistant to U. 333 known hairpin structures corresponded to 420 unique mature miRNA sequences. those miRNAs were conserved among animals and plant species. 11 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the CPV vs. Control libraries. miRNA family analysis We have also explored the occurrence of known miRNA and novel miRNA families identified from the sample in human, other animal species, worm, fly, fish, amphibian and plant. differentially expressed known and novel miRNAs between control and CPV infection sRNA-seq correlation and characteristics of sRNA-seq data. the dimensionality reduction technique (t-SNE) of small RNA-seq data was arranged in two clusters (A and B) based on the similarity of their gene expression profiles. colors indicate the up- (red) and down-regulation (green) of gene expression. the t-SNE visualization of Control/CPV showed limited overlap between two miRNA libraries. in control and CPV-infected cells could be customarily segmented into visibly two patterns of detection, up- and down-regulated of miRNA genes. four categorized groups were determined by the representation of heatmap based mainly on Z-score; namely from high (red) to low (green) or base-line expression (black or mixed colored), respectively. the overlap (n = 430) represents the genes expressed in common between samples. colors indicate the up- (red) and down-regulation (light blue) of gene expression. gray points are no change in gene expression. miR-17A-5p, miR-147-3p, miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-1247-3p, Novel 4 were upregulated miRNAs in CVP over Control libraries. no up-regulated novel miRNAs were found at the FDR 0.05. differentially expressed novel miRNAs demonstrated 2-fold or greater expression changes (log2 fold change; 1 or 1) between the Control and CPV groups. the Volcano plot of gene expression in CPV-infected cells showed fold change (vertical dotted lines) in gene expression regulated genes (FC 2 (red) or 2 (green), FDR 0.05) are highlighted. the volcano plot, the MA, and scatter plot show that CPV infection lead to a considerably minimal miRNA transcriptomic response. the closer the correlation coefficient is to 1, the greater the similarity of the samples. ENCODE suggests that the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient should be larger than 0.92. the correlation coefficient within group and between groups were larger than 0.92. 77.6% of the variance was retrieved from sRNA-seq. the mixed gene expression pattern in exploratory miRNA species heterogeneity was retrieved from sRNA-seq. each miRNA read count from Control and CPV group was compared by the transcripts per million (TPM) reads are shown in red if they are significant upregulated, or blue when significant downregulated. the number of expressed miRNAs differed between the CPV and Control. regulation was found (FDR 0.05 and fold-change > 2). of the 75 novel miRNAs that passed the filtering process, no up-regulated novel miRNAs were found at the FDR 0.05. CPV groups were 22 (up-regulated) and 13 down-regulated novel miRNAs. a threshold of FDR 0.1 and fold-change > 2. The mean average (MA) plot is a plot for visual representation of genomic data. CPV induced miR-222-5p, miR-1247-3p and miR-365-2-5p. whereas suppressed miR-361-3p, miR-322-5p, novel 102, 141 and 137. a total of 5,828 target genes in F. catus genome was found in all 515 known and novel miRNAs identified in this study. diagram shows significant miRNAs identified in CPV-infected libraries. only miRNA-1247 is highlighted in the diagram. of eight miRNA DEGs, we did test all up- and down-regulated miRNAs. we found that miRNA-1247-3p modulated at least 28 genes. miRNA-1247-3p modulated at least 28 genes. GO categories were assigned for target genes of miR-1247-3p. 229 putative targets were identified in the total of 38 enriched GO categories. top ten over-represented GO terms (enrichment) were 'lymphocyte activation involved in immune response' the target genes were classified into five groups, of which they are mostly involved in \u201canion binding\u201d, \u201cprotein binding\u201d and \u201corganic cyclic compound binding\u201d. the most over-represented GO term (50.12-fold enrichment) was \u201cmarginal B cell zone differentiation\u201d involving three genes. a total of 28 genes were found to be highly diversified in multiple GO terms. the 26 genes in the network were clustered into three groups. two genes (BAX and SOCS5) were excluded from the network. RNA-seq has revolutionized and become a widely used approach to study quantitative aspects of transcriptome profiling in the virus-infected cells. in the current study, we have identified 515 DEGs using sRNA libraries in either uninfected control or CPV-infection. we have identified 196 known mammalian miRNAs in their report. iR-29b, miR-125b and miR-320a pinpointed about three miRNAs that significantly up-regulated in CPV infection (miR-222-5p, miR-1247-3p and miR-365-5p) many more miRNAs were significantly down-regulated (miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p) in immunological response to virus, miR-1247-3p had roughly 229 target genes. the function can be categorized into 33 GO by GO enrichment analysis (GO biological process term) the miRNA-1247-3p function is estimated to modulate at least 200 genes, involving in 38 GO biological processes. the miRNA-1247-3p and its cognate target genes in biological pathways highlight their great potential as novel therapeutic targets or diagnostic biomarkers of CPV infection. this work has highlighted the importance of some potential miRNAs and their target functional, relevant genes in controlling and mitigating immunity to CPV virus. list of miRNA family identified in the current study. click here for additional data file. list of significant differently expressed miRNAs. the node size depicts the significant enrichment. functionally related groups are emphasized by overlapping of colors. click here for additional data file. prediction of target genes of known and novel miRNAs (significant differently expressed miRNAs) in the current study. click here for additional data file.
