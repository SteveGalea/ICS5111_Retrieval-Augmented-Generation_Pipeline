{"summary": "type I IFNs comprise multiple IFN subtypes (11 in mice and 13 in humans), IFN, IFN, and IFN in most mammals. type I IFNs are encoded by intronless genes clustered in mice on chromosome 4 and in humans on chromosome 9. innate and adaptive immune responses promote antigen presentation and NK cell functions, modulating inflammatory cytokine production, and activating high-affinity antigen-specific T and B cell responses. pDCs specialized in rapid secretion of high amounts of type I IFN have been termed the natural \u201cIFN producing cells\u201d (IPCs) type I IFN producing cells with plasmacytoid morphology (18\u201320) these cells detect RNA and DNA viruses through two endosomal sensors, TLR7 and TLR9, respectively, which induce secretion of type I IFN through the myD88-IRF7 signaling pathway (21\u201324). at least in the mouse, TLR7 and 9 are also expressed by monocytes, conventional DCs (cDCs) and B cells (27, 28) pDCs produce type I IFN after stimulation with vaccinia virus. two additional TLRs, TLR3 and 4 are able to induce type I IFN expression independently of the MyD88 pathway. TLR3 is absent in mouse pDCs but highly expressed in endosomes of murine CD8+ and CD103+ and human CD141+ cDCs of the DC1 subtype. soluble sensors in the cytoplasm detect dsDNA in a sequence-independent manner. this activates IRF3 and IRF7 to induce the transcription of type I IFN and other antiviral genes. gene modification References IFN6-GFP reporter mouse Ifna6gfp/+ Knock-in of a GFP reporter gene into the Ifna6 locus behind the Ifna6 promoter. endogenous IFN expression retained in homozygous reporter mouse. CreER+ Floxed Tcf4 gene crossed to tamoxifen-inducible R26-CreER mice (64) Inducible transient pDC depletion after DT administration Siglechdtr/dtr Knock-in of an IRES-driven cDNA encoding the human DTR fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) into the 3' untranslated region of the Siglech gene. type I IFN production is restricted to pDCs and tamoxifen inducible pDC specific Cre expression pDC:IRF7+ (SiglechIrf7/+; Irf3/; Irf7/) Knock-in of bicistronic cassette containing the irf7 gene locus stretching (protein coding exons) and the cDNA for Cre fused to the mutated ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor a mouse line expressing GFP under the control of the Ifna6 promoter (Ifna6gfp/+) recapitulates the expression of various IFN genes. for IFN a fluorescence reporter-knock-in mouse model (IFNmob/mob) has been generated. a firefly luciferase reporter gene has been placed under the control of the Ifnb promoter (IFN-+/luc) this model detects in vivo kinetics of IFN expression in the mouse paralleling the spread of pathogens through the organism under infectious conditions. in this mouse line, the IFN coding sequence is flanked by IFN-floxluc/floxluc. CD317 is recognized by the three different antibody clones 120G8.04, JF05-1C2.4.1 (also known as PDCA-1), and eBio927. following stimulation with type I IFNs and IFN CD317 is upregulated, additionally, on several other myeloid and lymphoid cells. in vivo treatment with clodronate-containing liposomes depletes phagocytes in mice. CLEC4A-DTR-tg mice express DTR under the human pDC specific promotor of the C-type lectin domain family 4 member A (CLEC4A; also known as blood dendritic cell antigen 2, BDCA2) administration of diphtheria toxin (DT) results in transient but specific depletion of pDCs. Loschko et al. showed pDC specific antigen delivery in mice by using SiglecH as a target structure (102) suggesting the usability of SiglecH as a lead molecule for the generation of pDC specific transgenic animals. a side by side comparison showed a higher susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes infection in DT-treated SiglecH-DTR-tg mice. Irf7 expression is driven by the siglech promoter (SiglechIrf7/+) mice. this yielded animals in which IRF7 signaling required for type I IFN expression is functional exclusively in pDCs. this mouse line can potentially be used in the future for tamoxifen inducible pDC specific Cre expression. pDCs were first described in humans as natural IPCs that activate NK cells upon exposure to viruses (16, 17) the murine equivalent was described in 2001 as type I IFN producing cells with plasmacytoid morphology (18\u201320) these cells detect RNA and DNA viruses through two endosomal sensors, TLR7 and TLR9, respectively, which induce secretion of type I IFN through the MyD88-IRF7 signaling pathway. myeloid cells also produce type I IFN after stimulation of the TLR8-MyD88-IRF7 pathway by viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) the mouse TLR8 was initially considered non-functional (33, 34) mice pDCs produce type I IFN after stimulation with vaccinia virus (33, 36) the majority of hematopoietic cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineage produce type I IFN in response to virus challenge by utilizing retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases (RLHs) (43, 45\u201347) soluble sensors in the cytoplasm detect dsDNA in a sequence-independent manner. IFN production in vivo, as intracellular staining is not sensitive in most cases. previously published IFN knock-out mouse lines already contained reporter elements to detect Ifnb promoter-driven gene transcription. coding sequences for the mouse immunoglobulin 2 chain, a green fluorescent protein (GFP), or the human CD2 had been inserted immediately downstream of the Ifnb promoter to visualize IFN expression on a cellular level. kL/L Knock-in of the gal coding sequence in-frame into exon-2 of the Ikaros gene resulting in a hypomorphic mutation (61, 62) Constitutive pDC ablation Tcf4flox/R26-CreER+ Floxed Tcf4 gene crossed to tamoxifen-inducible R26-CreER mice (64) Inducible transient pDC depletion after DT administration. pDCre BAC transgene, modified BAC encoding the complete Siglech gene locus (RP24-396N13), bicistronic cassette containing cDNAs for Cre and mCherry inserted into Siglech exon I, after the ATG (68) Constitutive restriction of type I IFN production to pDCs and tamoxifen inducible pDC specific Cre expression pDC:IRF7+. a mouse line expressing GFP under the control of the Ifna6 promoter (Ifna6gfp/+) recapitulates the expression of various IFN genes and has been employed to define the cellular source of IFN in virus infection models. mRNA linked by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) to the endogenous IFN mRNA (59) specific type I IFN subtypes can be produced by distinct cell subpopulations. a firefly luciferase reporter gene has been placed under the control of the Ifnb promoter. antibody RB6-8C5 directed against Ly6G/C reacts strongly with neutrophil-specific Ly6G antigen, but cross-reacts also with the Ly6C Ag (88) expressed on pDCs, monocytes/macrophages, activated T cells, NK cells, plasma cells, and endothelial cells. CD317 is recognized by the three different antibody clones 120G8.04, JF05-1C2.4.1 (also known as PDCA-1 constitutive deletion of E2-2, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, also known as TCF4, results in perinatal lethality in mice (98). mice harboring a constitutively deleted and a floxed Tfc4 allele (Tcf4flox/) have been crossed to itgax-Cre (CD11c-Cre) or Rosa26-CreER mice in which Cre is expressed in DCs or can be induced ubiquitously siglecH was expressed in specialized macrophage subsets, such as marginal zone macrophages (MZM), lymph node medullary macrophages, and microglia. siglecH was also found in immediate precursors of pDCs (pre-pDCs) in the BM, which have the plasticity to differentiate into pDCs. NK-T cells and splenic cDCs and CD11cint BM cells suggest that a small fraction of early lymphoid progenitors actively transcribes the SiglecH locus. this suggests that a small fraction of early lymphoid progenitors actively transcribes the SiglecH locus. a novel mouse model has been described in which type I IFN production is restricted to pDCs. in this chapter we will discuss approaches designed to define the type I IFN producing cell types in infection using the in vivo mouse models described above. we will focus on more recent findings from in vivo models aimed at visualizing IFN/ producing cell types and defining their contribution to the overall type I IFN production and their impact on the course of viral infections. herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) pDCs Subcutaneous infection, pDC depletion by anti-CD317 or anti-Ly6G/C (82) viral titers in the draining LNs day 7 p.i. type I IFN levels not measured i.v. infection, pDC depletion in depleted or control mice. Type I IFN levels in draining lymph nodes Ectromelia virus Inflammatory monocytes i.p. infection, monocyte depletion by clodronate liposomes or pDC depletion by anti-BST2 mAb 927. type I IFN levels not assessed Thogoto virus CD11b+ F4/80+ myeloid cells i.p. infection. cDCs cDC depletion in CD11c-DTR-tg mice (70, 106) Type I IFN serum levels Viral titers Diabetes La Crosse virus, Rabies virus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) Astrocytes (to a lesser extent microglia/macrophages and neurons) histology in IFN-+/luc and IFN phages, monocytes systemic NDV infection, FACS analyses in Ifna6gfp/+ reporter mice (46) n.d. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) pDCs i.p. infection, pDC depletion anti-CD317 or absence of pDCs in Itgax-Cre+ Tcf4flox/ mice (100, 124) IFN serum levels Viral titers increased 48 h i.v., 48 h p.i., phagocyte depletion by clodronate liposomes (95) IFN serum levels CD169+ macrophages marginal metallophilic macrophage and subcapsular sinus macrophage depletion in CD169-DTR-tg mice (72, 107) Type I IFN from day 4 p.i. on, persistent virus titers Chikungunya virus pDCs s.c MCMV induces a biphasic type I IFN response. peak expressions occurring at 8 h and 36\u201372 h p.i. MCMV induces a biphasic type I IFN response. pDCs have been shown to promote NK cell activation and cytotoxicity in the early phase of MCMV infection. pDCs sense the MCMV via the TLR9 and TLR7 mediated pathways. defects in myD88 signaling have a more severe impact on anti-MCMV immune responses than TLR9 deficiency or pDC depletion. mice depleted for pDCs by anti-Ly6G/C treatment showed increased viral titers in the draining lymph nodes at day 7 p.i. compared to control mice. pDCs are not required for mounting an intact type I IFN response after local infection with this dsDNA virus (118). vaginal HSV-2 infection was found nor pDCs found to contribute significantly to antiviral CD8 T cell responses after subcutaneous HSV-1 inoculation (114) this contradicting findings have been explained by the antibody-mediated depletion of additional cell types other than pDCs in contrast to the more restricted depletion in the CLEC4A-DTR-tg genetic mouse model. spleens of either DT-treated CLEC4A-DTR-tg or control mice (114) may reflect differences in the strains of HSV-1 used or differences in the promoters used to drive DTR expression (CLEC4A vs. SiglecH) in both cases a reduction of IFN serum levels were observed together with increased viral titers and reduced survival (114\u2013116) pDCs and cDCs in adenovirus infection, metallophilic macrophages and MZMs during HSV exposure are an essential source of type I IFN. pDCs mount an antiviral type I IFN response in a viral replication-independent manner. however, other ssRNA viruses have been reported to induce type I IFN expression in pDCs in a replication dependent manner (136, 137). pDCs shifted from pDCs to alveolar macrophages and cDCs. infected CD169+ subcapsular sinus macrophages produce IFN. but half of type I IFN is produced by pDCs stimulated directly or indirectly by the infected macrophages. IRF7-driven type I IFN production is restricted to pDCs. pDC:Irf7+ mice exhibited a lower viral load than Irf3/7 double deficient mice. however, as compared to WT mice higher viral tiers were detected in pDC:Irf7+ mice. rabies virus (RABV), theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and VSV that astrocytes are the main producers of IFN after infection of the brain (139) the ssRNA picornavirus with tropism for the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas can induce diabetes and myocarditis in certain mouse strains. spleen cells from mice that were depleted for pDCs by anti-Ly6G/C injection did not produce IFN in response to stimulation with inactivated influenza virus. in vivo intranasal infection with sublethal doses of influenza virus in pDC-deficient IkarosL/L and WT mice revealed a similar course of disease. pDCs appear to be essential for type IFN I mediated protection against systemic infection with the prototypical acute cytopathic coronavirus MHV. pDCs were found to be the major type I IFN producers after infection with the WE strain of LCMV. pDCs are a transient source of type I IFN. pDCs are required for type I IFN mediated protection against systemic infection in most of the RNA virus infections such as NDV, VSV, DENV, CHIKV, PVM, RSV, MHV, and LCMV. pDCs are a known source of type I IFN in retroviral and other virus infections in vivo. pDCs are a known source of type I IFN in retroviral and other virus infections in vivo. however, additional cellular sources of type I IFN are required to fully control viral infections. human and mouse cytomegalovirus Infection with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes mostly asymptomatic, latent infections in the immunocompetent host. MCMV induces a biphasic type I IFN response, with peak expressions occurring at 8 h and 36\u201372 h p.i. transient type I IFN production at the first day of MCMV infection was pDC-dependent. cells other than pDCs are responsible for the type I IFN levels measured at later timepoints. pDCs sense the MCMV via the TLR9 and TLR7 mediated pathways (18, 80, 113, 129, 130) mice depleted for pDCs by anti-Ly6G/C treatment showed increased viral titers in the draining lymph nodes. pDCs are not required for mounting an intact type I IFN response after local infection with this dsDNA virus (118). pDCs are not required for mounting an intact type I IFN response. antibody-mediated depletion in pDC depleted CLEC4A-DTR-tg mice was not found. pDCs were found to contribute significantly to antiviral CD8 T cell responses after subcutaneous HSV-1 inoculation (114) this contradicting findings have been explained by the antibody-mediated depletion of additional cell types other than pDCs. similar results were obtained in either DT-treated CLEC4A-DTR-tg or control mice. this discrepancy may reflect differences in the strains of HSV-1 used or differences in the promoters used to drive DTR expression (CLEC4A vs. SiglecH) stromal cells in MCMV infection and inflammatory monocytes in response to ECTV are an essential source of type I IFN production. MCMV induces a biphasic type I IFN response, with peak expressions occurring at 8 h and 36\u201372 h p.i. similar observations were made in IkL/L mice that lack pDCs (61) or CLEC4A-DTR-tg mice that have been transiently depleted of pDCs. pDCs have been shown to promote NK cell activation and cytotoxicity in the early phase of MCMV infection. pDCs sense the MCMV via the TLR9 and TLR7 mediated pathways. CD11b-DTR-tg mice depleted of monocytes showed increased viral titers in the liver and decreased serum levels of type I IFN after VV infection. this is similar to other studies using footpad infection of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and pDC depletion in the CLEC4A-DTR-tg mouse model. mice depleted for pDCs using anti-CD317 antibodies succumbed earlier to the infection and exhibited reduced local IFN levels. the Th1 response in draining lymph nodes developed normally (117). pDCs were not found to contribute significantly to antiviral CD8 T cell responses after subcutaneous HSV-1 inoculation. similar results were obtained in pDC depleted Siglechdtr/dtr mice. no viral replication was detected in the spleens of either DT-treated CLEC4A-DTR-tg or control mice (114). this discrepancy may reflect differences in the strains of HSV-1 used or differences in the promoters used to drive DTR expression. early after infection with MCMV pDCs are the primary source of type I IFN production capable of reducing virus titers at low concentrations of the virus. however, at later timepoints of infection CD8+ DCs rather than pDCs become the key source of type I IFN production. type I IFN induction occurs in pDCs via cytoplasmic RLHs. but other ssRNA viruses have been reported to induce type I IFN expression in pDCs in a replication dependent manner (136, 137). pDCs are sufficient to control these viruses via IRF7-regulated type I IFN responses in both systemic as well as local infection settings. pDC:Irf7+ mice were introduced in which IRF7-driven type I IFN production is restricted to pDCs. after i.v. infection with DENV pDC:Irf7+ mice exhibited a lower viral load than Irf3/7 double deficient mice. /luc luciferase reporter mouse model detected in astrocytes, microglia, and to a lesser extend also in infected neurons (122). this confirmed earlier findings where IFN/ expression in these cell types after La Crosse virus infection was visualized by immunostaining and RNA in situ hybridization (123). pDC is required for appropriate innate responses to acute PVM infection. anti-CD317 mediated depletion of pDCs abolished IFN expression and protein levels in the lungs. this correlated with increased viral titers and exacerbated immunopathology of the lungs of pDC depleted mice. mouse hepatitis Virus After i.p. infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), pDC depletion by anti-CD317 was accompanied by severely diminished IFN serum levels (124). initial viral titers in spleens were found increased more than 1,000-fold in pDC-depleted compared to control mice (124). these mice show reduced serum IFN levels and elevated viral loads in the liver and spleen (100). pDCs have been shown to be a transient source of type I IFN. pDCs have been shown to be a transient source of type I IFN. pDCs are required for type I IFN mediated protection against systemic infections. pDCs in type I IFN release and type I IFN mediated protection depends on the titer of the virus, time after infection, and the route of the infection. pDCs are functionally involved in type I IFN production mostly early during infection but are dispensable for virus control during later stages of infection. in chronic infection, however, pDCs provide type I IFN to support and preserve T cell functions. RNA viruses have been reported to induce type I IFN expression in pDCs in a replication dependent manner (136, 137) the capture of the replicating virus in the autophagosome is required for its transfer to the TLR7 containing endosomal compartment (137) pDC:Irf7+ mice were introduced in which IRF7-driven type I IFN production is restricted to pDCs. after i.v. infection with DENV pDC:Irf7+ mice exhibited a lower viral load than Irf3/7 double deficient mice. however, as compared to WT mice higher viral tiers were detected in pDC:Irf7+ mice. IFN/ expression in these cell types after la Crosse virus infection was visualized by immunostaining and RNA in situ hybridization 123. astrocytes are the main producers of IFN after infection of the brain (139) the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) strain D can induce diabetes and myocarditis in certain mouse strains. anti-CD317 mediated depletion of pDCs abolished IFN expression and protein levels in the lungs. this correlated with increased viral titers and exacerbated immunopathology of the lungs of pDC depleted mice. pDCs fulfill a substantial protective role during local RSV infection. pDC depletion by anti-CD317 was accompanied by severely diminished IFN serum levels (124) initial viral titers in spleens were found increased more than 1,000-fold in pDC-depleted compared to control mice (124). pDCs appear to be essential for type IFN I mediated protection against systemic infection with the prototypical acute cytopathic coronavirus MHV. pDCs have been shown to be a transient source of type I IFN. pDCs have been shown to be a transient source of type I IFN. pDCs are required for type I IFN mediated protection against systemic infection in most of the RNA virus infections. pDCs in type I IFN release and type I IFN mediated protection depend on the titer of the virus, time after infection, and the route of the infection. other cell types such as cDCs, macrophages, and monocytes in NDV, astrocytes in RABV, TMEV, and VSV contribute to type I IFN production. pDCs are a known source of type I IFN in retroviral infection. but the relative contribution of pDCs vs. other type I IFN producers to the overall type I IFN response is not fully understood. in bacterial infections, type I IFNs can act as activators of protective immune responses. type I IFN promotes antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium leprae. type I IFNs contribute to pathogenesis 153. PBMC-derived monocytes expressed IFN and IFN-stimulated genes. apathogenic Listeria mutant lacking listeriolysin O is unable to escape from the phagolysosome into the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Tip-DCs, an effector subtype of inflammatory monocytes, were identified as the major IFN-producing cells in vivo in systemic L. monocytogenes infections using IFNmob/mob and IFN-+/luc reporter mice. anti-PDCA-1 mediated depletion of pDCs did not lead to a difference in bacterial load or levels of type I IFN in the spleen as compared to control animals (161). in one report, CD317+ SiglecH CD19+ B cells have been found to be able to induce IFN after stimulation with heat-killed L. monocytogenes (163) iP-DCs i.v. infection, TiP-DC deficient CCR2/ mice (162) Bacterial load Type I IFN in the spleen pDCs i.p. infection, pDC depletion in Siglechdtr/dtr mice (162) Survival Proinflammatory cytokines PDCA-1+ SiglecH CD19+ B cells i.p. infection, B cell deficient Btk/ mice (163) Survival Extracellular type I IFN production has a detrimental effect on the host after infection with intracellular bacteria such as mycobacteria and L. monocytogenes. BMDCs and PBMC-derived macrophages are the responsible cell types for type I IFN production during mycobacteria infection. PBMC-derived monocytes expressed IFN and IFN-stimulated genes. this includes the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 during M. leprae infection in vitro. so far the cell type expressing type I IFN in the context of mycobacterial infections in vivo await clarification. apathogenic Listeria mutant lacking listeriolysin O is unable to escape from the phagolysosome into the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Tip-DCs harbored high bacterial loads and were located within the foci of infection in the spleen ideally positioned to activate T cells as well as NK cells via type I IFN. in vivo isolated CD317+ SiglecH CD19+ B cells activate cytotoxic function of NK cells in an IFN-dependent manner. in vivo, this B cell subset contributed positively to resistance to L. monocytogenes infection as Btk/ mice deficient for B-cells. type I IFN in the spleen pDCs i.p. infection, pDC depletion in siglechdtr/dtr mice (163) Survival Extracellular Bacteria As for intracellular bacteria also for extracellularly replicating bacterial pathogens type I IFN can either be detrimental or essential for host defense. BMDCs, PBMC-derived DCs and macrophages are the responsible cell types for type I IFN production during mycobacteria infection. the cell types identified as type I IFN producers include macrophages, inflammatory monocytes, and B cells. vivo after infection has not been analyzed in this study (170) the hypothesis that pDCs mediate their protective function in this fungal infection directly via type I IFN. pDCs mediate their protective function in this fungal infection directly via type I IFN. IFN levels in the spleen = Parasite clearance Plasmodium yoelii YM pDCs FACS analysis in IFNmob/mob reporter mice (59, 177), pDC depletion by anti-CD317 (178) or CLEC4A-DTR-tg mice (65, 177) IFN serum levels, Parasitemia Leishmania donovani B cells RT-PCR for type I IFN from ex viv cellular sources for type I IFNs have been proposed after Plasmodium infection in vitro (182\u2013184) isolated splenic pDCs as well as CD8 cDCs expressed type I IFN (173, 174) cDCs but not pDCs are required for the induction of CM (173) cDCs require IFNAR dependent signaling for systemic IFN production in this model. oelii YM infection, type I IFN enhances inflammatory blood leukocyte activation and lethal outcome. depletion of pDCs by anti-CD317 or using pDC specific CLEC4A-DTR-tg mice confirmed pDCs as the major cellular source of type I IFN in this severe malaria model. Depending on the parasite species and strain Leishmania causes mild to severe cutaneous, mucocutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis. increased production of type I IFN has been observed in local tissues and in the draining lymph nodes of L. major infected mice (187, 188). toxoplasma toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite that has infected at least 50% of the human population. it causes severe toxoplasmosis in immune-suppressed patients. most of the toxoplasma strains tested are unable to induce type I IFN production in murine BM-derived macrophages after in vitro infection (196, 197) inflammatory monocytes in the gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes were identified the major producers of IFN. malarial parasites are transmitted at sporozoite-stage by infected mosquitoes. the transmitted sporozoites rapidly travel to the liver. they initiate clinically silent but immunologically active liver-stage infection. well-established in vivo mouse models include the lethal Plasmodium yoelii YM. pDCs were not essential for parasite clearance in splenic cDCs. in splenic cDCs, splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs) generate significant quantities of IFN. pDCs, cDCs and macrophage subtypes are the cell types responsible for the generation of type I IFN response, depending on the Plasmodium species. late production of type I IFN impairs host anti-malaria immune responses by induction of negative immune regulators such as PD-L1 and IL-10. infection of murine macrophages with L. major or L. amazonensis leads to type I IFN production. in vitro exposure of BM-derived as well as splenic pDCs induces release of IFN and IFN in a TLR9-dependent manner. in vitro infection, T. gondii has been reported to induce or suppress type I IFN induction depending on the host species, the cell type, and the parasite strain analyzed. most of the toxoplasma strains tested are unable to induce type I IFN production in murine BM-derived macrophages. isolated inflammatory monocytes in the gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes were identified the major producers of IFN. the expression of IFN by inflammatory monocytes required phagocytic uptake of T. gondii, while active invasion did not trigger IFN induction (181). thus, depending on the host species, the cell type, and the parasite strain, T. gondii may induce or suppress type I IFN production. a wide variety of cells have exhibited the capacity to produce type I IFN. pDCs are more specialized than other cell types in type I IFN production. in vivo their contribution to antiviral immunity and also to immune responses to bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infection exhibits restricted patterns. new approaches to develop and improve vaccination strategies are urgently called for in a time where antibiotic resistances are projected to increase rapidly. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
