{"summary": "IDUs in 5 sites in Lang Son Province, Vietnam (n = 348) and 3 sites in Ning Ming County, Guangxi Province, China (n = 308) participants recruited through peer referral (\"snowball\") methods in both countries. participants in both countries were largely male, in their 20s, and unmarried. beyrer et al. used molecular epidemiology (mapping the different subtypes of HIV) in their reconstruction. a recent study found patterns of HIV genetic subtyping consistent with cross-border transmission either from Vietnam to China or from China to Vietnam. many people cross the border daily and seasonally to find work. there is substantial trade and migratory employment in the region. there is frequent intermarriage across the border, although this might be illegal. the project peer educators sent recruiting letters to IDUs they knew personally. the research participants received 20 Chinese yuan (approximately $2.50) for the interview, 5 yuan for each additional male respondent recruited, and 10 yuan for each additional woman recruited. a structured instrument was used for the interviews based on version 2b of the questionnaire. the questionnaire covered demographics, drug use, injection and sexual risk behavior. a question on the number of times the subject had crossed the border in the 6 months prior to the interview. all testing was conducted at the laboratory of the Guangxi Center for HIV/AIDS prevention and control in Nanning. tests were performed using the Serodia SFD screening test (Biorad France) and double ELISA (Genescreen, Biorad (France); Vironostika, Organon [9]. subject recruitment \u2013 Vietnam Approximately one-half of the sample was based on individuals initially selected from the lists of known IDUs in the project sites. the other half was based on participants initially selected from IDUs present at gathering or shooting places mapped by project staff as part of the initial project implementation. questionnaire was used in the world health organization's drug injection study. questionnaire covered demographics, drug use, injection and sexual risk behavior, HIV testing history, HIV and hepatitis knowledge, and cross-border travel patterns. it was not practical to measure all such factors. data analysis Data were entered and data sets were prepared in EpiInfo, version 6.04 by staff of the Guangxi Center for HIV/AIDS prevention and control and the National AIDS Standing Bureau of Vietnam. multi-collinearity problems precluded multivariate analyses. 1% Married 26% 32% Never Married 68% 63% HIV Prevalence 16% 46% Previous HIV test 7% 34% 1. Defined as a respondent not of Han ethnicity in China and not of Kinh ethnicity in Vietnam. only one site- (Tan Thanh in Vietnam) does not fall along this gradient. overall baseline seroprevalence among IDUs was 46% in Lang Son and in 17% Ning Ming. this gradient was statistically significant, p 0.001. despite these limitations, there are very clear patterns in the data. there are similar gradients for mean length of injecting history and baseline HIV prevalence running in descending order from the Vietnamese site farthest. majority of subjects in this study belong to ethnic minority groups. ethnic minority IDUs are more likely to be infected with HIV in many places. social stigmatization of ethnic minority communities may make them more vulnerable to illicit drug use, including injecting drug use. HIV is present among IDUs on the Chinese side of the border. it would not appear to be possible to stop IDUs from crossing the border. this will require coordinated HIV prevention that increases the likelihood that IDUs will inject safely. authors' contributions TH conceived of the study, the study design and coordination and assisted in the drafting of the manuscript.
