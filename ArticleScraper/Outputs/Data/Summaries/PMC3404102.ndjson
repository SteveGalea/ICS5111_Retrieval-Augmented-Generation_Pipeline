{"summary": "the association between HBoV-1 and respiratory disease has previously been well established. HBoV-2, HBoV-3 and HBoV-4 have been described. the role of HBoV2 as an aetiological agent of gastroenteritis has not been clearly confirmed. etiology of sporadic cases IID in the UK population was reduced to 25% from 49%. qPCR assay targeted the NS1 gene. oligonucleotide primers and probe sequences are described in table 1. the reaction consisted of 0.1 M DDT (Invitrogen), 1X Platinum Quantitative PCR Supermix-UDG (Invitrogen), Pan-HBoV-F and Pan-HBoV-R primers each at a concentration of 100 m, Pan-HBoV-NS1 probe at 10 m concentration, ROX 25 m (Invitrogen). amplification consisted of an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. followed by 40 cycles with denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 sec. annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 sec and extension at 60\u00b0C for 45 sec. qPCR assay targeted the NS1 gene (Ratcliff et al., unpublished method, personal communication) and was performed using an ABI Taqman7500. oligonucleotide primers and probe sequences are described in table 1.

HBoV in the presence of other enteric pathogens HBoV DNA was found in 149 (46%) samples in the absence of other co-pathogens. HBoV in the absence of any other enteric pathogens was found in 29% of the cases, but in 56% of the controls. HBoV infections were detected year round although a peak was observed in the spring/early summer months between April and June 1994. distribution of HBoV by Gender HBoV DNA was found in 48.8% and 45.7% of female cases and controls. 1 8 6 40 58 5\u20139 1 1 7 9 10\u201319 2 1 2 5 20\u201329 2 5 7 30\u201339 3 5 8 40\u201349 2 9 11 50\u201359 3 5 8 >70 2 2 4 60\u201369 5 5 CASES Total 4 2 32 10 101 149 Percent 2.7 1.3 21.5 6.7 67.8 100.0 CONTROLS 1 10 1 10 4 37 62 1\u20134 14 8 6 63 91 5\u20139 1 7 8 10\u201319 2 2 CASES CONTROLS ALLTOTAL Age Group (years) HBoV pos % TOTAL HBoV pos % TOTAL POR HBoV pos % TOTAL 1 34 26.2 130 62 34.8 178 0.66514 96 31.2 308 1\u20134 58 12.2 476 91 18.0 506 0.633 149 15.2 982 5\u20139 9 6.9 131 8 6.0 134 1.16112 17 6.4 2 HBoV in the Presence of Other Enteric Pathogens HBoV DNA was found in 149 (46%) samples in the absence of other co-pathogens. in the 1\u20134 years of age group, HBoV in the absence of any other enteric pathogens was found in 29% of the cases, but in 56% of the controls. distribution of HBoV among females and males was not significantly different from the distribution of females and males in the entire cohort. the prevalence of HBoV-2 in the absence of any other pathogen was not significantly different between cases and controls. the prevalence of HBoV-2 in children 5 years old was however not significantly different between cases and controls.

HBoV-1 was found predominantly in controls (p0.001) and HBoV-3 was similar in cases and controls. a lack of correlation between HBoVs or HBoV-2 and paediatric gastroenteritis was also reported in several smaller studies published elsewhere. a total of 67% of the HBoV-positive samples could not be genotyped using the genotype-specific PCR assays. in respiratory infections significantly higher HBoV loads were seen in samples collected from children positive for HBoV alone. in respiratory infections also, viral loads >104 were associated with disease, whereas loads 104 were associated with asymptomatic children [33], [38]. this lead to the suggestion that higher viral loads are indicative of a causative role of HBoV in respiratory infections [33], [38]."}
