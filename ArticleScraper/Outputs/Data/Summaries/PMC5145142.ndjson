{"summary": "equine viral arteritis virus (EVA) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. it is the causative agent of equine viral arteritis (EVA) a respiratory, systemic, and reproductive disease of horses. the disease is characterized by fever (greater than 41\u00b0C); depression; leukopenia; rhinitis often accompanied by nasal discharge; urticaria; and edema [ the experimentally derived virulent Bucyrus strain (VBS) of EAV can infect CD3+ T lymphocytes in vitro from some but not all horses. in one study, 310 horses of Thoroughbred, Standardbred, Saddlebred, and Quarter horse breeds were tested and their phenotypes identified with respect to in vitro infection of their CD3+ T lymphocytes by the VBS of EAV. the EqCXCL16 gene has three alleles, two coding for the susceptibility phenotype (EqCXCL16Sa and EqCXCL16Sb) and one coding for the resistant phenotype (EqCXCL16R). compelling evidence is provided that allelic variation within EqCXCL16 is a major determining factor for establishment of long-term persistent EAV infection in the stallion reproductive tract. 12 non-synonymous SNPs were found in exons for eight annotated genes within the target region. no translational frame-shift insertions or deletions were found within any previously annotated exon. SNPs within the equine orthologue of the gene encoding the chemokine CXCL16 (EqCXCL16) are associated with susceptibility of CD3+ T lymphocytes to EAV infection. only the SNPs associated with the equine orthologue of the gene encoding the chemokine CXCL16 (EqCXCL16) showed a complete association.

HEK-EqCXCL16S, HEK-EqCXCL16R, and c) nave HEK-293T cells were infected with EAV sVBSmCherry at an MOI = 1. after fixation in 4% PFA at 12 hpi, cells were analyzed with an inverted immunofluorescence microscope for the expression of EAV nsp-1 gene. expression of mCherry in HEK- HEK-EqCXCL16S cells were infected with a plasma membrane-associated EqCXCL16S isoform. the plasma membrane-associated EqCXCL16S isoform can function as an efficient cellular receptor for EAV while EqCXCL16R does not. the results demonstrate that the plasma membrane-associated EqCXCL16S isoform can function as an efficient cellular receptor for EAV. no bands were visible in a control experiment where the binding step was omitted. the monomeric form of CXCL16S has an apparent molecular weight of 30 kDa. this was confirmed by stripping the membrane depicted in panel a of Fig 3. Nave HEK-293T, stable HEK-EqCXCL16S and HEK-EqCXCL16R cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, the lysate proteins separated using 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. membranes were incubated with -GP5 MAb 6D10 and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method. hek-EqCXCL16S cells were incubated with biotinylated EAV VBS on ice for 2 h in the dark. cells were then stained with Streptavidin-FITC and DAPI solution. significantly higher number of HEK-EqCXCL16S cells were observed to bind biotinylated EAV (panel a) the HEK-EqCXCL16S, HEK-EqCXCL16R, and nave HEK-293T control cells were incubated with Dil labelled OxLDL (Dil-OxLDL) the highest levels of Dil-OxLDL binding and potential internalization were observed in the HEK-EqCXCL16S. a marked increase in Dil-OxLDL binding and internalization was shown in HEK-EqCXCL16S (b) as compared to nave HEK-293T (a), or HEK-EqCXCL16R (c), or HEK-EqCXCL16R cells treated with Gp -EqCXCL16 pAb (d) both variants of EqCXCL16 bind to the equine CX incubated with purified recombinant EqCXCL16S or EqCXCL16R protein. similar signal levels were observed with both EqCXCL16 isoforms. there was no non-specific reactivity between the EqCXCL16 isoforms and the anti-His antibody with BSA. CL16S and EqCXCL16R were enriched using anti-CD3 conjugated magnetic beads to > 95% purity based on the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes present in the population. 6% of this enriched CD3+ T lymphocyte population had detectable cell-surface expression of EqCXCR6. incubation of enriched equine CD3+ T lymphocyte preparations at 37\u00b0C provided clearest evidence that EqCXCL16 possessed chemoattractant potential compared to the medium only control (P0.001) there were no statistically significant differences between the S and R isoforms in numbers of EqCXCR6 expressing CD3+ T lymphocytes entering the chamber. controls consisted of RPMI with 0.5% BSA and EqCXCL16 (S and R) pre-treated by incubation. no statistically significant differences were found in chemoattractant potential between recombinant EqCXCL16S and EqCXCL16R proteins. HEK-293T, HEK-EqCXCL16S and HEK-EqCXCL16R cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h before incubation with 0.5M EDTA for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. the dye was then extracted with 10% acetic acid prior to determining OD595nm values. two horses (Thoroughbred-10 [TB10] and Standardbred-22 [STB22] possessed CD3+ T lymphocytes with the EAV susceptible phenotype. the corresponding cells in Thoroughbred-3 (TB03) were resistant. the distribution of SNPs within ECA11: 48M-51M was compared.

Glu in EqCXCL16R is also present in the white rhinoceros. exon 1 of CXCL16 has been exposed to considerable selective pressure over time. exon 1 of EqCXCL16 was PCR amplified and sequenced from all 77 stallions to determine each stallion\u2019s genotype. the results showed a strong, although incomplete, association between long-term EAV carrier status in stallions and the presence of at least one copy of the EqCXCL16Sa or EqCXCL16Sb allele among 86% of the stallions with that phenotype. sian 1 0 American Saddlebred 1 0 Dutch Warmblood 4 3 Westphalian 1 0 Holsteiner 0 1 Belgian 0 1 Percheron 0 1 Belgian 0 1 Trakehner 0 1 Danish Warmblood 0 1 Zangersheide 0 2 Table 6. Association of CXCL16 alleles with carrier and non-carrier status of stallions for EAV shedding in semen (n = 77) XCL16R cells were compared using confocal microscopy. results confirm variant forms of EqCXCL16 were produced in apparently similar amounts. ability of EqCXCL16 to function as an entry receptor for EAV is determined by amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal ectodomain of the protein encoded by exon 1. HEK-293T (a), HEK-EqCXCL16S (b) and HEK-EqCXCL16R (c) cells were infected with EAV sVBSmCherry (synthetic virus expressing mCherry) at a multiplicity of infection of 1 (MOI = 1). at 12 hours post infection, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) expression of mCherry in HEK-EqCXCL16R cells infected at the same MOI with EAV sVBSmCherry was almost undetectable at the same time point. this result was confirmed in experiments where EAV gene expression following infection was detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using a monoclonal antibody against viral nonstructural protein 1 (nsp-1 expression was detectable in a few EAV infected equal amounts of total lysate from HEK-EqCXCL16S, HEK-EqCXCL16R, and mock transfected HEK-293T cells were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. refolded membrane-bound prey proteins were incubated with purified EAV VBS (bait protein) two strong signals were detected with apparent molecular weights (MW) of approximately 52 and 30 kDa in a strong signal at 52 kDa is unlikely to be the result of interactions between EAV VBS and another cellular protein. this was only visible in HEK-EqCXCL16S and HEK-EqCXCL16R lysates. a strong signal at 52 kDa is unlikely to be the result of interactions between EAV VBS and another cellular protein. the same membrane (a) was stripped and re-probed with Gp anti-EqCXCL16. the same membrane (a) was detected at the same position on the membrane where EAV GP5 was detected in panel a. B. HEK-EqCXCL16S, HEK-EqCXCL16R, and nave HEK-293T cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C to prevent internalization. fluorescence microscopy revealed significantly higher number of HEK-EqCXCL16S cells bound to biotinylated EAV VBS compared to the HEK-EqCXCL16R or control HEK-293T cells. fected nave HEK-293T and HEK-EqCXCL16S cells were significantly reduced by prior treatment with a polyclonal antibody against EqCXCL16. this suggests a high degree of specificity in reactivity between Dil-OxLDL and the \u201cS\u201d form of the EqCXCL16 chemokine. this confirms that four amino acid substitutions in the ectodomain of the EqCXCL16S is HEK-EqCXCL16S (b) as compared to nave HEK-293T (a), or HEK-EqCXCL16R (c), or HEK-EqCXCL16S cells treated with Gp -EqCXCL16 pAb (d) both variants of EqCXCL16 bind to the equine CXC-chemokine receptor 6 (EqCXCR6) protein in vitro 16 isoforms and the anti-His antibody with BSA showed no significant differences in binding to the EqCXCR6 receptor protein in vitro. interactions between purified recombinant EqCXCL16S/R-EqCXCR6 were examined using Far-WB. equine CD3+ T lymphocytes derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were enriched using anti-CD3 conjugated magnetic beads to > 95% purity. 6% of this enriched CD3+ T lymphocyte population had detectable cell-surface expression of EqCXCR6 as determined by staining with rabbit anti-EqCXCR6 antibody (PA7511) equine chemokine isoforms were pre-incubated with Gp -EqCXCL16 pAb. no statistically significant differences were found in chemoattractant potential between recombinant EqCXCL16S and EqCXCL16R proteins. HEK-EqCXCL16S, HEK-EqCXCL16R, and nave control HEK-293T cells were tested using a previously described protocol [53] to evaluate resistance to detachment from the cell culture plate following incubation for 10 min at 37\u00b0C with 0.5M EDTA. HEK-EqCXCL16S, HEK-EqCXCL16R, and nave control HEK-293T cells were a representative image of a 24-well plate stained with crystal violet following EDTA treatment showing the differences in adhesion of different HEK-293T-derived cells. hek-EqCXCL16S cells possess significantly higher adhesion properties that can be eliminated by pre-treatment with Gp -EqCXCL16 pAb. a, b, c, and d are significantly different. whole genome sequencing of one resistant and two resistant horses revealed 12 non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions. the gene for EqCXCL16S was dominant and correlated completely with the EAV-susceptible CD3+ T lymphocyte phenotype. at least three of the SNPs located within EqCXCL16Sa, EqCXCL16Sb, and EqCXCL16R are predicted to induce non-conservative or even radical soluble and membrane-bound forms of human CXCL16 (HuCXCL16) are expressed on dendritic cells, CD14+ monocytes/macrophages, CD21+ B lymphocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and keratinocytes [30\u201337] also interact with its receptor CXCR6 (also known as STRL33/BONZO/TYMSTR) soluble form of EqCXCL16 has chemotactic activity for CXCR6 expressing T lymphocytes. soluble form of EqCXCL16 has chemotactic activity for CXCR6 expressing T lymphocytes. soluble form of EqCXCL16 has chemotactic activity for expressing T lymphocytes. this suggests amino acid residues located at positions 40 to 52 within the chemokine domain of EqCXCL16 have a direct role in viral attachment via interactions with EAV membrane surface glycoproteins. this suggests amino acid residues located at positions 40 to 52 within the chemokine domain of EqCXCL16 have a direct role in viral attachment via interactions with EAV membrane surface glycoproteins. the exact mechanism(s) of CXCL16 in infection of equine CD3+ T lymphocytes is yet to be determined. the exact mechanism(s) of CXCL16 in infection of equine CD3+ T lymphocytes is yet to be determined. a subpopulation of equine CD3+ T lymphocytes expresses transmembrane (TM) form of EqCXCL16S (i.e. horses with the CD3+ T lymphocyte subpopulation susceptible to in vitro EAV infection; A) or TM-EqCXCL16R (i.e. horses that lack the CD3+ T lymphocyte subpopulation susceptible to in vitro EAV infection; B) on their cell surface and EAV could the association between the EqCXCL16 genotype and long-term carrier status in stallions is of major importance because these animals are key to the survival of this virus in equid populations. however, the correlation between carrier status in stallions and EqCXCL16 allelic content was strong but not absolute. inflammatory infiltrates in close proximity to viral antigen-expressing cells are frequently observed in the stallion reproductive tract. potential explanations range from some form of localized immunosuppression based on the fact that androgens like testosterone can down-regulate immune responses. polymorphisms of CXCL16 have been reported in the human CXCL16 gene. these polymorphisms have not been shown to completely abrogate the chemokine, scavenger receptor properties. the horse may therefore be highly unusual in possessing allelic variants of this gene with SNPs situated in exon 1. the animal protocol involving horses was approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; protocol number 2013\u20131098) the animal protocol involving rabbits and guinea pigs was approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. HEK-293T cells stably expressing EqCXCL16S and EqCXCL16R were propagated in DMEM with 10% ferritin-supplemented bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc.) and 100 U/ml of penicillin. PBMCs were isolated from the buffy-coat fraction by centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque Plus (Covidien, Ireland) PBMCs were blocked with 5% normal mouse serum and then incubated with anti-equine CD3 (Clone UC F6G) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 for 30 min. cells were then incubated with anti-equine CD3 (Clone UC F6G) for 20 min. the cells were then washed with MACS buffer and applied to an LS column, washed three times, and the bound CD3+ T lymphocytes purified preparations of each strain of EAV were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and frozen at -80\u00b0C for 4 h to pellet the virus. 240 horses from four different breeds, Thoroughbred (TB; n = 67), American Saddlebred (ASB; n = 60), and Quarter Horses (QH; n = 53) were randomly selected for sequencing. EAV long-term shedders were defined as those horses that had detectable EAV in their semen for more than one year following infection where date of exposure was known. non-shedders were those which likely shed EAV in their semen during the acute phase of infection but that had ceased shedding virus at the time of initial testing. ed and phenotyped for the CD3+ T lymphocyte susceptibility (S) or resistance (R) phenotype based on dual-color flow cytometric analysis in previous study.
