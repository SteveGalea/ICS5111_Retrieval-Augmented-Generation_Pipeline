{"summary": "forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma-like protein 1 regulates the transcription of genes involved in a variety of processes, including cell cycle regulation [2, 3], apoptosis [4, 5], DNA repair [6], and autophagy [7\u20139]. FOXO3A is considered to be a potential tumor suppressor gene and is involved in the regulation of differentiation in various cell types [13\u201316] DAC is incorporated into newly synthesized double-stranded DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle without affecting elongation. it is possible to enhance the impact of DAC on cellular activity by extending the treatment duration. DAC-induced differentiation has been primarily observed at low doses. eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% FBS (Gibco Life Technologies) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were seeded at a density of 5 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. every 48 hours, the medium in the wells was replaced with fresh medium containing 0.5 M DAC. the transfected cells were either cultured or treated with 0.5 M DAC for 48 hours as required. DAC-treated cells were collected and washed once in PBS, before being counted and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 107 cells/ml. DAC-treated cells were then dried naturally onto antioff slides. apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry within an hour using a flow cytometer (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) the cell cycle stages of the SKM-1 cells were assessed using a PI staining assay kit. either 10 l FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 or FITC-conjugated anti-CD11b antibodies or FITC- or APC-conjugated isotype controls (Becton Dickinson) were added to the cells as appropriate, mixed gently, and incubated in darkness at room temperature for 15 minutes. cells were then washed once in PBS and resuspended in 200 l PBS. within 1 hour, surface markers Membranes were washed three times for 5 minutes in 0.1% TBST. then incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) the intensity of bands was quantified using Image Lab software version 2.0. cellular transfection Cells were transfected with either Silencer\u00ae Select FOXO3a (cat. number 4392420) or Silencer Select Negative Control (cat. number 4390843) siRNAs. the transfected cells were either cultured or treated with 0.5 M DAC for 48 hours. cells were collected and washed once in PBS, before being counted and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 107 cells/ml. cells were then dried naturally onto antioff slides (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) at room temperature, before being fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 minutes. slides were incubated for 5 minutes in darkness within a humidity chamber. cells were washed once in cold PBS and resuspended in 75% ethanol. concentration was adjusted to 2 106 cell/tube using 75% ethanol. cell cycle stages were examined by flow cytometry within an hour. Western Blot Analysis Proteins were extracted from cells using RIPA buffer with 1 protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) the concentration of total protein was determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Beyotime Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were then washed three times for 5 minutes in 0.1% TBST and then incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. images were obtained using Bio-Rad ChemiDocTM XRS+ Imaging System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) the intensity of bands was quantified using Image Lab software version 2.0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), and GAPDH was used as an internal standard. the significance of differences between groups was assessed using Student's t-test. DAC treatment significantly reduced the relative expression of the inactive p-FOXO3A form, resulting in a consequent increase in the FOXO3A/p-FOXO3A ratio. DAC treatment significantly reduced the relative expression of the inactive form, resulting in a consequent increase in the FOXO3A/p-FOXO3A ratio. DAC treatment of cells treated with siRNAs targeting FOXO3A. the expression of FOXO3A following DAC treatment was significantly lower in cells treated with the siRNA targeting FOXO3A. no significant differences in the surface expression of CD14 and CD11b were observed between SKM-1 cells where FOXO3A was silenced and nonsilenced controls. DAC treatment could decrease cells in S phase and arrest SKM-1 cells in G0/G1 and G2/M phases. CDKN1A and CDKN1B levels examined in Western blot were both increased after DAC treatment in SKM-1 cells. DAC induces cell cycle arrest in SKM-1 cells. DAC-treated cells were stained with Hoechst 33342. DAC induces apoptosis in SKM-1 cells. 33342 assay detected that DAC treatment could induce apoptosis in SKM-1 cells after DAC treatment. BCL2L11, not FASLG, was increased after DAC treatment in SKM-1 cells. DAC treatment had no significant effect on FASLG expression. expression of the proapoptotic molecule BCL2L11 was significantly decreased after FOXO3A silencing. the reduction in BCL2L11 expression observed following FOXO3A silencing was not reversed by subsequent DAC treatment. this suggests that FOXO3A might be required for the later stages, but not the early stages, of DAC-induced apoptosis. FOXO3A contributes to DAC-mediated autophagy in SKM-1 cells. LC3-I and LC3-II were both increased after DAC treatment. LC3-I, LC3-II BECN1 and ATG5-ATG12-ATG16 complex proteins were decreased after FOXO3A silencing. FOXO3A silencing remained significantly lower than in DAC-treated cells. DAC treatment of nonsilenced SKM-1 cells upregulated expression of these autophagy-related proteins. but this upregulation was attenuated on FOXO3A silencing resulting in lower protein expression levels. FOXO3A was predominant in SKM-1 cells, indicating that FOXO3A exists primarily in the inactive form. DAC treatment significantly reduced the relative expression of the inactive p-FOXO3A form, resulting in a consequent increase in the FOXO3A/p-FOXO3A ratio. no significant difference in FOXO3A expression was seen following DAC treatment of cells treated with siRNAs targeting FOXO3A (P = 0.729) the expression of FOXO3A following DAC treatment was significantly lower in cells treated with the siRNA targeting FOXO3A than in cells that did not undergo NT-siRNA treatment. DAC treatment could decrease cells in S phase and arrest SKM-1 cells in G0/G1 and G2/M phases. CDKN1A and CDKN1B levels examined in Western blot were both increased after DAC treatment in SKM-1 cells. some studies have reported MYC to be a downstream target of FOXO3A. DAC-induced MYC downregulation is not dependent on active FOXO3A. DAC induces cell cycle arrest in SKM-1 cells. apoptosis occurred in SKM-1 cells after DAC treatment. BCL2L11 and FASLG proteins were examined in Western blot. DAC treatment had no significant effect on FASLG expression. western blot analysis showed that silencing FOXO3A did not significantly affect apoptosis in SKM-1 cells. Interestingly, FOXO3A silencing inhibited the accumulation of SKM-1 cells in the later stages of apoptosis that was observed following DAC treatment. the reduction in BCL2L11 expression observed following FOXO3A silencing was not reversed by subsequent DAC treatment. autophagy initiation protein BECN1 and the ATG5-ATG12-ATG16 complex proteins were both upregulated following DAC treatment. LC3-I, LC3-II BECN1 and ATG5-ATG12-ATG16 complex proteins were both upregulated following DAC treatment. DAC was higher than in untreated cells, indicating the partial induction of autophagy. DAC treatment of nonsilenced SKM-1 cells upregulated expression of these autophagy-related proteins. this upregulation was attenuated on FOXO3A silencing resulting in lower protein expression levels. DAC significantly increased the expression of CDKN1A from a trace basal level in SKM-1 cells. DAC-induced apoptosis occurs in parallel with a TP53-dependent, but DNMT1-independent, upregulation of CDKN1A. DAC-induced apoptosis occurs in parallel with a TP53-dependent, but DNMT1-independent, upregulation of CDKN1A. both FOXO3A and MYC interact functionally with the forkhead binding element in the CDKN1B proximal promoter [34], meaning that MYC may inhibit the activation of CDKN1B by FOXO3A in tumor cells. this could indicate that MYC is a downstream target of FOXO3A and that the tumor-suppressive properties of FOXO3A may be related to MYC inhibition. high doses of 5-azacitidine (5-AZA; 2 M) can reportedly activate FOXO3A and thus upregulate BCL2L11 expression. this treatment had no significant effect on FASLG expression. autophagy, a vital mechanism for maintaining energy balance and metabolic homeostasis in cells, plays no role in SKM-1 cells. the autophagy occurring with other traditional chemotherapy drugs may constitute a compensatory mechanism to protect cells from drug-induced damage and apoptosis. it is therefore not possible to determine whether the autophagy that is observed in SKM-1 cells in response to DAC treatment is a drug-induced protective stress response or a cytotoxic response."}
