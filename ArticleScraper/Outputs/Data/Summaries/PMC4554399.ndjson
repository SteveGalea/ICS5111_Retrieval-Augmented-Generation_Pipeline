{"summary": "acute otitis media (AOM) occurs in 20%\u201360% of cases of VRTIs. almost 60% of children with VRTI have changes in the maxillary, ethmoidal, and frontal sinuses. mucins, which are charged glycoproteins, are the main components of mucus. they assist the innate immune system through their anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. however, overproduction of those mucins might have a paradoxical effect. respiratory virus-infected epithelia facilitates the attraction of inflammatory cells, including natural killer cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils. the airway epithelium consists of many molecules including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion 1 (CEACAM-1) and platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF-r) studies have shown that the RSV virus induces the adherence of S. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenza to airway epithelial cells. adenovirus and rhinovirus play the same role in the adherence of S. pneumoniae to the airway epithelial cells. inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- produced in response to infection could be detrimental to the host cells. inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- produced in response to infection can increase the inflammatory response to TLR ligands including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) adenovirus and rhinovirus play the same role in the adherence of S. pneumoniae to the airway epithelial cells;8,44 however, the measles virus decreases the risk of adherence of streptococcal bacteria. bacterial adhesion might also be a result of the upregulation of surface receptors including PAF-r. the influenza virus (H1N1) was the culprit of the severe pneumococcal pneumonia outbreak among children that occurred in Iowa in the mid-1990s. a study in france showed that influenza virus infection was the direct cause of CAP in 12% of children. the most common bacteria isolated from tympano-centesis were H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Mycoplasma pneumonia. the rates of bacteremia and OM were 18% and 44%, respectively, in children with viral-induced bronchiolitis. the study concluded that febrile infants with enterovirus had a coexisting rate of serious bacterial infection of 6.6%. the human myxovirus resistance protein 1 is an important intermediary of the IFN-induced antiviral response against a variety of viruses. a viral disease may be a superior method for diminishing complications from influenza. it is prudent to vaccinate patients with the influenza vaccine to diminish the risk of OM in children and pneumonia in adults. the vaccine is effective in reducing all-cause AOM86\u201388 and pneumonia89 compared to placebo in children. b (MedImmune) has a higher affinity for RSV fusion protein than palivizumab. can prevent against medically attended lower respiratory tract infection. similar emphasis must be given to prevention and treatment of viral illnesses."}
