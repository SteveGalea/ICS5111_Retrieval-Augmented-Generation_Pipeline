{"summary": "in affluent societies, the burden of such infections may be even higher. deaths from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other associated LRTIs are several times more frequent in developing than in developed countries. in brazil, RSV is the most common viral pathogen found in episodes of LRTI. children from 0 to 24 months of age were hospitalized due to an LRTI in 4 capitals (Aracaj, Salvador, Recife, and Macei\u00f3) from northeastern Brazil over a period of 1 year. we also seek to evaluate the association between the frequency of LRTI in general, of RSV, and of other viruses and meteorological data (temperature, precipitation, humidity, and solar radiation) the study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees of each of the 4 participating institutions. a sample size of 504 subjects was estimated in order to allow for a 95% confidence interval (CI) of. 4% around an estimated point prevalence of RSV infection of 30%. this was considered a plausible average of the rates found in previous studies. the study population comprised all children included in the study. all study procedures were done during a single initial visit for every enrolled patient. there was no follow-up data after the 1st visit on patients enrolled. the study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees. NPA was sent to a central laboratory for detection of the following viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by PCR product hybridization on low-density microarrays. results were not known immediately by investigators, so patient care was based on clinical presentation. a sample size of 504 subjects was estimated in order to allow for a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 4% around an estimated point prevalence of RSV infection of 30%. RESULTS Baseline Patient Characteristics and Disposition Between April 2012 and march 2013, legal representatives of 513 children signed an informed consent form and underwent the study visit. 5 patients were not eligible because their respiratory symptoms started longer than 7 days before study participation. there was no exclusion due to use of Palivizumab in any participant. nearly two-thirds of patients had at least 1 proven viral infection. the overall prevalence of each of the other viruses was 17% for rhinovirus, 5.9% for metapneumovirus, 5.5% for parainfluenza and bocavirus, 3.7% for adenovirus and 3.2% for influenza. statistically significant risk factors in multivariate analysis were decreasing age upon study entry, decreasing gestational age, attendance of daycare or other collective environment, and lower educational level of the father. no statistically significant risk factors were found for other viruses in multivariate analysis, except for increasing age upon study entry. there were no statistically significant correlations between the frequency of other viral infections and any of the meteorological variables investigated. there were negative correlations between temperature and the number of cases of both influenza and adenovirus infections, as well as a positive correlation between precipitation and the number of cases of bocavirus infections. there was no exclusion due to use of Palivizumab in any participant. the frequency of hypoxemia differed markedly across centers, what could reflect the different profile of the centers related to emergency/general wards and ICU hospitalizations. the mean duration of nonexclusive breastfeeding was 3.7 months; however, a normalized analysis describing this duration as a percentage of the ideal duration of 6 months. number (%) of cases of lower Respiratory Tract Infections Along 1 year, by Center and Overall TABLE 3. Relative Frequency (95% CI) of Proven Viral Infections Related Risk Factors for Different Viruses Statistically significant possible related risk factors for viral infections in multivariate analysis were decreasing age upon study entry, increasing weight, and lower educational level of the father. the monthly frequency of each viral infection along 1 year is shown in Figure 1. Statistically significant associations were found between the frequency of viral infections in general and both temperature and humidity. there were no statistically significant correlations between the frequency of other viral infections and any of the meteorological variables investigated. 7 of the 8 tested viruses were found using RT-PCR in 66.5% of children hospitalized because of an LRTI in 4 centers located in major cities of northeastern Brazil, a tropical region. the most commonly detected virus was RSV, which was found in 40.2% (95% CI, 35.9%\u201344.7%) of children. compared to children between 0 and 16 years old, coinfections were found in less than 1% of them. the same group also reported their attempt to investigate parainfluenza infections among children from Fortaleza. oxygen saturation, which was not measured in 2.8% of cases, was assessed upon admission in 34.7% of children. during the study visit in the remaining 62.8%, this may represent a limitation of our study. 88.5% of cases occurred from late summer to mid-autumn in 1 study. in another the frequency was higher in autumn and near-negligible in winter. results from a study on RSV circulation in 7 countries suggest that RSV prevalence is higher during wet months in climates with high annual precipitation."}
