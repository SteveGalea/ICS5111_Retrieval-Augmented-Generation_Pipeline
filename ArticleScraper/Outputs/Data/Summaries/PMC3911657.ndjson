{"summary": "exposure to the Giant Virus Mimivirus may promote Arthritis Giant DNA viruses such as Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus. a third of human beings display a serum IgG response against the main mimivirus capsid protein. antibody responses to endogenous collagen were frequent in persons with rheumatoid arthritis. human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) genomes also display higher viral genome copy numbers, viral transcript levels, and viral late protein expression than those of wild-type genomes. this work suggests that the complete HPV16 replication cycle is unexpectedly restrained by a viral protein. intracellular sensors activate innate immune cells and increase inflammatory responses associated with induction of adaptive immunity."}
