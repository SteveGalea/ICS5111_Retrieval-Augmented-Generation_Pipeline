{"summary": "coronaviruses are a family of enveloped viruses with positive sense, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA genomes. avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) reduces the performance of both meat-type and egg-laying chickens. some coronaviruses infect humans and account for a significant percentage of adult common colds. coronaviruses can cross species barrier to become lethal human pathogens. studies on coronaviruses are both economically and medically important. coronaviruses are spherical or pleomorphic in shape with a mean diameter 80\u2013120 nm. the genome, ranging from 27,000 to 32,000 nucleotides in size, is the largest RNA genomes known to date. the genome, ranging from 27,000 to 32,000 nucleotides in size, is the largest RNA genomes known to date. replicase gene consists of two open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) translation of replicase polyprotein 1a produces 11 non-structural proteins (nsp1\u2013nsp11), while pp1ab produces 15 non-structural proteins (nsp1\u2013nsp10 and nsp12\u2013nsp16). replicase synthesizes negative sense genomic RNAs. replicase synthesizes nested set of subgenomic RNAs. sgRNAs are used as templates for synthesizing positive sense RNA genomes. ER is the major site for synthesis and folding of secreted and transmembrane proteins. unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER and lead to ER stress. ER stress can also be activated by excessive lipids or pro-inflammatory cytokines. ER stress can be activated by excessive lipids or pro-inflammatory cytokines. apoptosis is induced for the entire organism during coronavirus infection. the integrated stress response pathways trigger translation shutdown and modulate apoptosis. the IRE1 pathway affects both ER folding and apoptosis induction. data from this group have shown a similar induction of ER stress in IBV-infected Vero, H1299, and Huh-7 cells. no parallel studies have been performed on Alphacoronaviruses. it is likely that all three genera of coronaviruses may induce ER stress in the infected cells. infection of SARS-CoV reorganizes the ER into a reticulovesicular network. the EDEMosomes are COPII-independent vesicles that export from the ER. they are normally used to fine-tune the level of ER degradation enhancer. glycosylation of M protein proposed to play a certain function in alpha interferon (IFN) induction and in vivo tissue tropism. pre-glycosylated S monomers are around 128\u2013160 kDa. sizes can reach 150\u2013200 kDa post-glycosylation (exclusively N-linked) treatment of -glucosidase inhibitors inhibits the incorporation of S into pseudovirus and suppresses SARS-CoV replication in cell cultures. coronavirus infection results in: (1) massive morphological rearrangement of the ER; (2) significant increase ER burden for protein synthesis, folding and modification; (3) extensive depletion of ER lipid component. coronavirus-induced DMVs are induced in HEK293T cells co-expressing the SARS-CoV nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6. the late endosomes, autophagosomes, and the early secretary pathway have all been implicated as the membrane source of DMVs. all coronavirus structural proteins are transmembrane proteins synthesized in the ER. the M protein is known to undergo either O-linked (for most betacoronaviruses) or N-linked (for all alpha- and gammacoronaviruses) glycosylation. the folding, maturation, and assembly of the gigantic S trimeric glycoprotein rely heavily on the protein chaperons inside the ER, such as calnexin. knock-down of calnexin decreases the infectivity of pseudotyped lentivirus carrying the SARS-CoV S protein. the PERK branch of the UPR is believed to be activated first in response to ER stress. eIF2 forms a stable complex with and inhibits the turnover of eIF2B. eIF2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that recycles inactive eIF2-GTP. mRNAs of certain genes contain small ORFs in their 5\u2032 UTR. one of these is the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) which is preferentially translated under ISR. one of ATF4\u2019s target genes is the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (GADD153) eIF2 activation can lead to reduced inhibition of IB on NF-B. translation attenuation has been widely observed as a defensive mechanism of the host cells against viral infection. virus infection, massive production of viral proteins can overload folding capacities of ER and lead to activation of another eIF2 kinase \u2013 PERK. similar to PKR, viruses have adopted counter measures to inhibit PERK-mediated translation attenuation. eIF2 dephosphorylation in cells infected with MHV A59 induces translation repression of most cellular proteins. the translation of MHV mRNAs seems to be resistant to eIF2 phosphorylation. eIF2 phosphorylation is readily detectable in virus-infected cells. coronaviruses employ multiple mechanisms to antagonize the IFN response. for example, the nsp16 has been shown to utilize the 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity to modify coronavirus mRNAs. the activities of several IFN-induced genes have also been shown to be modulated by coronaviruses during infection. phosphorylation of eIF2 is likely due to the accumulation of GADD34. this is a component of the PP1 complex and a downstream target gene induced by GADD153. the up-regulation of GADD153 was likely mediated by both PKR and PERK. bridge stress and innate immunity is GADD34, a negative regulator of eIF2 activation. the integrated stress response pathways were activated in dendritic cells. this led to up-regulation of ATF4 and GADD34. transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) is a master regulator of pro-inflammatory response and innate immunity. it has been well established that NF-B is required for the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and IL-8) and the early expression of IFN- during RNA virus infection. a protein phosphatase called dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) was also up-regulated in IBV-infected cells. a protein phosphatase called dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) was also up-regulated in IBV-infected cells and dephosphorylated p38 to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production. PERK-EIF2-ATF4 is believed to be activated first in response to ER stress. phosphorylated eIF2 forms a stable complex with and inhibits the turnover of eIF2B. eIF2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that recycles inactive eIF2-GTP. the mRNAs of certain genes contain small ORFs in their 5\u2032 UTR. one of these is the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which is preferentially translated under ISR. one of ATF4\u2019s target genes is the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (GADD153) PERK exerts its pro-apoptotic activities via suppressing Bcl2 and ERKs by inducing TRIB3. potential induction of DUSP1 by ATF3 may modulate phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. translation attenuation due to eIF2 activation can also lead to reduced inhibition of IB on NF-B. Activation of PERK has been observed in cells infected with various DNA and RNA viruses. similar to PKR, viruses have adopted counter measures to inhibit PERK-mediated translation attenuation. MHV infection induces translation repression of most cellular proteins. translation of mRNAs seems to be resistant to eIF2 phosphorylation. the detailed mechanisms for such evasion are yet to be investigated. coronaviruses employ multiple mechanisms to antagonize the IFN response. for example, the nsp16 has been shown to utilize the 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity to modify coronavirus mRNAs. the activities of several IFN-induced genes have also been shown to be modulated by coronaviruses during infection. the PERK/PKR-eIF2-ATF4-GADD153 pathway is activated by some, but not all, coronaviruses. this pathway is activated at an early stage but quickly modulated by feedback de-phosphorylation. the PERK/PKR-eIF2-ATF4-GADD153 most likely plays a pro-apoptotic function during coronavirus infection. polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (polyI:C) activated stress response pathways in dendritic cells. the integrated stress response pathways were activated in dendritic cells. this led to up-regulation of ATF4 and GADD34. NF-B is required for the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and IL-8) and the early expression of IFN- during RNA virus infection. it is intriguing to consider the involvement of ER stress in activating the NF-B pathway during coronavirus infection. a protein phosphatase called dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) was up-regulated in IBV-infected cells and dephosphorylated p38 to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production. ER stress-induced DUSP1 up-regulation is likely to be mediated by ATF3 in the PERK pathway. IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. in response to unfolded proteins, IRE1 undergoes oligomerization. this results in trans-autophosphorylation of the kinase domain and the activation of IRE1\u2019s RNase domain. IRE1 is also responsible for basal activity of IKK. phosphorylates IB to remove its inhibition on NF-B. activated IRE1 has been shown to recruit TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and induce apoptosis. MHV infection does not inhibit transactivation of unfolded protein response element (UPRE) and ER stress response element promoter by XBP1s. neither infection with SARS-CoV nor overexpression of SARS-CoV S protein induces XBP1 mRNA splicing. IRE1 inhibited IBV-induced XBP1 mRNA splicing. overexpression of wild-type IRE1 enhanced XBP1 mRNA splicing. IRE1-XBP1 pathway is indeed activated in cells infected with IBV. IRE1-DEPENDENT DECAY DURING VIRUS INFECTION. IRE1 mediates non-specific cleavage of membrane-associated mRNA species. RIDD specifically degraded known target mRNA transcripts but not JEV RNAs. IRE1-XBP1 pathway is specifically activated by TLR4 and TLR2 in murine macrophages. ER stress and TLR activation synergistically activate IRE1 and induce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6. IRE1-XBP1 pathway is required for IL-8 induction in cells infected with IBV. IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. ire1 undergoes oligomerization and activation of IRE1\u2019s RNase domain. IRE1 cuts the XBP1 mRNA twice, removing a 26-nucleotide intron. IRE1 is also responsible for basal activity of IKK to remove its inhibition on NF-B. activated IRE1 has been shown to recruit TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and induce apoptosis by activating the JNK. MHV infection does not inhibit transactivation of unfolded protein response element (UPRE) and ER stress response element (ERSE) promoter by XBP1s. MHV infection is associated with persistent eIF2 phosphorylation and host translational repression. IRE1 inhibited IBV-induced XBP1 mRNA splicing. overexpression of wild-type IRE1 enhanced XBP1 mRNA splicing. IRE1-XBP1 pathway is indeed activated in cells infected with IBV. XBP1 splicing and induction of UPR genes increase in absence of E protein. also suppresses ER stress induced by RSV and drugs. IRE1-DEPENDENT DECAY DURING VIRUS INFECTION Notably, one recent study has demonstrated an alternative function of IRE1. IRE1-XBP1 pathway is specifically activated by TLR4 and TLR2 in murine macrophages. ER stress and TLR activation synergistically activate IRE1 and induce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6. IRE1-XBP1 pathway is also involved in IFN- and pro-inflammatory cytokines production in murine DCs induced by polyI:C. ER stress sensor ATF6 has an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane segment and an ER luminal domain that sense the presence of unfolded/misfolded proteins. the cleavage releases the cytosolic basic leucine zipper domain, which translocates into the nucleus and activates genes harboring the ERSE or ERSE II. west Nile virus (WNV), and HCV (Ambrose and Mackenzie, 2011; Merquiol et al., 2011; Merquiol et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2013). for WNV, it has been shown that ATF6 activation promotes efficient WNV replication by suppressing signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation. authors conclude that global translation shutdown via eIF2 phosphorylation prevents accumulation of ATF6 and activation of ATF6 target genes. overexpression of SARS-CoV spike protein fails to activate ATF6 reporter constructs. accessory protein 8ab of SARS-CoV has been identified to induce ATF6 activation. ire1 pathway induces XBP1 mRNA splicing and expression of downstream UPR genes. ire1 but not XBP1 is also shown to modulate the JNK and Akt kinase activities, thus protecting infected cells from virus induced apoptosis. studies on ER stress and UPR induction during infection with coronaviruses and other viruses are difficult to separate the translation shutdown effect mediated by PERK and the other two ER stress sensors. however, there are scientific and clinical significance for studies on ER stress and UPR induction during infection."}
