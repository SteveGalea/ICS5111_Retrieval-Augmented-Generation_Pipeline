{"summary": "the etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections is difficult. it is necessary to use multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay tests in a routine setting for exact and fast identification. 71 (83%) were positive for one or multiple viruses or bacteria. in developing countries, the incidence of pneumonia among children under 5 years of age is 0.29 episodes per child/year, compared to 0.05 episodes per child/year in developed countries. etiology of pneumonia vary from country to country and from region to region. at least 26 viruses have now been associated with pneumonia. study included 86 infants admitted with respiratory distress isolated or associated with systemic signs. inclusion criteria were based on diagnosis by clinical symptoms. infants were recruited if they presented with symptoms associated with the WHO's definition of clinical pneumonia. TS samples were eluted in 40 l of elution buffer. they were analyzed according to manufacturer's instructions by using the SMART 22 FAST. the assay can detect 22 respiratory pathogens simultaneously. the protocol of the study was approved by the ethics committee of the biomedical research of the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy in Rabat, Morocco. we included in this prospective study 86 infants admitted with respiratory distress isolated or associated with systemic signs. infants were recruited if they presented with symptoms associated with the WHO's definition of clinical pneumonia. ation probe was introduced until resistance was encountered and retracted by approximately 2 cm. this was followed by the release of the vacuum, and the probe was delicately removed using turning movements. the assay can detect and differentiate simultaneously 22 respiratory pathogens. 86 infants presented with respiratory symptoms and suspicion of pneumonia. 46 (53%) were male and 40 (47%) were female, and the sex ratio was 1.15. 54% of the patients were of middle socioeconomic status, 45% had low socioeconomic status, while only one of them was of a high socioeconomic status. 0 0.5 Congenital heart disease 1 (1) 1 (100) 0 0.8 Environment of the patient Smokers at home 4 (5) 3 (75) 1 (25) 0.5 Home conditions Airy and sunny habitat 42 (49) 36 (85.7) 6 (14.3) 0.3 Humidity 44 (51) 35 (79.5) 9 (20.5) All patients included in this study were conscious and had at least one respiratory symptom with a high frequency of dyspnea, representing 95% of the cases.
