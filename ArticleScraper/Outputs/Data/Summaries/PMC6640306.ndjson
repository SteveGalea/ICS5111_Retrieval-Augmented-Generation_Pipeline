{"summary": "inflammatory response in pneumococcal infection is driven by immunoreactive bacterial cell wall components. non-lytic rifampicin compared with lytic -lactam antibiotic treatment would attenuate the inflammatory response in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. host inflammatory response in pneumococcal disease contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. inflammatory response in pneumococcal infection is driven by immunoreactive bacterial cell wall components (lipoteichoic acid) or release of intracellular proteins. non-lytic antibiotic such as rifampicin causes much less inflammation. in vitro studies have shown that rifampicin results in less release of LTA and pro-inflammatory compounds from Streptococcus pneumoniae than the -lactam antibiotics ceftriaxone. the trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NTR3751. inclusion criteria were: 18 years of age, hospital admission for community-acquired pneumonia and moderate to severe disease. the control group was treated with a -lactam antibiotic (without rifampicin) in severe community-acquired pneumonia (CURB-65 score >2) or in patients with risk factors for Legionella pneumonia, ciprofloxacin is added to the empirical treatment (of patients in either group) to cover Legionella infection. Pneumococcal infection was defined as positive sputum or blood culture with S. pneumoniae or a positive BinaxNOW or IMIA at inclusion. at inclusion, at 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 h, and at 30 days after inclusion blood was collected in PAXgene RNA tubes. secondary outcome variables were LTA-mediated inflammatory response, clinical response, MLPA results and inflammatory biomarkers. tate Emission technology (Brahms Kryptor\u00ae, Hennigsdorf, Germany, catalogue number 82591/82592/825050 for PCT and 82991/82992/829050 for MR-proADM) a difference in biomarkers was defined as a change of value in the first and second 24 h after the start of treatment. the marker with the highest VIP score is the best discriminator. linear mixed model (LMM) used results from first 48 h of sampling. compared changes within the first and second 24 h after treatment with a Student\u2019s t-test. the intervention group was treated with 600 mg of rifampicin q12h intravenously for 48 h, in combination with a -lactam antibiotic. ciprofloxacin is added to the empirical treatment (of patients in either group) to cover Legionella infection. vescence was defined by body temperature 37.5\u00b0C during two consecutive measurements at least 8 h apart. the prescription of antipyretics was not part of the study protocol. the decision to discharge a patient was left to the attending physician. biomarker assessment The biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and midregional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) were used to define inflammatory responses. blood sampling and biomarker assessment stopped. the marker with the highest VIP score is the best discriminator. rifampicin was added to the standard antibiotic treatment of patients with acute community-acquired pneumonia. the median age of the total cohort was 69 years, 58% were male and the median CURB-65 score was 2 (Table 1).

RNA expression profiling of 80 transcripts was performed at inclusion. nine patients with pneumococcal pneumonia with rifampicin clustered together. gene expression data do not reveal clear patterns associated with treatment or disease status. the strengths of our study are the high percentage of pneumococcal infections included, the frequent sequential measurement of a spectrum of biomarkers in the first 48 h to assess our hypothesis. a weakness of our pilot trial is the small sample size; this is in line with exploratory character of our study. we included more patients with rifampicin added to -lactam treatment than -lactam treatment only. this assumption was imperfect and the small group hindered comparisons. we could not detect LTA in plasma nor its direct inflammatory response via TLR2. serotype 23F caused more LTA release and inflammation than pneumococcal serotype 3.34. only one patient had a pneumococcal pneumonia with serotype 23F versus four patients with serotype 3. it is not possible to puncture the infected lung lobe for repeated measurements. studies in adults with severe disease have shown a reduction in mortality. corticosteroid therapy increased the risk of hyperglycemia. alternative therapeutic options should be explored to attenuate inflammation. rifampicin was frequently (56%) given before -lactam treatment. but with a median time frame of 5 min only (IQR = 10 to 60 min) the antimicrobial killing of S. pneumonia in both groups might be primarily caused by the -lactam (lytic) killing effect. contributions All authors participated in the design of the study and contributed to manuscript development. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
