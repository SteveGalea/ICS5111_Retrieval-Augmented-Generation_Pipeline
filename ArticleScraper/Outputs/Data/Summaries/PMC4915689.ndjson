{"summary": "mechanistic studies of persistently replicating viral infections have provided numerous insights into immune mechanisms of viral persistence. a paradigm has emerged that viral persistence is linked to defective or tolerant adaptive immune responses. type I IFN receptor expression on dendritic cells (DCs) was necessary for CW3 clearance. adaptive immune response generated in mice with IFNAR deficient DCs was of increased magnitude. CW3 persistence in this model represents an example of viral persistence due to innate rather than adaptive immune deficiency. Ifnar1 flox/flox x LysM-cre, Ifnar1 flox/flox x CD11c-cre, and Ifnar1 flox/flox x villin-cre crosses were tested for the ability to clear CW3 infection. data is combined from at least two experiments with a total of 5\u201311 mice per group. CW3 persistence in myeloid cells prevents systemic persistence. the persistence of MNoV strain CR6 is specifically localized to the intestine and MLN. CW3 spreads systemically but does not persist. CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice and littermate controls (A) or IRF3x7 -/- mice (B) were inoculated with CW3. tissue from IRF3x7 -/- mice (B) were collected on day 21 only. for the macrophage chemokine CCL5 were unchanged in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice. increased type I IFN-stimulated genes are similar or increased in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice. spleens were collected on days three for quantification of indicated interferon stimulated genes by qPCR. DCs have increased activation markers in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice. NK cells express low levels of CD11c and may have altered expression of IFNAR1 in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice. NK cell numbers were unchanged; NK cell expression of KLRG1 and Ly6C was not changed. expression of CD62L was modestly increased in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice. CW3 persistence in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- is associated with enhanced humoral immunity. CW3 persistence in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice is associated with enhanced humoral immunity. serum IgG was incubated with CW3 and the neutralization of viral infection was determined by plaque assay. a greater proportion of CD8 T cells in spleens of CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice responded by expressing IFN (1.7-fold), TNF (1.3-fold) or the degranulation marker CD107a (1.3-fold) there was no significant difference in number of simultaneous functions (IFN production, TNF production, or degranulation) per cell. the percentage of CW3-tetramer positive CD8 T cells was determined by flow cytometry from the indicated tissue. at day 21 there was an increased proportion (8-fold) of CD8 T cells in spleens of CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice compared to control mice. there was no difference in the number of simultaneous functions per cell following peptide restimulation. we quantified in vivo transcripts for IFN, TNF, and Granzyme B. CW3-specific CD8 T cells in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice are functional during persistent CW3 infection. littermate controls (blue lines) were analyzed for cell surface expression of total CD8+ T cells. data in (E) is representative of two independent experiments. data in (A-D) is combined from two (C) or three (A, B, D) experiments. CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice were infected with CW3 (filled gray histograms) or CW3 engineered to express the SIINFELK peptide (Red-lined histograms) splenocytes were isolated and stained with an antibody that recognizes H2-Kb with SIINFEKL bound in the peptide-binding groove. a portion of the MNoV VP1 gene was amplified by PCR from spleen tissue. the region encoding the immunodominant CD8 T cell epitope is representative of sequencing results from four mice. 107 splenocytes were injected into Rag -/- mice that had been infected with CW3 21 days prior. c-Ifnar1 -/- or littermate control mice were infected with CW3. genomes were detected by qPCR in spleens and ileums from Rag1 -/- mice. splenocytes from either donor were similarly able to clear PFUs from the spleen and ileum. mixed bone marrow chimeras were generated by reconstitution of irradiated CD45.1 recipients with 50% wild-type CD45.2 bone marrow and 50% wild-type CD45.1 bone marrow (labeled control) six weeks after reconstitution, mixed bone marrow chimeras were inoculated with CW3. early shedding of viral genomes in the feces of 50% CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- bone marrow chimeras on days five and seven was increased 37-fold and 10-fold respectively compared to control chimeras. mixed wild-type leukocytes are not sufficient to enable early viral control. the presence of mixed wild-type DCs does not rescue control of persistent viral replication. this suggests that the presence of a subpopulation of cells with increased susceptibility to CW3 infection is sufficient. mice were inoculated with CW3 and viral genomes were quantified in the MLN. n.s = p>0.05, * = p0.05, ** = p0.01, *** = p0.001, **** = p0.0001. ifnar1 -/- mice succumb to CW3 infection within seven days. CW3 was sporadically detected in the ileum and colon of CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice after day 21. CW3 persisted in the spleen and MLN but not in the colon of Irf3x7 -/- mice. type I IFN response in myeloid cells prevents systemic persistence. CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice and littermate controls (A) or IRF3x7 -/- mice (B) were inoculated with CW3. tissue from IRF3x7 -/- mice (B) were collected on day 21 only. mulated genes and chemokines are similar or increased in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice. increased type I IFN stimulated genes in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice. spleens were collected on days three for quantification of indicated interferon stimulated genes. DCs (CD3-negative, CD19-negative, CD11c-positive, MHCII-positive) from CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice and littermate controls (cre-negative) 3 days after innoculation with CW3 were quantified (A) and stained for surface markers (B) CW3 persistence in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice is associated with enhanced humoral immunity. a modest reduction in IFNAR1 expression on NK cells does not alter their recruitment or substantially change their activation following CW3 infection. mice and littermate controls 14, 21, and 35 days after infection with CW3. binding of serum IgG to plate-bound virons or NS1 protein was determined by plaque assay (B) data is combined from two experiments with a total of five to eight mice. a greater proportion of CD8 T cells in spleens of CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice responded by expressing IFN (1.7-fold), TNF (1.3-fold), or the degranulation marker CD107a (1.3-fold) there was no significant difference in number of simultaneous functions (IFN production, TNF production, or degranulation) per cell. CW3-specific CD8 T cells are functional during persistent infection. at day 21 there was an increased proportion (8-fold) of CD8 T cells in spleens of CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice compared to control mice. CW3-specific CD8 T cells in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice are functional during persistent CW3 infection. there was no difference in expression of these cell surface proteins on CW3-specific CD8 T cells from CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice in comparison to cre-negative littermate controls. data in (E) is representative of two independent experiments. data in (A-D) is combined from two (C) or three (A, B, D) experiments with individual mice shown in (A-C) and 13 mice per data point in (D) CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- mice were infected with CW3 (filled gray histograms) or CW3 engineered to express the SIINFELK peptide (Red-lined histograms) splenocytes were isolated and stained with an antibody that recognizes H2-Kb with SIINFEKL bound in the peptide-binding groove. a portion of the MNoV VP1 gene was amplified by PCR from spleen tissue 21 days after inoculation. 107 splenocytes were injected into Rag -/- mice that had been infected with CW3 21 days prior. spleens and Ileums were collected from Rag -/- seven days after splenocyte transfer. genomes were detected by qPCR in spleens and ileums from Rag1 -/- and viral titers were determined mice by plaque assay. splenocytes from either CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- or littermate control donors were similarly able to clear PFUs from the spleen and ileum. mixed bone marrow chimeras were generated by reconstitution of irradiated CD45.1 recipients with 50% wild-type CD45.2 bone marrow and 50% wild-type CD45.1 bone marrow (labeled control) or 50% CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- (CD45.2) bone marrow and 50% wild-type CD45.1 bone marrow (labeled control) eces of 50% CD11c-Ifnar1 -/- bone marrow chimeras on days five and seven increased 37-fold and 10-fold respectively compared to control chimeras. mixed wild-type leukocytes are not sufficient to enable early viral control. selective deficiency in the type I IFN response in DCs results in MNoV persistence. previous studies utilizing the LCMV model causally link diminished CD8 T cell functionality to viral persistence. antigen abundance positively correlated with the degree of CD8 T cell dysfunction. mice have small increases in viral replication but are able to clear the infection. the relatively greater effect of IFNAR in myeloid cells is likely due to the preferential replication of CW3 in myeloid cells and/or low IFNAR expression on intestinal epithelial cells. innate immunity is relatively effective at control of type I IFN deficiency. response depends on the level of type I IFN deficiency. a small magnitude of adaptive immune response is sufficient to clear infection. all mice were bred on C57BL/6 background. Cre-negative littermates from Ifnar1 flox/flox x villin-cre, Ifnar1 flox/flox x LysM-cre and Ifnar1 flox/flox x CD11c-cre were used as controls.
