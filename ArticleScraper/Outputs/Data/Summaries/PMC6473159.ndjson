{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the genus Flavivirus within the Flaviviridae family. it is an enveloped positive sense single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of 10.7 kb. it encodes a single polyprotein, which is post-translationally processed by cellular and viral proteases into three structural proteins. most people (7580%) infected with ZIKV are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms such as fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. people with symptoms may have neurological Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome complications. arbidol (ARB) (Fink et al., 2018; Haviernik et al., 2018), bortezomib, mycophenolic acid, daptomycin (Barrows et al., 2016), obatoclax, saliphenylhalamide, gemcitabine (Kuivanen et al., 2017), emetine (Yang et al., 2018), and sofos antivirals have been shown to have inhibitory properties against several bacteria and viruses. ATA has the ability to modulate various cellular enzymes. ATA has the ability to modulate various cellular enzymes. ATA has a potent and effective antiviral activity against ZIKV in pre- and post-infection settings. results demonstrate that ATA has a potent and effective antiviral activity against strains of the African and American/Asian lineages. Compounds Aurintricarboxylic acid (Catalog No. A1895) and Arbidol (ARB, Catalog No. SLM0860) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, MO, United States. each drug was diluted into infectious media (DMEM 2% FBS, 1% PSG) for the described experiments. fluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with 25 plaque forming units (PFU)/well of paraiba/2015, Uganda/1947, Nigeria/1968, Puerto Rico/2015, and French Polynesia/2013 ZIKV strains. after 1 h of adsorption, virus inoculum was removed and cells were washed three times with infection media before adding fresh infection media containing 1% microcrystalline cellulose. tained plaques were analyzed using the CTL ImmunoSpot plate reader and counting software (Cellular Technology Limited, Cleveland, OH, United States) titers were calculated as PFU/ml (Nogales et al., 2015) data are expressed as the mean standard deviation (SD) of at least three independent experiments in triplicates using Microsoft Excel software. value were considered statistically significant when p 0.0332, p 0.0021, p 0.0002, p 0.0001. bacterial stocks were propagated in Vero cells and titrated by plaque assay. compounds Aurintricarboxylic acid (Catalog No. A1895) and Arbidol (ARB, Catalog No. SLM0860) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, MO, United States. non-linear regression curves and the median cytotoxic concentration (CC50) were calculated using GraphPad Prism software version 8.0. cells were infected with 25 plaque forming units (PFU)/well of Paraiba/2015, Uganda/1947, Nigeria/1968, Puerto Rico/2015, and French Polynesia/2013 ZIKV strains. after 1 h of adsorption, virus inoculum was removed. Virus titers were calculated as PFU/ml (Nogales et al., 2015). apoptosis levels were measured using the Caspase-Glo\u00ae 3/7 Assay (Promega, WI, United States) l was measured using a plate shaker, incubated at room temperature for 1 h. luminescence at 570 nm was measured using a SpectraMax iD5. data are expressed as the mean standard deviation (SD) of at least three independent experiments in triplicates using Microsoft Excel software. CC50 values of 74.71 1.09 or 59.37 1.10 M in Vero (Figure 2C) and 114.6 1.08 or 91.0 1.08 M in A549 (Figure 2D) cells were treated with the indicated doses (twofolds dilutions, starting concentration 1,000 M) of ATA (A,B) or ARB (C,D) the IC50 of ATA (Figure 3A) and ARB (Figure 3C) in Vero cells were similar (13.87 1.09 M and 18.19 1.6 M, respectively), the selective index (SI, CC50/IC50) of ATA (>72.10) was significantly higher than that of ARB (4.11). 549 cells were similar but with clearly different SI values. notably the CC50, IC50, and SI of ARB were similar to those previously described in the literature in these cell lines. ATA exhibited an effective inhibition of ZIKV infection with limited toxicity and SI values better than those previously described. tissue culture supernatants were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h p.i., and viral titer were calculated by immunostaining (fluorescent forming units, FFU/ml) data was expressed as mean and standard deviations from three independent experiments conducted in triplicates. -infected cells showed increased caspase 3 and 7 levels up to eightfolds in vero cells and up to 4.2-folds in A549 cells compared to mock-infected cells. levels of caspase 3 and 7 activation were dose-dependently reduced by ATA with 250 M of ATA showed only 0.4- and 1.7-fold induction. we observed similar IC50 values of ATA with Uganda/1947 (Figure 6A, IC50 = 15.07 1.19 M), Nigeria/1968 (Figure 6B, IC50 = 15.97 1.02 M), and Puerto Rico/2015 (Figure 6C, IC50 = 17.55 1.16 M), compared to those observed with Paraiba/2015 (Figure 3 and Table 1). ATA inhibits different ZIKV strains regardless of the year and place of isolation. Vero cells were pre-treated with ATA for 12 (Figure 7A), 24 (Figure 7B), 48 (Figure 7C), or 72 (Figure 7D) h prior to infection (MOI 0.1) with Paraiba/2015. ATA is stable and able to prevent ZIKV infection even when administered 3 days before viral infection. at 36 h p.i., infected cells were fixed for virus titration by immunostaining. we did not observe any toxicity with ATA in vero (Figure 2A) or A549 (Figure 2B) cells at 36 or 72 h post-treatment, even at the highest concentration tested (1,000 M), while ARB showed CC50 values of 74.71 1.09 or 59.37 1.10 M in Vero (Figure 2C) and 114.6 1.08 or 91.0 1.08 M in A549 (Figure 2D) cells. paraiba/2015 ATA Post 36 A549 >1,000 33.33 1.13 >26.26 Paraiba/2015 ARB Post 36 Vero 74.71 1.09 18.19 1.16 4.11 Paraiba/2015 ARB Post 36 A549 114.6 1.08 51.87 1.08 2.21 Uganda/1947 ATA Post 48 Vero >1,000 15.07 1.19 >66.35 Nigeria/1968 ATA Post 60 Vero >1,000 15.97 1.02 >62.62 Puerto Rico/2015 ATA Post 48 Ver IC50 of ATA (Figure 3A) and ARB (Figure 3C) in vero cells were similar (13.87 1.09 M and 18.19 1.6 M respectively) the selective index (SI, CC50/IC50) of ATA (>72.10) was significantly higher than that of ARB (4.11). notably the CC50, IC50, and SI of ARB were similar to those previously described in the literature in these cell lines. vero (Figure 4A) and A549 (Figure 4B) cells were infected (MOI 0.1) with Paraiba/2015. 2.5 M and 25 M concentrations of ATA showed partial viral inhibition. ATA protects cells from the cytopathic effect induced during ZIKV infection. tissue culture supernatants from ZIKV-infected Vero and A549 cells harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h p.i. to measure the level of apoptotic signal as determined by caspase 3 and 7 activities. levels of caspase 3 and 7 activation were dose-dependently reduced by ATA with 250 M of ATA showed only 0.4- and 1.7-fold induction as compared to mock-infected cells. ATA Inhibition of Representative African and Asia/American ZIKV strains. similar IC50 values of ATA with Uganda/1947, Nigeria/1968, and Puerto Rico/2015, compared to those observed with Paraiba/2015. dotted line indicates 50% inhibition. data was expressed as mean and SD from three independent experiments. pre-treatment of ATA Inhibits ZIKV replication. ATA (Figure 1) has limited toxicity (Figure 2) and an effective and dose-dependent antiviral activity against ZIKV infection (Figure 3, 4) in both monkey kidney epithelial epithelial Vero and human alveolar A549 cells. ATA can also prevent ZIKV infection even when administered 3 days before infection. ATA could inhibit the ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5 protein. ATA could inhibit the methyltransferase activity of NS5 involved in mRNA capping processes. ATA targets and has inhibitory activities against one or more of the viral proteins described above. rumence et al., 2016: inhibition of ZIKV replication results in a decrease in the level of apoptotic cells. further research is guaranteed to yield a better understanding of the antiviral activity of ATA on ZIKV infection, and other viruses, before the use of ATA as an antiviral drug. treatment with ATA could be used for the broad prevention of DENV, YFV (Milani et al., 2009; Shadrick et al., 2013; Garcia et al., 2017); and HCV (Chen et al., 2009; Mukherjee et al., 2012; Shadrick et al., 2013); and parasitic infestation (Cryptosporidium parvum) for people traveling to these endemic ATA in pregnant women requires future additional safety tests before using ATA for the treatment of ZIKV infection during pregnancy. ATA represents one of the most reasonable options of the treatment of ZIKV infection. th, AN, FA, and LM-S provided the funds. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
