{"summary": "global diabetes prevalence is forecast to increase to 629 million people by 2045. microvascular complications resulting from hyperglycemia are major clinical sequelae of type 2 diabetes. glycemic control has been shown to reduce risk of kidney disease. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are also one of the newer types of oral glucose-lowering drug licensed for type 2 diabetes. the first-in-class sitagliptin has been approved in 2006 in the united states. linagliptin is the first and so far only such drug to be excreted predominantly by non-renal pathways. linagliptin is a 110-kDa glycoprotein with serine exopeptidase activity. the catalytic activity of DPP-4 removes the N-terminal dipeptide from peptides containing proline or alanine in the second position. DPP-4 is a ubiquitous protein that is present in most organs in a range of different tissues and cell types. it is involved in multiple protein\u2013protein interactions, including association with adenosine deaminase in most tissues and with the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 on T lymphocytes. the enzymatic activity of PP-4 has been shown to cleave a wide variety of biopeptides in in vitro assays. the most well-known of the latter are the peptide hormones glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. the most well-known of the latter are the peptide hormones glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic in rats, membrane-bound DPP-4 expression and enzymatic activity has been demonstrated to occur in several tissue types in healthy organs and under disease conditions. membrane-bound DPP-4 forms a complex with NHE3 in the brush border of renal proximal tubules. membrane-bound DPP-4 forms a complex with NHE3 in the brush border of renal proximal tubules where it appears to modulate NHE3-mediated Na+/H+ exchange to reduce a regression analysis of relationships between stages of chronic kidney disease and serum levels of 10 proteases found that only angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and DPP-4 activities significantly correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); in both cases, the relationship was inverse such that patients with the highest DPP-4 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activities exhibited the lowest eGFR [57]. levels were elevated, linagliptin reduced levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptor (RAGE), as well as reducing albuminuria, lymphocyte infiltration into glomeruli, and 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine levels in the kidney. linagliptin inhibited tubulointerstitial fibrosis in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes characterized by extensive fibrosis. treatment with linagliptin reduced albuminuria without affecting blood glucose levels. Linagliptin also attenuated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the oxidative stress markers NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2 (NOX2) and NOX4 [67]. Renal oxidative stress STZ-diabetic Sprague\u2013Dawley rat Albuminuria Gill et al. (2014) [68] Zucker obese rat Loss of glomerular endothelial fenestrae, podocyte effacement and slit pore diaphragm Nistala et al. linagliptin reduced damage to the glomerular filtration barrier and proteinuria. linagliptin reduced albuminuria and kidney fibrosis in mice with 5/6 nephrectomy. linagliptin also reduced albuminuria and kidney fibrosis. the antifibrotic changes in the kidneys occurred together with inhibition of the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) [64], which is thought to be an important source of kidney fibroblasts [86\u201389] that play a key role in renal fibrosis [90]. linagliptin reduced the expression and enzymatic activity of DPP-4 in the glomerular basement membrane, tubules, and peritubular vascular cells of the kidney linagliptin inhibited TGF-2-induced EndMT in cultured human endothelial cells and reduced TGF-2-induced phosphorylation of Smad3. miR-29a, -b, and -c were suppressed in both diabetic kidneys and cultured endothelial cells but were restored by linagliptin treatment. miR-29 targets the inflammatory cytokine interferon-, which participates in tissue fibrosis by suppressing expression of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and subsequently miR-let-7 as well [97,98]. there is bidirectional cross-talk between miR-29 and miR-let-7s. integrins are transmembrane receptor proteins that play essential roles in cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix by binding to matrix proteins as well as other cell surface receptors. integrin 1 has a diverse involvement in physiological and pathological processes. the interaction between DPP-4 and integrin 1 in endothelial cells also down-regulated expression of the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) but up-regulated the expression of VEGF-R1 [65] this would be expected to tip the balance of VEGF signaling toward EndMT, as VEGF-R1 stimulates EndMT. linagliptin inhibits VEGF-R1 expression. linagliptin inhibits a profibrotic endMT process. linagliptin phosphorylates the endothelial cells. veGF-R2 is more abundant than VEGF-R1, favoring proangiogenic VEGF signaling responses. linagliptin treatment significantly reduced serum levels of TGF-1 in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, mechanistic study in non-diabetic, hypertensive patients. AGE-RAGE pathway, oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial nitric oxide activity Diabetes is associated with increased levels of AGEs, i.e. proteins or lipids that are glycated by the non-enzymatic Maillard reaction. AGEs contribute to development of the macro- and microvascular complications of diabetes, including chronic kidney disease. linagliptin treatment reduced albuminuria and renal hypertrophy in a glucose-independent manner. linagliptin also increased levels of antioxidant enzymes catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase. in mice with reduced antioxidant function, linagliptin also reduced albuminuria and kidney hypertrophy. linagliptin was shown to directly interact with the caveolin-1/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) complex to rescue eNOS activity. linagliptin but not sitagliptin or vildagliptin \u2013 ameliorated endothelial dysfunction induced by high glucose concentrations in vitro. a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled trial of sitagliptin. linagliptin improved kidney fibrosis and albuminuria without altering blood glucose levels. linagliptin is expressed in many non-pancreatic tissues, including the kidney. tic changes in the kidneys occurred together with inhibition of the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) [64], which is thought to be an important source of kidney fibroblasts [86\u201389] that play a key role in renal fibrosis [90] linagliptin reduced the expression and enzymatic activity of DPP-4 as well as the expression of TGF-1 and TGF-2. miR-29a, -b, and -c were suppressed in both diabetic kidneys and cultured endothelial cells but were restored by linagliptin treatment. linagliptin treatment restored levels of miR-29c while suppressing the induction of pro-fibrotic miRs such as miR-199-3p. the miR-let-7 family also has antifibrotic effects in the kidney of diabetic CD-1 mice. there is bidirectional cross-talk between miR-29 and miR-let-7. miR-29 could suppress DPP-4, integrin 1 and interferon-. integrins are transmembrane receptor proteins that play essential roles in cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix. each integrin subunit comprises an extracellular domain involved in binding interactions, a transmembrane portion, and a short cytoplasmic tail that transduces extracellular\u2013intracellular signals. RNAi-mediated knockdown of either integrin 1 or DPP-4 abolished TGF-2-induced TGF- receptor heterodimer formation, Smad3 phosphorylation, and EndMT. the interaction between DPP-4 and integrin 1 in endothelial cells also down-regulated expression of the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) but up-regulated the expression of VEGF-R1 [65]. the antifibrotic effect observed in the recent study is not a class effect but specific for linagliptin. the reasons why the antifibrotic properties of linagliptin may not be shared by other DPP-4 inhibitors are discussed later in this article. linagliptin treatment significantly reduced serum levels of TGF-1 in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, mechanistic study in non-diabetic, hypertensive patients. linagliptin may protect the kidneys via several other pathways, including effects on AGE-RAGE signaling, oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial nitric oxide activity. oxidative stress, endothelial nitric oxide activity Diabetes is associated with increased levels of AGEs, i.e. proteins or lipids that are glycated by the non-enzymatic Maillard reaction as a consequence of their exposure to glucose and other saccharides. linagliptin alone contains a xanthine-based scaffold and can inhibit xanthine oxidase [118], an enzyme of purine metabolism that generates linagliptin also increased levels of antioxidant enzymes catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase. but in mice with reduced antioxidant function resulting from knockout of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, linagliptin neither increased these antioxidant enzymes nor decreased albuminuria or kidney hypertrophy. the antioxidant effects of linagliptin in this model were elicited mainly via its antioxidant properties. non-GLP-1 substrates of DPP-4 SDF-1 promote endothelial repair by mobilizing endothelial progenitor cells from bone marrow. linagliptin up-regulated SDF-1 expression in distal tubules of the kidney. linagliptin also increased plasma SDF-1 levels in rats with obesity-related nephropathy. linagliptin is the only one of the five globally marketed DPP-4 inhibitors to be excreted from the body mainly by non-renal pathways. linagliptin is the only one of the five globally marketed DPP-4 inhibitors to be excreted from the body mainly by non-renal pathways. linagliptin, sitagliptin, and alogliptin are predominantly removed via the kidneys. this necessitates their dose reduction in patients with kidney disease. linagliptin was the only DPP-4 inhibitor whose exposure was not increased by renal impairment. linagliptin normalized the expression of the following key molecular markers of uremic cardiomyopathy. xagliptin 55.0 0.3 9.2 105 2.0 151 24 10 Sitagliptin 45.0 5.3 1.5 107 630 198 75 38 Vildagliptin 95.5 2.4 7.1 104 1.7 70.5 22.6 9 Abbreviations: KD, equilibrium dissociation constant; kon, rate constant for association of the DPP-4/inhibitor complex; koff, rate constant for dissociation of the DPP-4/inhibitor complex binding kinetics of the five globally marketed DPP-4 inhibitors found that linagliptin had the highest binding affinity for DPP-4 (KD = 0.0066 nmol/l), one of the fastest binding rates (kon = 7.6 106 M1.s1) and the slowest dissociation rate (koff = 5.1 105 s1) linagliptin conferred greater vascular protection than sitagliptin despite similar effects on blood glucose levels. linagliptin elicited more sustained inhibition of in situ DPP-4 activity than sitagliptin in the proximal tubule and glomerulus of normal male Wistar rats administered single oral doses of these drugs. linagliptin but not sitagliptin inhibited renal DPP-4 activity in a rat model of renal ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury. there is little clinical data to support the hypothesis that these drugs have pleio linagliptin treatment was associated with a 32% reduction in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in individuals with albuminuria who were already receiving standard of care for diabetic nephropathy. a prospective cohort study found that treatment with sitagliptin was associated with a reduced risk of acute kidney injury in patients with diabetes. a pooled analysis of 13 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials revealed a significant mean reduction in adverse renal events in patients receiving linagliptin [151] linagliptin elicited only a non-significant 6% reduction in UACR [152] in the subsequent 24-week MARLINA-T2DTM clinical trial. linagliptin has demonstrated pleiotropic renoprotective properties in diabetic and non-diabetic animal models of nephropathy. antifibrotic effects mediated via interaction with miR and integrins also likely to play a potentially unique renoprotective role. a large event-driven, placebo-controlled clinical trial is the first study designed and adequately powered to robustly evaluate renal outcomes of treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor. 7000 type 2 diabetes patients with high cardiorenal risk have been enrolled in CARMELINA\u00ae [158] and results are anticipated in 2018."}
