{"summary": "the disease spectrum of EV-D68 infections in children with underlying medical conditions other than asthma have not been described. the role of EV-D68 loads on clinical illness, and the variation of EV-D68 strains within the same institution over time have not been described. EV-D68 was associated with high morbidity in children with asthma and co-morbidities. a large outbreak of EV-D68 associated with severe respiratory illness was identified in the midwestern united states. a large outbreak of EV-D68 associated with respiratory distress was identified in late summer of 2014. patient population and study design nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from patients 21 years of age admitted to nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital. from 2011 to 2013 RV/EV identification was performed using a laboratory developed real time (RT)-PCR assay. in 2014 RV/EV were identified using a multiplex PCR panel (FilmArray Respiratory Panel; BioFire, Salt Lake City, UT) the history of asthma/wheezing and chronic medical conditions were first identified by electronic extraction from patients\u2019 EHR and then verified by manual review. patients with no other comorbidities except for history of asthma or any prior wheezing episodes were included in the asthma/wheezing group. RT-PCR was carried out using the ABI 7500 thermocycler (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with running conditions: 48\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 10 min at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15s and 50\u00b0C for 1 min. the higher the Ct value the lower the amount of genomic EV-D68. the amino acid sequences (including BE and DC loops) of partial VP1 were aligned and compared with NCH strains and selected sequences that were previously published. Statistical analyses were performed using frequency distributions or rates. EV-D68 testing was completed after the patient encounter, thus results were not available to the physician treating the patient. electronic health records (EHR) from all children identified (RV/EV-non-EV-D68 and EV-D68) were reviewed for pertinent demographics, clinical characteristics and outcomes of care including admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) the primer and probe sequences were designed based on in silico analysis of all available EV-D68 sequences deposited in NCBI. 20% of the EV-D68 2014 outbreak sequences were included. total nucleic acid was obtained by extraction using the NucliSENS easyMag platform. cycle sequencing was performed with BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing Kit. multiple sequence alignment was performed and phylogenetic trees were generated using the neighbor-joining method implemented in MEGA version 6.0. support for specific tree topologies was estimated by bootstrap analysis with a value of 1000. four NICU patients excluded because they had been hospitalized already for a prolonged period of time when they tested positive for EV-D68. from May to November 2014 3,540 samples underwent viral testing at NCH department of Pathology. the colored lines represent the convenience sampling, in blue the RV/EV-non-EV-D68 positive samples and in red the positive EV-D68 samples. children with EV-D68 infection were significantly older, with no overall differences in sex or race. history of asthma was as well more common in EV-D68 positive children.
