{"summary": "the study Enhanced surveillance involved the collection of a minimum dataset for each possible case, including demographic data, clinical symptoms, travel and contact history, and results of testing for respiratory pathogens (6). 77 travelers from the Middle East that met the possible case definition were tested for MERS-CoV. 77 people tested ranged in age from 3 months to 90 years. 34 (44%) had signs of pulmonary parenchymal involvement. the 2 confirmed cases were in male patients, 45 and 60 years of age. both had severe acute respiratory symptoms requiring treatment by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. pulmonary parenchymal involvement tested positive for MERS-CoV. 22 of the 77 patients tested had positive results for alternative respiratory pathogens. 1 of the influenza A\u2013infected case-patients was later confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV. this study is based on a cohort of 77 suspected case-patients. only 2 laboratory-confirmed cases were identified during the surveillance period. estimates on the basis of identified symptoms are very imprecise. but reporting such data helps optimize case detection and surveillance systems."}
