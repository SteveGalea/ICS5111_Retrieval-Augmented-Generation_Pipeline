{"summary": "the term \"immunosenescence\" refers to the cell biological concept of \"replicative senescence\" it is often assumed that this term refers to the cell biological concept of \"replicative senescence\" it is not what immunologists generally mean by \"immunosenescence\" this assumption is unlikely to be correct, given the markedly different circumstances of older people born in the early to middle 20th century and young people born towards the end of that century. this assumption is unlikely to be correct, given the markedly different circumstances of older people born in the early to middle 20 th century and young people born towards the end of that century. this assumption is likely to include genetic, nutritional, environmental, psychosocial, and educational factors as well as many others. older adults have vanishingly low numbers and percentages of nave CD8 + T cells in their peripheral blood, as first reported many years ago. however, higher CD8 + memory cells in the elderly are not universally reported. accumulations of late-stage memory cells are seen in older people infected with human herpesvirus 5 but not other herpesviruses 8\u201310. differences between younger and older adults are seen to a lesser extent for CD4 + nave T cells, and for B cells, as well as for some elements of innate immunity. but all immune cells are affected to some degree. the data on immune cell distribution in tissues other than blood in humans are too sparse for any clinical correlates to be established. thymic involution early in life contributes decisively to the very small numbers of nave T cells in the elderly 20. the requirement for maximising immune defence potential is greatest during childhood to prevent death from infection 21. after puberty and reproductive age, exposure to new pathogens is less likely and immunity for local pathogens is paramount. the impact of immunosenescence on influenza vaccination is much more complicated to dissect because of the ever-changing balance of seasonal strains and indeterminate degree of T cell memory. the impact of immunosenescence on influenza vaccination is much more complicated to dissect because of the ever-changing balance of seasonal strains. evidence is emerging that CD8 + memory cells in elderly people may behave in a pathogenic manner to a greater degree than in the young. there is preliminary evidence that CD8 + T cells can behave in a similar manner and contribute to \u201cinflammaging\u201d 29. senescence has to be defined in terms of known detrimental clinical associations. the main differences between younger and older people reside in the different distribution of nave and memory elements of the adaptive immune system. a study by Belsky et al. 38 followed nearly 1,000 young people (26 years of age) in new Zealand for 12 years and measured a panel of biomarkers that they then correlated with relative physical and cognitive performance and appearance. even at the age of only 38, some individuals were biologically more aged than others, and this correlated with clusters of markers including CRP, white blood cell count and leucocyte telomere length. biomarkers of immune ageing as established in cross-sectional studies unequivocally document multiple differences between younger and older populations. some markers distinct to older people can be associated with important health parameters such as frailty and responses to vaccination. however, these factors and especially factors associated with mortality must be viewed in the context of the particular population in which they were established. final version listed with their names and affiliations but without their reports on earlier versions. referees who approved this article are: arne Akbar, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, UK Claudio Franceschi, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy Alan Landay, Rush University, Chicago, IL, USA Rafael Solana, University of cordoba, Cordoba, Spain M\u00f3nica De la Fuente, Complutense University of Madrid"}
