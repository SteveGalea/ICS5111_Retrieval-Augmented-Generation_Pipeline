{"summary": "in vitro diagnostic tests implemented with low-cost, easy-to-operate, portable instruments and miniaturized sample processing/analysis devices can be used outside of medical laboratories for detecting pathogens. pervasive, cheap, and rapid NAATs will foster new paradigms for improved and sustainable medical care (e.g., mobile healthcare using smartphones) molecular assays for DNA and RNA targets offer many advantages over immunoassays. the high sensitivity is due to the million fold amplification of the target sequence. unlike immunoassays which rely on monoclonal antibodies, NAATs utilize nucleic acid oligos for hybridization. molecular diagnostics provide greater sensitivity and selectivity than immunoassays. however, they require more sample preparation, more instrumentation, more labor and expertise, and longer test times. microfluidics POC efforts are to make molecular diagnostics nearly as easy to use as lateral flow strip immunoassays. microarrays offer a high degree of parallel processing for multiplex detection. microarrays can streamline and automate the serial sample processing steps. a 10- to 100-fold concentration of target for amplification is often needed. standardized microfluidic devices can be useful for rapid sample preparation and screening of samples where labile targets may suffer degradation (especially mRNAs) or low yield (e.g., microRNAs), quality control of reagents, detecting the presence of inhibitor substances and other interfering components. microarrays can be used to design amplification primers and probes for microfluidics-based NAATs. s, enzymes, chaotropic agents promote preferential binding of nucleic acids to silica glass or cellulose fibers of the porous membrane. the membrane is then washed with ethanol:water salt solutions to remove proteins and other debris. the captured NA is then desorbed and eluted from the membrane with water. luciferase/luciferin can be used for amplification such as changes in pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity, phosphate or ATP concentration. the labile reagents (polymerases, reverse transcriptases, proteases for lysis) need to be maintained in a cold chain, and the laboratory work area and procedures must minimize cross contamination of samples. the chip performs multi tasks to simplify its design, operation, and flow control and to reduce its cost. the chip performs multi tasks to simplify its design, operation, and flow control and to reduce its cost. lyophilized reagents reduces flow control operations, thereby simplifying the chip. reagents are released only once the reactor has reached its operating temperature. the method provides a \u201chot start\u201d to amplification in that reagents are released only once the reactor has reached its operating temperature. 5 chamber is heated to amplification temperature (65 \u00b0C), melting paraffin encapsulation layer and reconstituting lyophilized enzymes, reagents, and DNA intercalating fluorescent dye. chip was inserted into a portable palm-sized instrument with a heated stage and mounting fixture. consists of an amplification-diffusion conduit (ADC) which provides a spatial indication of the concentration of target nucleic acids in the sample. the amplification process runs its course (i.e., saturates) after a short time from the beginning, the reaction-diffusion conduit can be viewed as consisting of two regions. the magnitude of X0 depends on the concentration of the target nucleic acid in the sample. the greater the concentration of target molecules in the sample, the larger is XF. the reaction front velocity depends on the rate of the amplification reaction. cellphone Detection of on-Chip Fluorescence Microfluidic devices can leverage smartphone technology to image the chip and detect the increasing level of fluorescence due to the amplification process [39,40,41,42] a blue LED (@ 20 mA current) excites the DNA-binding fluorophore, and the longer-wavelength fluorescence is detected by the CCD camera after optically filtering out the excitation light. the temperature is regulated with a phase change material (PCM, e.g., paraffin) that acts as a ballast to maintain the reaction chambers at the PCM melting temperature. prevailing standards for viral loads are based on virus counts in plasma rather than in whole blood. 1.8 mL of whole blood loaded into this device yielded nearly 300 L of plasma in 7 min. in a newer version of the device, we have nearly tripled the yield. an assay for heme in the extract indicated negligible lysis of red blood cells. design and rapid prototyping of components within a timeframe of one to two days is feasible. a middle layer is patterned with the fluidic circuit by a CNC milling machinine, a desktop engraver, or a CO2 laser cutter. a commercial temperature controller or microntroller can be used to regulate the temperature. embedded membrane for capture of DNA and RNA, storage of reagents, and in situ amplification of NA on the membrane. amplification isothermal (constant temperature) amplification such as LAMP (Loop mediated amplification) with real-time detection. hybrid sedimentation-filtration plasma extraction device can replace centrifugation enabling plasma separation from whole blood specimens at the point of care. we use a solid-phase extraction for NA isolation based on the common chaotrope-silica method used in commercial spin columns. Related NA isolation methods based on ChargeSwitch\u00ae Technology (CST) and solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) are also potential alternatives."}
