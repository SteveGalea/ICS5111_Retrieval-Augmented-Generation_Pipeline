{"summary": "studies carried out on herpesviruses demonstrated that viral capsids contain significant amounts of polyamines that putatively neutralize charges on the viral DNA. chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), important pathogens responsible for serious outbreaks, rely on polyamines for both translation and transcription. cell counts and viability were measured on uninfected cells treated with DFMO for 5 days. cells were infected with Sindbis virus (SINV) at the indicated times (I) and treated with the indicated DFMO doses for 24 h. a recent perspective (13) highlights the importance of developing broad-spectrum antivirals. a nucleoside analog developed in 1972, is used successfully in the treatment of several viral diseases, including hemorrhagic fevers (14). ideally, these drugs would inhibit multiple viruses, possibly by targeting a host pathway that multiple viruses commandeer. DFMO (Tebu Bio and Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted to 50 mM in water. individual polyamines (Sigma-Aldrich) were supplied at 1,000 concentration and used at 5 concentration during treatment. cells were reseeded with medium supplemented with 2% serum. CVB3 (Nancy strain) was derived from the first passage in HeLa cells. dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV1; KDH0026A strain) and Zika virus (ZIKV; HD78788 strain) were derived from the third passage of virus in C6/36 cells. infected cells were freeze-thawed twice at 24 hpi and scraped prior to titration. supernatants were prepared in serum-free DMEM and used to inoculate monolayers of vero-E6 cells for 30 min to 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were then overlaid with 0.8% agarose in DMEM containing 1.6% newborn calf serum. dilutions were prepared in gel saline (PBS containing 0.3% [wt/vol] gelatin) cells were then overlaid with DMEM containing 1% agarose. after 72 h of incubation, plaques were enumerated and used to calculate the number of PFU/ml. the carboxymethylcellulose overlay was aspirated, and the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. after fixation, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-E antibody (4G2) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. cultures were treated with 25-g/ml uridine and 10-g/ml fluorodeoxyuridine. cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in 9% CO2. DFMO, combined or not with polyamines, was added on day 1. l of 150-mg/ml proline (Sigma-Aldrich) was extracted with 100 l of toluene (Sigma-Aldrich) five microliters of each sample was added in small spots to the TLC plate (silica gel matrix; Sigma-Aldrich) the plate was dried and visualized via exposure to ascending chromatography with 2:3 cyclohexame/ethylacetate. mice were infected intraperitoneally with 2,000 TCID50 in 0.25 ml. at 3 days postinfection, organs were harvested and weighed. a precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, Bretonneux, France) was used to grind tissues. individual polyamines (Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted to 1 M in water and used at 10 M. five days prior to infection, cells were trypsinized and reseeded with medium supplemented with 2% serum. cells were reseeded with medium supplemented with 2% serum. otype 1 (DENV1; KDH0026A strain) and Zika virus (ZIKV; HD78788 strain) were derived from third passage of virus in C6/36 cells. Poliovirus type 1 (PV-1; Sabin type 1 strain) was produced from Hep2C cells. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71; SEP06 strain) was derived from Vero-E6 cells. cells were fixed with 4% formalin and revealed with crystal violet solution (10% crystal violet [Sigma-Aldrich], 20% ethanol) supernatants used to determine viral titers via 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) yellow fever virus (YFV) infection performed as described above in cells at an MOI of 0.01. plaques were enumerated and used to calculate number of focus-forming units (FFU) per milliliter of collected volume. cells were stained by mouse pan-flavivirus anti-E antibody (4G2; RD-Biotech) and foci revealed by goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate. ted for 1 h at room temperature with anti-E antibody (4G2) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. the assays were developed according to the manufacturer's instructions. the plates were scanned with an ArrayScan reader, and nucleocapsid-positive inclusions were automatically quantified in at least 1,500 neurons per condition. calculation of the effect of DFMO was done by dividing the titers obtained without DFMO treatment by the titers obtained with DFMO treatment. a serum sample obtained from a patient during the 2013 Caribbean chikungunya virus outbreak was added to C6/36 cells and passaged twice to generate a viral stock. the titer of the viral stock was determined as described above. the cells were split into 6-well dishes 1 day prior to infection. mice were injected subcutaneously with 105 PFU in the hind leg near the ankle. tissues were harvested at 24 hpi. titers were expressed as PFU per mg of tissue. ya virus (CHIKV) previously (4), exogenous polyamine addition rescued the viral titers to nearly the levels in untreated cells. in a similar vein, vero-E6 cells were treated with escalating doses of DFMO, from 10 to 5,000 M, and infected as described above. a similar vein, we observed a dose-response inhibition of CVB3 replication. BHK-21 cells were pretreated with 500 M DFMO and infected at an MOI of 0.1. similar to CHIKV, we observed a dose-dependent reduction in viral titers with escalating doses of DFMO after 24 h of infection. a cell type Chikungunya virusb Togaviridae Alphavirus + Yes No 200** BHK-21 8* Murine fibroblasts 12** Vero 12** Human fibroblasts 28* C6/36 Sindbis virus Togaviridae Alphavirus + Yes No 10*** BHK-21 MERS coronavirus Coronaviridae Coronaviridae + Yes No 30*** Vero Dengue virus, serotype 1 Flaviviridae Flavivirus + titers were determined following a 4-day DFMO treatment and rescue with exogenous polyamines. n = 3 replicated for all viruses except DENV (n = 8), ZIKV (n = 9), MERS (n = 6), and RABV. bars and error bars represent mean results 1 standard deviation. DENSpm inhibits RNA virus replication. another mechanism to deplete cells of polyamines is through the activation of SAT1 via DENSpm. Vero-E6 cells were treated with 10 M DENSpm for 16 h. they were treated with escalating doses of DENSpm for 16 h prior to infection with CVB3 at an MOI of 0.1 (C), VSV at an MOI of 0.01 (D), or CHIKV at an MOI of 0.1 (E) DFMO and beta interferon can reduce viral replication to differing degrees. chikV titers were synergistically reduced, suggesting DFMO combined with IFN- may be a successful treatment for select viruses. combination of IFN-, a commonly administered antiviral, with either polyamine-depleting agent may not significantly affect viral replication compared to single treatment. SAT1 rapidly depletes polyamines from cells (20), and thus, DENSpm may serve to limit the spread of viral infection more effectively than DFMO-mediated polyamine depletion. polyamine depletion limits viral replication in a time-dependent manner. cells were treated with 10 M DENSpm at the indicated times prior to and after infection with CVB3 at an MOI of 0.1 (A) and VSV at an MOI of 0.01 (B) for 24 h. polyamine depletion limits viral replication in mammalian models. DFMO treatment at the time of infection reduced viral spread. in all cases, DFMO treatment at the time of infection reduced viral spread. mice were provided 1% DFMO in drinking water ad libitum for 7 days prior to infection with 1,000 TCID50 of CVB3 intraperitoneally. at 3 dpi, viral titers in the spleen (A), pancreas (B), heart (C), lung (D), liver (E), and kidney (F) were determined by plaque assay. DFMO pretreated vero-E6 cells with 500 M DFMO for 4 days prior to infection with CVB3 at an MOI of 0.1. we measured titers by plaque assay and found a significant reduction in viral titers in DFMO-treated cells compared to the titers in untreated cells. BHK-21 cells were treated with DFMO and infected with VSV for 16 h. the biogenic polyamines were able to rescue viral titers. these results implicate polyamines in the replication of diverse viruses. the viruses tested were MERS-coronavirus (MERS-coronavirus), flaviviruses dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV1), enteroviruses enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and poliovirus (PV), bunyavirus Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and rhabdovirus rabies virus (RABV) no 12* HeLa Coxsackievirus B3 Picornaviridae Enterovirus + No No 10* HeLa Poliovirus Picornaviridae Enterovirus + No No 20* HeLa Rift Valley fever virus Bunyaviridae Phlebovirus Yes Yes 200*** BHK-21 Vesicular stomatitis virus Rhabdoviridae Lyssavirus Yes No 2*** Cortical neurons a Calculated by dividing tit chikungunya virus (CHIKV) at 24 hpi in BHK-21 cells. rabies virus (RABV) at 24 hpi in primary cortical neurons. n = 3 replicates for all viruses except DENV (n = 8), ZIKV (n = 9), MERS (n = 6), and RABV (n = 6). over a time course of infection, the viral titers were determined via plaque assay. for both viruses, we observed a significant reduction in viral titers at all time points examined. this suggests that these viruses are sensitive in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis of SAT1 and GAPDH (top two panels) and thin-layer chromatographic analysis of polyamines were performed on uninfected samples run, measured at 40 h posttreatment. error bars represent 1 standard error of the mean. polyamine depletion blocks viral replication in combination with IFN-. vero-E6 cells were not treated or treated with 10 M DENSpm for 16 h and 1,000 U IFN- for 4 h prior to infection with the same viruses. the combination of IFN-, a commonly administered antiviral, with either polyamine-depleting agent may not significantly affect viral replication compared to single treatment. we observed that CVB3 titers were reduced when DENSpm was added as late as 4 hpi. however, the greatest effect on viral replication was achieved when cells were pretreated with DENSpm 4 to 16 h prior to infection. even treatment with DENSpm at the time of infection failed to affect viral titers. plaques were developed after 4 days (H), 3 days (E, G, and I), or 2 days (F). Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test (n 3). Error bars represent 1 standard error of the mean. mice were given 1% DFMO in drinking water ad libitum for 7 days prior to infection with 1,000 TCID50 of CVB3 intraperitoneally. after 3 days, organs were harvested and homogenized, and the viral titers were determined via plaque assay. in the primary target organs of the spleen, pancreas, and heart, we observe slight, statistically insignificant changes in viral titers. the titers in the tissues analyzed were lower in DFMO-treated mice than in the controls. this suggests that polyamine depletion in vivo has the potential to reduce viral replication. however, further optimization at the level of treatment regimen could provide enhanced antiviral activity. polyamines are important in RNA structure (24), which is crucial for many viruses. polyamines are important for cellular translation via the hypusination of eIF5A (25) DFMO is a stable molecule (12), dissolves in water, and is bioavailable in several forms (30). it is bioavailable in several forms, including to regions where refrigeration is not readily available. combining DFMO with other well-established antivirals may also prove important in combating viral disease. positive correlation between titer and disease severity suggests decreases in viral titers in vivo may be sufficient to reduce disease burden. reducing viral titers in the short-term may provide the host time to develop adaptive immune response to better combat viral infection."}
