{"summary": "conceptual framework adapted from Diderichsen et al. (14) looked at possible sources of disparities during an influenza pandemic. we looked at 3 levels at which underlying socioeconomic or racial/ethnic differences could lead to disparities in illness or death. we looked at possible sources of disparities during an influenza pandemic. higher exposure risk could contribute to health disparities during an influenza pandemic. in the united states, urban poverty and Hispanic and Asian ethnicity are correlated with domestic crowding. in the united states, low-income persons, African Americans, and nonwhite Hispanics are more likely to obtain regular medical care at emergency departments. the influence that most host factors will have on the development of influenza during a future pandemic is uncertain. some evidence suggests that the factors affecting disease severity and death may differ from those typically observed during annual influenza epidemics. however, current plans assume that local and state public health agencies will have a primary role for distributing pandemic influenza vaccine. the weight of available evidence indicates that social disparities in vaccine coverage are likely to occur in the absence of careful planning to prevent them. most influenza illnesses are self-limiting, and most infected persons during both annual influenza epidemics and influenza pandemics recover with only supportive care. evidence from previous outbreaks suggests antiviral drugs may be effective against 1918 and 1918-like viruses. current antiviral drugs seem to be biologically effective against 1918 and 1918-like viruses (28) oseltamivir must be stockpiled for use during pandemic influenza outbreak. blacks and \u201cother minorities\u201d are 71% and 79% as likely as non-Hispanic whites to receive antimicrobial agents within 8 hours of arrival at the hospital. such disparities in quality of care would likely persist during an influenza pandemic. transmission of influenza is airborne, through aerosolized respiratory tract secretions expelled during coughing and sneezing. the influence that most host factors will have on the development of influenza during a future pandemic is uncertain. some evidence suggests that the factors affecting disease severity and death may differ from those typically observed during annual influenza epidemics. the inability to predict which influenza virus will cause a future pandemic is influenced by factors differentially distributed across socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups. in the united states, routine use of annual influenza vaccine in preschool children has only recently been introduced. in the united states, routine use of annual influenza vaccine in preschool children has only recently been introduced. in the united states, routine use of annual influenza vaccine in preschool children has only recently been introduced; information focusing on school-age children is limited. people to report having a usual primary care provider are 2.5\u20134 as likely as their relatively higher income and white counterparts to rely on a hospital-based source of primary care. language and cultural barriers to seeking and receiving medical care also may contribute to disparities. in emergency departments, for example, interpreters are frequently unavailable or underused. a pandemic influenza outbreak in the united states is likely to disproportionately affect persons from socially disadvantaged groups. a pandemic influenza outbreak in the united states is likely to disproportionately affect persons from socially disadvantaged groups. a question asks which groups would be especially vulnerable during an influenza pandemic. the response calls for faith-based and community-based organizations to develop plans to care for dependent populations. the 2005 plan acknowledges that some groups may need financial assistance if they are unable to work. based interventions, such as quarantine and individual isolation, may be important for reducing influenza attack rates and overall incidence. most pandemic plans call for limiting public gatherings and closing schools to slow the spread of influenza. CDC advocates flexible work arrangements, income replacement, and job security to minimize the negative effects of social-distancing measures, but it pays inadequate attention to those whose jobs will not accommodate these interventions. well-documented evidence of existing healthcare disparities suggests that during a pandemic shortages of influenza vaccine, antiviral drugs, inpatient services, and healthcare staff will disproportionately affect persons in socially disadvantaged groups. plans for the release of stockpiles of vaccines, medications, or both could include distribution from private pharmacies or doctors\u2019 offices. plans to make access to potentially lifesaving vaccines and drugs faster and more equitable might, in fact, exacerbate disparities. pandemic preparedness and response planning is likely to exacerbate social disparities in health outcomes. pandemic preparedness and response planning should be applicable across national and subnational settings. the framework used here should be applicable across national and subnational settings."}
