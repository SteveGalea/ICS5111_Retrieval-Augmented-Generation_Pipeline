{"summary": "zootomy, grinding, centrifugation, pipetting, magnetic stirring, egg inoculation, and experimental zoogenetic infection were performed. the collected viruses were tested for activity by measuring their ability to induce hemagglutination with chicken red blood cells and to propagate in chicken embryos after direct inoculation. in 1941, Meyer and Eddie published the first report of laboratory infections due to the Gram-negative bacteria Brucella. in 1949, Sulkin and Pike published a report that summarized 222 laboratory-acquired infections due to viruses. the total number and relative frequency of bacterial laboratory-acquired infections has declined dramatically over time. aerosols are suspensions in the air of solid or liquid particles small enough that they will remain transmissible and airborne for a prolonged period of time. aerosols are remarkably capable of penetrating the physical cellular barrier of the respiratory tract and traveling all the way to the alveolar region. ized H5N1 virus produced by normal procedures used to process the virus for experimental research and by the most frequently associated \u201caccidents\u201d for each, such as container breakage and accidental subcutaneous injection. this information will guide future experimental practice standards to ensure the safety of laboratories and laboratory personnel. none of the aerosol samples collected from any group at the time directly prior to processing of the experiment had detectable levels of H5N1. all liquid aerosols collected from the experimental procedure of group III were also negative for H5N1. 5.6 1.3 30.5 3.3 26.1 3.2 22.3 1.3 21.9 2.4 Positive experimental samples, n/total 0/6 0/6 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 micro-cluster sampling ambient air pollution collection device consists of a controller and six pumps with AGI-30 or Andersen (a) the device relies on the liquid impactor approach to capture airborne viruses (b) red, thin lines and arrows represent the airflow into the sampler. blue, thick arrows represent airflow out of the sampler. Rt-PCR detection of H5N1 in aerosols generated by various experimental procedures Group I: zootomy Group II: grinding group; 3, grinding group; 4, pipetting group; 5, magnetic stirring group; 6, egg inoculation; 7, experimental zoogenetic infection group. the field of laboratory-acquired viral infections has progressed since Sulkin and Pike\u2019s seminal report in 1949 [2] but the problem has yet to be completely eliminated. the paucity of experimental data is an important reason for this. fewer researchers have reported airborne influenza virus from the laboratory. traditional methods of determining the presence of virus in an aerosol include directly applying the concentrated aerosol to infect a host cell. however, Rt-PCR is unable to determine whether the detected virus is infectious. laboratory techniques used to process influenza virus produce aerosols, either through normal operations or common accidents associated with each process. results have great value and implications towards bio-safety. the biosafety level 3 containment laboratory was designed for work with risk group 3 microorganisms in large volumes and Risk group 2 microorganisms at high concentrations. the containment laboratory was equipped with a negative pressure isolation unit, which was used for simulating accidents during laboratory procedures. air samples were collected from the point of initial handling of the centrifuge tube to the centrifuge to the end of the spin. to balance the centrifuge for each spin, the six homogenates were processed in groups of two so that the experiment was repeated three times. air sampling was performed after disinfection for use as the control. air samples were collected throughout and after disinfection, taking 30 min. the procedure was repeated three times, requiring a total of 30 chick embryos to be inoculated. the sensitivity of the Rt-PCR was repeated twice. the virus in each sample would bind to RBCs, causing an agglutination effect that was proportional to the virus concentration. eggs were incubated for 72 h at 37\u00b0C and then chilled overnight at 4\u00b0C. samples from experimental groups were incubated on ice to chill. treated erythrocytes were added at a 1:2.5 (vol/vol) ratio. the sediment was resuspended with 1 mL PBS on ice and recentrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, after which the supernatant was discarded. the expected length of the amplicon was 320 bp. hemagglutination test was performed in 96-wells microtiter plates. airborne biological particles were gathered using liquid impingers. flow rate was 12.5 L min-1 when the pressure drop across the orifice was 41 cm Hg. the tip of the capillary stem was situated 30 mm from the flask bottom. air samples were thawed, ground in a mortar, and transferred to a centrifuge tube for storage at 4\u00b0C. in group III (grinding), the tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. air samples were immediately collected, after disinfection of the area, for a total of 30 min. in group VI (egg inoculation), 10 chick embryos were inoculated with 0.2 mL diluted virus sample (10-fold diluted virus stock solution) per embryo. a total of 30 chick embryos were inoculated in each air monitoring experiment. all of the processes for the three groups were repeated five times. for each, air samples were collected before the procedure for use as the control. the collection time was 30 min. air sampling was performed after disinfection for use as the control. a total of 30 chick embryos were inoculated in each air monitoring experiment. a total of 30 chick embryos were inoculated in each air monitoring experiment. five chickens (7-days-old) was intranasally administered virus at a dose of 0.2 mL per chicken. the zoogenetic infection experiments were repeated three times. air sampling was carried out at intervals of 30 min each. PCR analyses of virus adsorb-proliferation sensitivity. erythrocytes were washed four times with PBS by centrifuging. treated erythrocytes were then resuspended in PBS at 2%. the sediment was resuspended with 1 mL PBS on ice and recentrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. after the incubation, samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was discarded. the entire volume (0.2 mL) of each sample was then used to inoculate a 9-day-old embryonated egg. gene-specific primers for the NP gene of H5N1 were NP-Forward, 5\u2032-GCATTGTCTCCGAAGAAATAAG-3\u2032 and NP-Reverse, 5\u2032-CAGATACT GGGCHATAAGRAC-3\u2032. the expected length of the amplicon was 320 bp. the allantoic fluid was detectable by hemagglutination test. treated erythrocytes were washed four times with PBS by centrifuging. treated erythrocytes were then resuspended in PBS at 2%. the sediment was resuspended with 1 mL PBS on ice and recentrifuged for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. 0.2 mL of the allantoic fluid was used for RNA extraction by the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Cat No. 75182) and then applied to a reaction mix using reagents from the one-step Rt-PCR amplification mini kit (Qiagen Cat No. 210212) the allantoic fluid was detectable by hemagglutination test that performed to confirm the presence of the virus.
