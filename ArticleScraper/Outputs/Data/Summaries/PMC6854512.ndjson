{"summary": "Lassa fever is estimated to cause 100,000 to 300,000 infections annually in west africa. nosocomial epidemics of Lassa fever are associated with higher case fatality rates up to 36 to 65% (2, 3). a seasonal outbreak of Lassa fever occurred in Nigeria in 2018 and led to more than 100 deaths, reemphasizing the threat of LASV on public health. GPs of NW arenaviruses, such as MACV, bind to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to facilitate entry (22), while OW arenaviruses use alpha-dystroglycan (-DG) or neuropilin-2 (NRP2) as their cell surface receptors. GP determines the apical release of nascent LASV from polarized epithelial cells (27) LASV GP possesses 11 potential sites for N-glycan modification, 7 of which are necessary for its proteolytic cleavage. despite lack of cleavage in these latter glycosylation mutants, transport of a single glycosylation site-mutated GPC to the cell surface is not impaired. new therapeutic strategies to control arenavirus-induced diseases require a thorough understanding of virus-host interactions. phorin I (RPN1), ribophorin II (RPN2), TUSC3, MAGT1, STT3A, and STT3B (38\u201340) are specific subunits of STT3B with overlapping functions. MAGT1 and TUSC3 endows STT3B with the capability to posttranslationally glycosylate cysteine-proximal acceptor sites via their oxidoreductase activity. GP1 and GP2 were purified simultaneously from the cell lysates. eluted proteins were trypsin digested and subjected to mass spectrometry. only proteins meeting the following criteria were considered as interactors. HEK293T cells were transfected with a pCAGGs plasmid encoding LASV GP with a C-terminal Twin-Strep-tag or a pCAGGs plasmid expressing only the Twin-Strep-tag as a control. at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested and lysed by using a mild nonionic detergent buffer at 4\u00b0C. 591 proteins were clustered into 22 groups based on the cellular components. multiple proteins were clustered into compartments of the host secretory system. interactors residing in these cellular components might participate in the maturation process of LASV GP. functional subsets from GO molecular function and biological process analyses with high fold enrichment values are highlighted by a red square. MAGT1 and TUSC3 were validated by the coimmunoprecipitation assay shown below and are also presented here.

STT3A\u2013, STT3B\u2013, and WT cells were infected with rLCMV/LASV GPC at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. no significant changes were observed, suggesting knockout of STT3A or STT3B did not affect viral entry or early infection. the means the standard deviations (SD) of three independent experiments. each independent experiment had two replicates. the foci in STT3A\u2013 and STT3B\u2013 cells were notably smaller than those in WT cells. we calculated the ratio of viral titers to viral genome RNA copy numbers in the supernatant as an indicator of viral infectivity. in Fig. 5D, viral particles derived from STT3A\u2013 or STT3B\u2013 knockout cells exhibited reduced viral infectivity. the viral GP in STT3A\u2013 cells reached a level of maturation similar to that observed in WT cells at the late stage of infection (24 and 36 hpi) however, Knockout of STT3A did not significantly affect the glycosylation of LASV GP. however, we observed an obviously hypoglycosylated form of noncleaved GPC in STT3B\u2013 cells. cells infected with rLCMV/LASV GPC virus at an MOI of 0.01 were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected to Western blot analysis with GP2-specific serum. Viral NP was also detected by a specific antiserum, serving as an internal control to reflect the replication level of the virus. virions derived from different cells were collected and screened for viral proteins (GP1, GP2 and NP) cleaved GP1 or GP2 levels were reduced in viral particles derived from STT3A\u2013 and STT3B\u2013 cells, suggesting reduced virus production. knockout of STT3A\u2013 and STT3B\u2013 cells reduced the level of GP incorporated into viral particles. MAGT1 and TUSC3 were required for full glycosylation of LASV GP. despite replaceable functions, MAGT1 mRNA was widely expressed in human tissues. expression of TUSC3 in several cultured cell lines was reported to be difficult to detect by Western blotting. both MAGT1\u2013 and TUSC3\u2013 cells were also reduced in TUSC3\u2013 cells. the level of TUSC3 in WT cells was almost undetectable by Western blotting. a deficiency of MAGT1 was accompanied by obviously increased expression of TUSC3. both MAGT1\u2013TUSC3\u2013 cells and STT3B\u2013 cells were then infected. hek293T cells have seven copies of the MAGT1 gene and two copies of the TUSC3 gene. the observed number of alleles for MAGT1 and TUSC3 could be less than their copy numbers. cells infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus at an MOI of 0.01 were harvested at 36 hpi. MAGT1 and TUSC3 delay folding of nascent polypeptides by forming mixed disulfide bonds with cysteine-proximal glycosylation sequons via their CXXC site motifs. oxidoreductase CXXC active-site motifs of MAGT1 and TUSC3 play roles in the full glycosylation of LASV GP. SC3 with SXXC or CXXS or SXXS mutations were transfected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus at an MOI of 0.01. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus at an MOI of 0.01. cells were harvested at 36 hpi and subjected to Western blot analysis. NGI-1 inhibited the glycosylation of LASV GP mediated by STT3A-OST. hypoglycosylation of LASV GP was most severe in STT3B\u2013 and MAGT1\u2013 TUSC3\u2013 cells compared to that in STT3A\u2013 and WT cells. DMSO was added as a control for cells after virus entry. supernatant viral titers of 10 PFU/ml were considered undetected. supernatant viral titers and viral RNA copy numbers were determined. MV, Mopeia virus (MOPV), Lujo virus (LUJV), and Dandenong virus (DNAV) were transfected into STT3A\u2013, STT3B\u2013, MAGT1\u2013 TUSC3\u2013, and WT cells. the glycosylation patterns of viral GPs were then analysed by Western blotting. supernatant virus titers and viral RNA copy numbers of the LCMV and rLCMV/MACV GPC viruses in HEK293T cells treated with the indicated concentrations of NGI-1. DMSO was added as a control. the viral foci in OST-knockout cells were notably smaller than those in WT cells. titers and viral RNA copy numbers were reduced in OST-knockout cells. the viral foci (36 hpi) in OST-knockout cells were smaller than those in WT cells. the dependence on the host OST complex was conserved among arenaviruses. plasmids encoding the tagged LASV GP or vector plasmid as a control were transfected into HEK293T cells. at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested, and host proteins were purified from the cell lysates. eluted proteins were trypsin digested and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) HEK293T cells were transfected with a pCAGGs plasmid encoding LASV GP with a C-terminal Twin-Strep-tag or a pCAGGs plasmid expressing only the Twin-Strep-tag as a control. at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested and lysed by using a mild nonionic detergent buffer at 4\u00b0C. gene ontology analysis of LASV GP-interacting proteins highlighted the OST complex. to functionally annotate interactors, 591 proteins were clustered into 22 groups based on the cellular components. multiple proteins were clustered into compartments of the host secretory system. the test was performed using the Fisher exact test with an FDR multiple test correction of 0.05. MAGT1 and TUSC3 were validated by the coimmunoprecipitation assay shown below. top overrepresented functional subsets from GO biological process analyses with high fold enrichment values Rank Term_ID Description Fold enrichment 1 GO:1904869 Regulation of protein localization to Cajal body 31.79 2 GO:0000338 Protein deneddylation 21.46 3 GO:1901503 Ether biosynthetic process 17.88 4 GO:0035964 COPI-coated vesicle budding 17.88 5 GO:00086. 11 Ether lipid biosynthetic process 17.88 6 GO:0046504 Glycerol ether biosynthetic process 17.88 7 GO:0006610 Ribosomal protein import into nucleus 17.88 8 GO:0034723 DNA replication-dependent nucleosome organization 17.88 9 GO:0000183 Chromatin silencing at ribosomal DNA 17.88 10 GO:0000470 Maturation of LSU-rRNA 17.88 coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses performed to verify interactions between LASV GP and the OST subunits identified here. transfected cells were harvested and lysed at 4\u00b0C. purified bead fractions were screened for endogenous STT3A (A) and STT3B (B) by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using antibodies specific to human STT3A and STT3B. pCAGGs plasmid encoding V5-tagged RPN1, RPN2 (D), OSTC (E), DDOST (F), MAGT1 (G), and TUSC3 (H) were cotransfected the absence of even a single GP glycosylation site could globally attenuate the arenavirus in vivo (50) we hypothesize that the OST complex is central to GP modification. most glycoproteins in host cells can be modified by both OST isoforms except for special proteins that are preferentially modified by either STT3A or STT3B (51) ulin (SHBG) were reported to be specific N-glycosylation substrates of STT3A or STT3B respectively. knockout of STT3B inhibited the N-glycosylation of only SHBG. rLCMV/LASV GPC virus was detected as a control for each lane. cellular virus levels were determined by the level of viral S (+) genome RNA normalized to the cellular GAPDH mRNA levels. the supernatant virus levels were determined by the immunological plaque assay. Knockout of STT3A or STT3B led to the formation of viral particles with reduced infectivity. we examined intracellular levels of viral nucleoprotein (NP) at 8 h postinfection (hpi), at which time LASV has reportedly finished entry (57). the ratios of viral PFU versus viral genome RNA copy numbers were calculated as an indicator of viral infectivity. all data displayed here represent the means the standard deviations (SD) of three independent experiments. each independent experiment had two replicates. the viral titers decreased dramatically with only mild reductions in the viral genome RNA levels in the supernatants of STT3A\u2013 or STT3B\u2013 cells. we calculated the ratio of viral titers to viral genome RNA copy numbers in the supernatant as an indicator of viral infectivity. in STT3A\u2013 cells, the viral GP showed the same glycosylation pattern as that in WT cells. but the proteolytic cleavage process was hindered in the early stage of infection (24 and 36 hpi) however, the viral GP in STT3A\u2013 cells reached a level of maturation similar to that observed in WT cells at the late stage of infection. ckout of STT3B caused hypoglycosylation of LASV GP. cells infected with rLCMV/LASV GPC virus at an MOI of 0.01 were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected to Western blot analysis with GP2-specific serum. Viral NP was also detected by a specific antiserum, serving as an internal control. incorporation of viral GP into viral particles was reduced in STT3A\u2013 and STT3B\u2013 cells. virions derived from different cells were collected and screened for viral proteins (GP1, GP2 and NP) only cleaved GP1 or GP2 was detected. MAGT1 and TUSC3 were required for the full glycosylation of LASV GP. MAGT1 and TUSC3 are specific subunits of the STT3B-OST complex. the expression of TUSC3 in several cultured cell lines was reported to be difficult to detect by Western blotting. MAGT1\u2013 TUSC3\u2013 cells and TUSC3\u2013 cells were infected with the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus. a deficiency of MAGT1 was accompanied by increased expression of TUSC3. both MAGT1\u2013 TUSC3\u2013 cells and STT3B\u2013 cells were infected with the virus. genomes of MAGT1\u2013 and TUSC3\u2013 cells (A) and MAGT1\u2013 TUSC3\u2013 cells (B) were determined by Sanger sequencing of genomic PCR products. WT cells were also sequenced as a reference. a protein tertiary structure stabilized by disulfide bonds is a negative regulatory factor for their posttranslational glycosylation (60). MAGT1 and TUSC3 delay the folding of nascent polypeptides by forming mixed disulfide bonds with cysteine-proximal glycosylation sequons via their CXXC site motifs. a small-molecule OST inhibitor impaired the propagation of the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus. a small-molecule OST inhibitor impaired the propagation of the rLCMV/LASV GPC virus. cells were harvested at 36 hpi and subjected to Western blot analysis. NGI-1 inhibited the glycosylation of LASV GP mediated by STT3A-OST. hypoglycosylation of LASV GP was most severe in STT3A\u2013 and MAGT1\u2013 TUSC3\u2013 cells compared to that in STT3A\u2013 and WT cells. l were considered undetected and are marked with a red number sign (\u201c#\u201d). DMSO was added as a control. cells and supernatants were harvested at 36 hpi. pCAGGs plasmids encoding GPs of OW arenaviruses were transfected into STT3A\u2013, STT3B\u2013, MAGT1\u2013 TUSC3\u2013 and WT cells. hypoglycosylation patterns of viral GPs were then analysed by Western blotting. the supernatant virus titers and viral RNA copy numbers of the LCMV and rLCMV/MACV GPC viruses were determined by the immunological plaque assay and qRT-PCR. the viral foci were observed by fluorescence microscopy at 36 hpi in cells infected with the rLCMV and rLCMV/MACV GPC viruses. LCMV and rLCMV/MACV GPC were selected as representatives of OW and NW arenaviruses to explore their propagation in STT3A\u2013, STT3B\u2013, MAGT1\u2013 TUSC3\u2013, and WT cells. supernatant viral titers and viral RNA copy numbers were determined by the immunological plaque assay and qRT-PCR. arenavirus GP is first translated into the ER lumen as a GPC precursor. then undergoes a series of folding and modification processes along the secretory pathway to achieve a mature and functional conformation. we systematically identified the host interactors of LASV GP using the AP-MS approach. proteomic analysis identified multiple proteins of the OST complex as interactors of LASV GP. knockout of STT3B caused hypoglycosylation of viral GPC. knockout of STT3A did not have such an effect, suggesting a preferential requirement for the STT3B isoform in the glycosylation of LASV GP. both were shown to be directly or indirectly required for the formation of infectious rLCMV/LASV GPC viruses. the OST complex is a hetero-oligomeric complex consisting of a catalytically active subunit with several noncatalytic auxiliary subunits. the additional components either play a structural role to support the structural stability and enzymatic activity of the OST complex or modulate the N-glycosylation efficiency for certain precursors (65, 66). both STT3A and STT3B are widely expressed in human tissues, and the full glycosylation of polypeptides MAGT1 and TUSC3 are specific subunits of STT3B-OST that have overlapping functions. site-directed mutagenesis further revealed that the oxidoreductase CXXC active site motif of MAGT1 or TUSC3 was essential for the glycosylation of LASV GP. the OST complex uses dolichol-linked oligosaccharides (OS-PP-Dol) as donor substrates for the N-linked glycosylation of asparagine residues in the N-X-T/S consensus sites of newly synthesized proteins. the fully assembled OS-PP-Dol is Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, which is assembled on the cytoplasmic face of the RER by glycosyltransfera chromatography ultraperformance liquid chromatography revealed that the virus possesses an abundance of underprocessed oligomannose-type glycans. it remains unknown whether the site-specific heterogeneity of virion surface glycans has any relevance to the preferential utilization of host OST isoforms by viruses during the glycosylation process. cDNA sequences of viral GPs and GFP were cloned into pCAGGs plasmids with a C-terminal Twin-Strep-tag. pLX304 plasmids encoding V5-tagged RPN1, RPN2, OSTC, DDOST, and pGRN were obtained from a purchased public genome-scale lentiviral expression library of human ORFs. LCMV GP was replaced by LASV GP (Josiah strain) or MACV GP (Carvallo strain) the two plasmids were cotransfected into T7 RNA polymerase stably expressing cells (BSR-T7) four days after transfection, the initially rescued viruses were transferred into BHK-21 cells for further amplification. antisera specific to viral GP1, GP2, and NP were generated by immunizing BA plasmids encoding the OST subunits were transfected with 10 g of plasmid encoding LASV GP with a C-terminal Twin-Strep-tag or an equal amount of plasmid encoding the single Twin-Strep-tag as a control bait. at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were collected and washed with prechilled PBS by low-speed centrifugation. washed beads were resuspended in 100 l of distilled water. then reduced in 2 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich) at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. then alkylation in 5 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min. peptides were then subjected to electrospray ionization. the allowed similarity in REVIGO was set to \"Medium (0.7)\" a semantic similarity measure of \"SimRel\" was selected. the top representative functional subsets with highest fold enrichment values are highlighted in the central region. sgRNA sequences targeting exons of the human STT3A, STT3B, MAGT1 or TUSC3 genes were designed by using the GeneArt CRISPR search and design tool. predesigned sequences with the fewest predicted off-target cleavage sites were selected for each gene. oligonucleotide pairs encoding the 20-nucleotide sgRNA were 5\u2032 phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) and annealed in a thermocycler with the following parameters: 37\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 5 min, and cooling to 25\u00b0C at 5\u00b0C min1. plasmids were transformed into a competent E. coli strain, plated on MAGT1 and TUSC3 double-knockout cells were constructed by transfecting the TUSC3-sgRNA plasmid into MAGT1\u2013 cells to direct a second editing event.
