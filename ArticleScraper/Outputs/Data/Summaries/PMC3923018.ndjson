{"summary": "hepatitis B is considered to be a major public health problem worldwide. 5% of the population is chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus. hepatitis B is considered to be a major public health problem worldwide. a german guideline for testing the virucidal activity of chemical disinfectants characterizes disinfectants effective against enveloped viruses as biocides with limited virucidal activity. disinfectants effective against non-enveloped and enveloped viruses are defined as biocides with virucidal activity. validation of the virucidal action of disinfectants against HBV is essential because the virucidal activity of biocides against HBV cannot be predicted. in vitro propagation of non-cytopathogenic HBV is difficult, especially in obtaining human liver cells. however, in vitro propagation of non-cytopathogenic HBV is difficult, especially in obtaining human liver cells. surrogate models have often been reported for testing the efficacy of biocides against HBV. they validated the integrity of viral DNA by measuring the enzymatic activity of the viral DNA polymerase. however, this test is subjective, and there is a qualitative but not quantitative measurement. a sequence comparison of the two viruses indicated that there is a low nucleotide identity. the host range of the viruses is restricted to mammals (Orthohepadnaviruses) and birds (Avihepadnaviruses) in vitro assays can be propagated in vivo in duck embryonic hepatocytes. diluted viral suspensions exposed to the biocides are injected into nave ducklings not infected with DHBV. ducklings are euthanized 2 wk later, and their livers are removed to be analyzed for DHBV DNA using PCR. virucidal efficacy of biocides by DHBV infection of primary duck embryonic hepatocytes has been established and successfully evaluated for virucidal testing in several studies[68,72,73]. primary duck embryonic hepatocytes were obtained from fertilized Pekin eggs and incubated for 21 d[68]; the liver tissue was harvested from several embryos[74]. a crucial step was to ensure the absence of DHBV in the source tissue using a qualitative growth medium[74] was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. the freeze-thaw process does not significantly reduce the susceptibility of primary duck embryonic hepatocytes to DHBV infection, suggesting no loss of viral receptors on the cell surface. test compounds must be immediately removed from the mixture of virus and test formulation by rapid dilution of samples or the use of sephadex-based methods. however, previous experience has shown that sephadex columns can withhold the infectious virus. a polyvalent rabbit anti-DHBs antiserum that is not commercially available must be used. an in vitro assay requires a demonstration of at least 3-log10 reduction in viral titers beyond any disinfectant dilutions that exhibit cell culture cytotoxicity. indirect immunofluorescence can be employed for routine testing and has been applied to detect a variety of human and animal viruses[91]. the majority of groups waived the in vivo test system. a recent study determined the DHB-virucidal activity of the following five chemical biocides. biocides or measures, including concentrations, temperatures and contact times, are recommended for clinical practice to destroy infectious HBV. in contrast, Table 2 lists the minimal concentrations and contact times for the duck hepatitis B-virucidal activity of several biocides in the quantitative suspension test. ethylene oxide 1999 Australia1 Vickery et al[64] Hydrogen peroxide 2000 Australia1 Vickery et al[95] Glutaraldehyde 2001 United States2 Wagner et al[96] Photoinactivation by dimethylmethylene blue 2002 United States2 Wang et al[69] N-alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride; alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride 2004 United States2 Moore tis B virus published by the world health organization[99] Biocide/measure Concentration/temperature Contact time Remarks Sodium hypochlorite 5% 10 min Inactivation of virus Glutaraldehyde 2% (room temperature) 5 min Inactivation of virus Formaldehyde 5% 2 min Inactivation of virus Isopropanol 70% 2 min Inactivation of virus Ethanol 80% (11 \u00b0C) 2 min Inactivation"}
