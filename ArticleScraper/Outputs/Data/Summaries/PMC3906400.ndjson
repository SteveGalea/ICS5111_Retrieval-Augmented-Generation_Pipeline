{"summary": "DNA immunization technology was discovered in the early 1990s. significant amounts of work have been done in the past 20 y to demonstrate that DNA immunization is effective in eliciting antibody and T cell immune responses against various pathogens. toxin A-specific mAb elicited by DNA immunization demonstrated high biological functions in our study. the immunoglobulin genes from these mAb were also cloned and analyzed. a total of 40 monoclonal positive hybridomas were identified after 5 rounds of screening. the top six monoclonal hybridomas for binding titers were shown in Figure 2. a sandwich ELISA was conducted to select the most sensitive toxin A-detecting mAb pairs. each time, one mAb was used as the capture antibody in a regular ELISA plate while all six mAb, labeled with HRP, were tested individually as the detecting antibodies against captured toxin A. 5D8\u20132C7 and 1G3\u20132C7 were selected as two-paired mAb to test serially diluted toxin A from laboratory or clinical samples at a concentration as low as 2ng/ml. one pilot study was conducted to detect toxin A from C. diff cultured samples. mAb 5D8/2C7-HRP pair in sandwich ELISA detected commercial TcdA toxin in clinical samples. a quantitative determination of toxin A was feasible by using the same 5D8\u20132C7 mAb pair-based ELISA. the amount of toxin A in each sample was determined by using the resulting OD value against the standard curve. mAb concentration was 15 g/ml. mAb 4A4 was the most protective (protecting 50% mice) mAb 2C7 and 5D8 were not much different from isotype control or PBS. recombinant mAb 5D8 and 2C7 were PCR amplified and subcloned into the expression vector, pJW4303. the relative binding abilities against toxin A were compared between hybridoma-produced mAb and recombinant mAb produced by 293F cells. 5D8 belongs to the 1\u20134*01 VH family and 2C7 is part of the VH family 9\u20132-1*01. both 5D8 and 2C7 used kappa chain, which is consistent with the general dominance of kappa chain for mouse light (L) chain of immunoglobulin genes. one study elicited eight mAb against h5 subtype hemaglutinin (HA) antigens and three of them exhibited hemagglutination inhibition (HI) activity. the other study generated two mAb with one targeting the stalk region of hemagglutinins of H1 subtype with broad neutralizing activities but not HI activity. we have compared relative immunogenicity among IM needle injection, gene gun, and EP methods in generating polyclonal serum antibody responses. however, the impact of the DNA immunization method in the production of high quality mAb remains to be investigated. toxin A-specific mAb identified in our study showed high antigen specificity and high antibody affinity. these mAb targeted different epitopes of toxin A, which allowed for the development of a paired detection kit to measure the presence and levels of toxin A in testing samples. DNA immunization offers an attractive approach to study the induction and production of high quality mAb. pJW4303-TcdA-C and pJW4303-tPA-TcdA-C DNA vaccines were cloned into the pJW4303, as previously reported. western blot analysis was conducted to confirm specific expression of expected toxin A. caliper electrode was placed adjacent to the skin of the injection sites. a total of four DNA immunizations were given at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 8. two boost immunizations were conducted at weeks 12 and 15. the 96-well flat-bottom plates were coated with the supernatant from 293T cells transfected with the TcdA-C DNA vaccine plasmid at 1:5 dilution or commercial purchased Toxin A at a concentration of 1 g/ml dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) the last boost was performed using partial purified TcdA-C fragment produced in 293T cells 4 d before fusion. g/ml biotinylated toxin A was added into each well and plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. plates were washed 3 times with washing buffer then 50 l of TMB substrate solution (Thermo scientific, 34028) was added. culture medium was centrifuged at 6000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C to remove cell debris. final product, concentrated bacteria culture filtrate, was stored at -70\u00b0C before use. CHO cells were seeded into a 96-well plate with a concentration of 1 104 cells per well. PCR amplification of mAb genes from hybridomas Total RNA was extracted from 107 hybridomas cells using a commercially available RNA isolation kit. the purified RNA was quantitated spectrophotometrically. the Pfu DNA polymerase exhibits an average error rate of 1.3 10 6 mutation frequency/bp/duplication. all of the DNA vaccine plasmids were produced from E. coli HB101 strain with Qiagen Plasmid Mega kit (QIAGEN, 12181) for in vitro transfection and in vivo animal immunization applications. a total of four DNA immunizations were given at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 8. a final boost was given at week 18, 4 d before splenocytes were collected. biotin stock Solution was first prepared by dissolving 25 mg of toxin A. the 96-well flat-bottom plates were coated with the supernatant from 293T cells transfected with the TcdA-C DNA vaccine plasmid at 1:5 dilution or commercial purchased Toxin A at a concentration of 1 g/ml dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) the last boost was performed using partial purified TcdA-C fragment produced in 293T cells 4 d before fusion. 100 l of 1 g/ml biotinylated toxin A was added into each well. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. plates were washed 3 times with washing buffer. the culture medium was centrifuged at 6000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the final product, concentrated bacteria culture filtrate, was stored at -70\u00b0C before use.

PCR amplification of mAb genes from hybridomas Total RNA was extracted from 107 hybridomas cells using a commercially available RNA isolation kit. the first strand cDNA for the expressed H or L chain was synthesized using a commercially available RNA isolation kit. the Pfu DNA polymerase exhibits an average error rate of 1.3 10 6 mutation frequency/bp/duplication. Taq DNA polymerase was preferred over Pfu DNA polymerase because of its higher amplification efficiency."}
