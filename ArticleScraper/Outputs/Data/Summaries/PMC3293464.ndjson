{"summary": "the reproduction number Rt for day t will be defined as the mean number of secondary cases infected by a case with symptom onset at day t. the reproduction number Rt for day t will be defined as the mean number of secondary cases infected by a case with symptom onset at day t. the method was retrospectively used to analyze the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong. the data consisted of the dates of symptom onset of the 1,755 cases detected in 2003 (4). the method was retrospectively used to analyze the outbreak. the daily counts of symptom onset available until day T are sufficient to estimate Rt. the method described by Wallinga and Teunis (2) is then used to estimate the number of early secondary cases from the daily counts of symptom onsets. the method was retrospectively used to analyze the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong. results Application to Hong Kong SARS Data Figure 1A shows the dates of symptom onset of the 1,755 SARS patients detected in 2003. Figure 1A shows the expectation and 95% credible intervals of the predictive distribution of Rt based on data available at the end of the epidemic. expectations and credible intervals were very similar for lags of 10 and 20 days, 67.8th and 99.7th percentiles respectively, of the distribution of the distribution of the SARS generation interval described by Lipsitch et al. (3). predictive distribution of Rt based on data available at the end of the epidemic. expectation (solid lines) and 95% credible intervals (dashed lines) of the real-time estimator of Rt were calculated at the end of the epidemic (B) and after a lag of 2 (C), 5 (D), 10 (E) and 20 (F) days. the curves show the temporal pattern of Rt based on an average over the 500 simulated datasets as a function of T. even when control measures are completely effective, based on data available up to day 21, the average expectation of R20 is 3 from t = 27 days. reliable estimates were obtained after only 5 days, albeit with wide credible intervals. when the generation interval doubled, the time delay required to detect the effect of control measures implementation roughly doubled. if the subset is small, e.g., the case at the beginning of an emerging disease outbreak, uncertainty will be large. we are trying to find a correction factor for this bias in ongoing research. the method has a natural real-time implementation in which 1) a first estimate of the reproduction number is available after a lag that depends on the generation interval, and 2) while the epidemic goes on, the estimate is consolidated. Xt+(T) given Xt-(T), nt and Xt-(T) given I(T) are combined to derive the distribution of the reproduction number Rt conditional on I(T) conditional on Xt, the number Xt+(T) of early secondary cases is binomial with parameters Xt, WtT. the probability that a case detected at day tT has been infected is where 1. is the indicator function. the distribution of Xt-(T) given I(T) is a sum of independent binomial distributions Xt-(T) | I(T) k T Bin(nk,ptk. data I(T) = nt0 t T are the daily counts of incident onsets. we will make use of the decomposition Xt = Xt-(T) + Xt+(T), where the number of secondary cases Xt from cases with onset at day t has been split in those with onset before T. Xt+(T) | t is Poisson distributed with mean nt t WtT. the same argument would show that Xt+(T) | t is Poisson with mean nt t (1 \u2013 WtT) the expectation and variance of Xt | I(T) are functions of the expectation and variance of Xt-(T) | I(T) alone, derived with the method of Wallinga and Teunis: for the vague prior we specified for t, we obtain As expected, the average proportion of secondary cases detected before T is WtT."}
