{"summary": "-amino acids are intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceutically important compounds. they occur in a number of biologically active compounds such as paclitaxel, bleomycin and the lipopeptide YM-170320. synthesis strategies with high enantioselectivity are desirable. a number of lipases and esterases are commercially available. the limiting factor is the fast and reliable identification of the best fitting enzyme. high throughput assays allow simultaneous measurement of samples in 96- to 1536-well plates so that 105to 107samples may be screended per day. in direct HTS assays product formation is monitored by a change in a physical quantity associated with the product. these mostly synthetic substrates allow for an easy readout by changes in absorbance, fluorescence or by chemiluminescence. the disadvantage of this assays is caused by the difference between the properties of the substrate to the non-natural substrate. 4-nitrophenyl esters are more readily hydrolyzed than esters comprising aliphatic alcohol residues like methanol or ethanol. a spontaneous hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl esters is likely, so that the observed hydrolysis may not be due to an enzymatic activity of BSA. one of the first examples for a convenient indirect assay was the NADH-dependent, coupled enzyme assay for urease. we compared three different indirect assays for the activity of hydrolases. the second assay relies on the change of the pH-value, the second is based on enzymatic oxidation of the released ethanol to acetic acid and the third is based on the oxidation of ethanol to ethanal and hydrogen peroxide. luminol-AOX-HRP system was tested for quantification of ethanol in 96-well plates. for the first time a luminometric AOX-HRP system was tested for quantification of ethanol in 96-well plates. t-statistic t = pos - neg pos 2 n pos - neg 2 n neg Z\u2019-factor Z = 1 - 3 pos - neg SSMDML (method of moment) MM = pos - neg pos 2 - neg 2 SSMDML (maximum likelihood) 99.7% of all samples lie within less than three standard deviations distance from the mean. in 2007, X.D. Zhang derived the SSMD under the condition of independence of both distributions. for increased robustness against outliers, the median of absolute deviation (SSMDR) can be used. SSMD have already been used in RNAi screening and cell-based systems. but never for assays of enzyme catalysis. a wide variety of assays has been established for the detection of efficent hydrolases in vivo or in vitro. a simple indirect HTS-assay detects the pH-shift during a hydrolysis reaction by a pH-indicator molecule. chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates are frequently applied in these assays. hydrolase screening assays is based on non-natural substrates with chromophoric groups. the disadvantage of this assays is caused by the difference between properties of the substrate to the non-natural substrate. 4-nitrophenyl esters per se are no substrate with industrial pertinence. 4-nitrophenyl esters are often not suitable as substrate analogues for screening. alternative approaches are colorimetric pH-assays, which can be employed if one of the products is an acid that subsequently deprotonates or a base that lowers the proton concentration in the medium. the second assay is also well-known and established for measurements of alcohol in food. the third assay is a modification of a chromogenic alcohol-oxidase (AOX)/peroxidase (HRP) ethanol assay for determination of ethanol in beverages. luminometric measurements should be more sensitive due to photons are released by the detection reaction. the rule of thumb for a good HTS assay is S/B >3. however, fluctuations in both the signal and the background are not considered. the higher the S/N ratio, the less do background fluctuation influence the desired signal. J.H. Zhang (1999) defined the Z\u2019-factor based on the normal distribution. the 3-sigma rule of thumb implies 99.7% of all samples lie within less than three standard deviations distance from the mean. the strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) takes the mean difference of negatives and positives in proportion to the standard deviation. the Kolmogorow-Smirnow-Test (KS-test) [52] calculates the maximum distance between two cumulative density functions (CDF) the CDF can be computed for finite number of data points as a cumulative sum of the frequency of occurrence of the (sorted) data. protein purification from the periplasm was carried out by osmotic shock in ddH2O. the supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized overnight. luminescence signal was very weak for ethanol (2.0 mM) HRP, AOX and ethanol were varied in doE to search for the maximum of luminescence intensity (slope) for quantification of ethanol in samples different dilutions of ethanol (0 to 2 mM) were added to the assay mixture, containing 0.5 mM luminol (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 5% (v/v) DMSO (Carl Roth) and 95% 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH the manufacturer\u2019s instructions were adapted to the 96-well plate format using 100 L per well maintaining the ratio of compounds. the assay was started by addition of a 1:10 dilution of aldehyde dehydrogenase solution. pKafor 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoic acid (-keto acid) is almost completely dissociated. calculated pKafor 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoic acid (-keto acid) is 3.56 [60] for comparison of hydrolases equal masses of protein from 10 mg/mL stock solutions were used. ia 28 kDa [65] ALPF Amano lipase Pseudomonas fluorescens 32 kDa [66] pNB-Est13* Esterase M Bacillus licheniformis 55 kDa [68] HRP Peroxidase Armoracia rusticana AOX Alcohol oxidase Pichia pastoris Statistical analysis To evaluate the quality of all proposed assays, we used the equation SSMD Performance 0.8 Z\u2019 1.0 Null-hypothesis rejected SSMD 3.0 excellent assay 0.5 Z\u2019 0.8 good assay 0.5 Z\u2019 0.0 weak assay 0.0 Z\u2019 Null-hypothesis accepted SSMD 3.0 \u201cyes/no\u201d type assay Software contribution R is an environment for interactive analysis of statistical data in bioinformatics. the supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized overnight (Lyophilizer, Beta 1\u20138 Martin Christ) the product was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. the luminescence signal was very weak for ethanol (2.0 mM) a 1:8330 dilution of ethanol (0 to 2 mM) were added to the assay mixture. a 1:8330 dilution of AOX (10\u201340 U/mg, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the assay mixture. a 0.5 mM luminol (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 5% (v/v) DMSO (Carl Roth) and 95% 40 mM sodium the assay was started by addition of a 1:10 dilution of aldehyde dehydrogenase solution. the plate was briefly centrifuged to eliminate bubbles. a positive control for the evaluation test contained only 2.0 mM ethanol without ester and hydrolase. the calculated pKafor 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoic acid (-keto acid) is 3.56 [60] for comparison of hydrolases equal masses of protein from 10 mg/mL stock solutions were used. for comparison of hydrolases equal masses of protein from 10 mg/mL stock solutions were used. seudomonas fluorescens 32 kDa [66] ALM Amano lipase M Mucor javanicus 21 kDa [67] pNB-Est13* Esterase M Bacillus licheniformis 55 kDa [68] HRP Peroxidase Armoracia rusticana AOX Alcohol oxidase Pichia pastoris Statistical analysis To evaluate the quality of all proposed assays, we used SSMD Performance 0.8 Z\u2019 1.0 Null-hypothesis rejected SSMD 3.0 excellent assay 0.5 Z\u2019 0.8 good assay 0.5 Z\u2019 0.0 weak assay 0.0 Z\u2019 Null-hypothesis accepted SSMD 3.0 \u201cyes/no\u201d type assay Software contribution R is an environment for interactive analysis of statistical data in bioinformatics. used to oxidize luminol to 3-aminophthalate by horseradish peroxidase. this well-known chemiluminescent reaction is frequently used in immunoassays. for comparison we used the commercial ethanol assay from r-Biopharm. oxidation by dehydrogenases under conversion of NAD+to NADH. the first step was to optimize all assays by testing different enzyme and compound concentrations without hydrolases. the two step oxidative luminescence assay was optimized by design of experiments. the pH indicator, bromothymol blue, has two absorption maxima in the UV-Vis spectrum at 440 and 620 nm and a pKaat the desired pH value for the cascade reaction of a hydrolase in combination with a -transaminase. extinction coefficient at both wavelengths depends on the pH-value so that both were used for evaluation measurements. KS-statistic test is not necessarily helpful to compare the performance of these types of assays. the pH-based assay at 620 nm performed best, because it has the largest dynamic range. the pH indicator assay at 440 and at 620 nm obtained the highest statistical scores it was chosen for a subsequent small scale screening of a set of different hydrolases with different derivates of ethyl benzoyl acetate. the strong acid HCl (pKa = -6) nearly dissociates to 100% in a wide range of the pH-scale. the turnover number is in [1/s], for illustration turnover values were color coded from blue (low) to red (high) we tested each hydrolase in combination with each ester to determine which hydrolases are the most active ones and which substrates have the highest accessibility. however, upon substrate addition we detected no change in pH-value. the assay results confirm that the pH-assay at 620 nm can indeed be used for substrate-hydrolase screenings. we compared the active site volumes and structural conformations like the opened as well as closed state of RML,Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) and TLL. we compared three different assays based on a set of positive and negative controls by end point measurements. for this purpose we applied for the first time an alcohol oxidase-peroxidase-luminescence assay for ethanol quantification in 96-well format. a robust reduced evaluation approach might be suitable. a standard lysate from the expression host could be included in the evaluation setup. the pH-assay is a very useful method in the search for efficient hydrolases for a cascade reaction. pNB-Est13 esterase was used after osmotic shock with TES-buffer and ddH2O. crude pNB-Est13 esterase was used after osmotic shock. the assays are described in the methods section. the plot was created by Modde 10.1."}
