{"summary": "influenza virion consists of eight negative-strand RNA segments which encode at least 10 proteins known to be essential for infectivity and replication. high mutation rates, together with development of influenza epidemics, make tracing the evolutionary history of the virus and discovering the principles governing the evolution complex. HA functions as a homotrimer composed of two copies of HA1 and one copy of HA2. the globular head (the receptor-binding site) is formed by HA1 and the stem (or stalk) region is formed by both HA1 and HA1 and is responsible for fusion. sBnAbs prevent fusion of the host and virus membranes in the low pH of the endosome by locking HA in a prefusion conformation. sBnAbs prevent the extensive conformational changes in HA required for membrane fusion. additional Fc-dependent mechanisms also contribute to protection in vivo. sBnAbs such as F10 bind to highly conserved regions of HA that are required for the virus to function. the goal of the current study was to identify IAV escape mutants for the sBnAb F10 by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) analysis. ating concentrations of an irrelevant monoclonal antibody, 80R, specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (20) the amplification of virus over time is displayed in Fig. 1B. red and orange boxes indicate virus that was passaged in the absence of antibody. allele frequencies increased with each passage, and none of these mutations were elicited with the irrelevant control 80R antibody or in the absence of antibody. selection coefficients are shown in Fig. 2B, and the posterior estimates of effective population size are shown in Fig. 2C. as expected, Ne is reduced in the challenged population. a reverse genetics approach was employed to generate influenza virus A/Brisbane/59/2007 bearing the individual mutations S123GHA, N203VHA, N460SHA, and E329KNA. the oseltamivir resistance mutation H275YNA (N1 numbering) conferred resistance to F10 relative to wild-type (WT) resistance. the oseltamivir EC50 values for the WT, E329KNA, and H275YNA strains were 0.2, 3.0, and 86.6 M respectively. the reverse genetics enabled the generation of virus harboring the individual selected mutations from in vitro passaging. we measured the plaque diameter of individually cloned viruses to determine the fitness of the identified escape mutations in HA and NA. in the absence of selection pressure by F10, the plaque sizes of the N460SHA and S123GHA mutants were similar to the size of the WT. a one-way analysis of variance multiple-comparison test was performed. we mapped the nonsynonymous mutations N460SHA, S123GHA, and N203VHA onto available crystal structures. notably, the mutations are located away from the F10 binding epitope. the side chain of N460 forms an intermonomer hydrogen bond adjacent to the fusion peptide. the fusion peptide is broken when HA undergoes its conformational change upon fusion. HA1 acts as a clamp on HA2 and stabilizes the metastable prefusion state of HA. the mutation is located adjacent to the fusion peptide. 460S is circled on the structure of HA at neutral pH. the fusion peptide dissociates from the stem of HA and inserts into the endosomal membrane (PDB accession number 1HTM) at acidic pH, the fusion peptide dissociates from the stem of HA and is shown in yellow. emergence of N203VHA has been reported in influenza A/Brisbane/59/2007 virus during propagation of egg-derived virus in either MDCK or Vero cells (30). mutation N203VHA is located in the receptor binding site and forms a hydrogen bond with the human receptor analog sialylneolacto-N-tetraose c (LSTc) the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of the active site in WT NA were higher than those with the E329KNA variant, altering the dynamics of the active site. this alteration in substrate processing by NA may perturb the balance with HA function and counter F10 inhibition. the oseltamivir from PDB accession number 3CL2 (black sticks) is displayed solely to indicate the active site on all four NA molecules. residues are represented on a rainbow scale from blue (positive) to red (negative) red and orange boxes indicate virus that was passaged in the presence of 80R control antibody (experiment 2). gray boxes indicate virus that was passaged in the presence of 80R control antibody (experiment 2). mutations A638G and A639T generate a double mutant in perfect linkage to encode the N203VHA amino acid substitution. the mutant sequence is GGT AAC CAA (GTC, positions 638/639/640; protein, GVQ). the mutant sequence is GGT GTC CAA (GTC, positions 638/639/640; protein, GVQ). a reverse genetics approach was employed to generate influenza virus A/Brisbane/59/2007 bearing the individual mutations S123GHA, N203VHA, N460SHA, and E329KNA as a control. the mutations S123GHA, N203VHA, N460SHA, and E329KNA each conferred resistance to F10 relative to wild-type (WT) resistance. ltamivir EC50 values for the WT, E329KNA, and H275YNA strains were 0.2, 3.0, and 86.6 M, respectively. reverse genetics enabled the generation of virus harboring the individual selected mutations from in vitro passaging. a second independent experiment to determine EC values yielded similar results. we measured the plaque diameter of individually cloned viruses to determine the fitness of the identified escape mutations in HA and NA. however, the plaque sizes of the N460SHA and S123GHA mutants were smaller than the size of the WT. the fusion peptide is buried in a negatively charged pocket in the stem of HA. at acidic pH, the fusion peptide dissociates from the HA stem. the fusion peptide inserts into the endosomal membrane to promote fusion between the viral membrane and the endosomal membrane. HA1 acts as a clamp on HA2 and stabilizes the metastable prefusion state of HA (29) Upon fusion, HA1 undergoes major conformational changes. both N460SHA and S123GHA likely alter the conformational stability of HA. the structure of HA2 at acidic pH is shown, where residue N460 is exposed to the surface and is shown in yellow (PDB accession number 1HTM). residue N460S residue is shown in more detail. mutation N203VHA is located in the receptor binding site. the head region of HA is represented by a gray surface. the location of mutation N203V is labeled with a circle and shown in yellow. the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of the active site in WT NA were higher than those with the E329KNA variant, altering the dynamics of the active site. this alteration in substrate processing by NA may perturb the balance with HA function and counter F10 inhibition. influenza virus have invigorated the influenza virus field, given their potential use for universal therapies and vaccines that protect against a broad spectrum of strains and subtypes. however, antibody neutralization escape mutations can emerge, and understanding neutralization escape together with the molecular mechanisms is critical for designing antibodies that are less prone to resistance. mutations at residues 104, 110, and 115 (in H3 numbering) can impact the pH of fusion due to changes at the HA1-HA2 interface (46, 52) mutations at residue 203 (190 in H3 numbering) have been reported to impact receptor specificity for substrates with an -2,3 or -2,6 glycosidic linkage between the terminal sialic acid and the adjacent carbohydrate. antigenic change in NA may also result from a functional change in HA. a closer inspection of experimental trajectories suggests that the E329KNA mutation may confer resistance against F10 in combination with N203VHA. a similar pattern of drug resistance was described by Ginting et al. the ability of mutant NA to bind HA receptors is demonstrated in vitro. this suggests that HA receptor-binding function can be supplanted by an appropriately evolved NA (61) this results also highlight the role of genetic drift and genetic hitchhiking in determining patterns of sequence evolution in IAV. IAV can use diverse and indirect molecular mechanisms to escape neutralization by sBnAbs. additive and synergistic effects of single HA and NA mutations and combination mutations on virus replication in the presence and absence of antiviral drugs and sBnAbs can be monitored. unbound virus was washed off with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were overlaid with agar (0.5%) in modified Eagle\u2019s medium-F12 medium (DMEM-F12) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin, l-glutamine, bovine serum albumin, and acetylated trypsin. the EC50 and EC90 values were defined as the concentrations of antibody that reduced plaque number to 50% and 90% of the levels of the no-drug control. if 50% CPE was present, the concentration of antibody was escalated at a lower rate. libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform to generate 100-nucleotide reads. an integrated bioinformatics pipeline was developed to trim and bin read data based on barcode, to align reads to the reference IAV genome and quantify the level of nucleotide and amino acid variability within the viral population. genetic drift alone used the Wright-Fisher ABC approach to estimate a global effective population size (Ne) and per-site selection coefficients (s) based on the allele frequency trajectories through time (21, 22, 42). if at least 99% of the posterior probability density of the selection coefficient was positive, the site was considered to be significant.
