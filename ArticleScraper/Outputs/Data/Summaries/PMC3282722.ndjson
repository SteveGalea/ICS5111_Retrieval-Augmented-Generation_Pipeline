{"summary": "habitat hotspots - places attracting a large number of individuals or social groups - can significantly alter contact patterns and disease propagation. in territorial animals, epidemiologically important contacts may primarily occur as animals cross through territories of conspecifics en route to habitat hotspots. limiting transmission at hotspots has become a promising strategy for mitigating epidemics. in humans, schools and working places are typical examples of hotspots. limiting transmission at hotspots has become a promising strategy for mitigating epidemics. infective contacts may be observed when infectious individuals travel to the hotspot and cross the territory of susceptible individuals. this second type of transmission may be prominent when the disease reduces the mobility of sick individuals. in humans, sick individuals often stay home, which alters disease dynamics. the model has a 5151 lattice structure, where each cell of the lattice corresponds to a group's territory. the probability of a visit by group i is a decreasing function of the Euclidean distance between the group's territory and the hotspot. transmission is possible between a travelling group and the groups residing in cells traversed en route to the hotspot. when a group visits the hotspot, it follows a Biased Random Walk from its home cell to the hotspot and returns to its home cell on the same day. each turning angle is randomly drawn from a normal distribution N (0, 2). the per-time-step probability of becoming infected during transit to a hotspot depends on the number of infectious individuals Ic in each group c encountered. the per-time-step probability of becoming infected during transit to a hotspot depends on the number of infectious individuals Ic in each group c encountered en route. in the \u201cSick-stay\u201d model, groups that included at least one infected individual \u2013 infected groups \u2013 were assumed to stop travelling to the hotspot; in the \u201cSick-travel\u201d model, infected groups continue to travel to the hotspot as if uninfected. in the \u201cSick-stay\u201d model, disease transmission can only occur from an infected resident to a susceptible traveler. the model has a 5151 lattice structure, where each cell of the lattice corresponds to a group's territory. the probability of a visit by group i is a decreasing function of the Euclidean distance. transmission is possible between a travelling group and the groups residing in cells traversed en route to the hotspot. when a group visits the hotspot, it follows a Biased Random Walk from its home cell to the hotspot and returns to its home cell on the same day. each turning angle is randomly drawn from a normal distribution N (0, 2). the per-time-step probability of becoming infected during transit to a hotspot depends on the number of infectious individuals Ic in each group c encountered en route. the per-time-step probability of becoming infected during transit depends on the number of infectious individuals in each group c encountered. in the transmission model, groups that included at least one infected individual \u2013 infected groups \u2013 were assumed to stop travelling to the hotspot. in the transmission model, infected groups continue to travel to the hotspot as if uninfected. the model was implemented in Delphi 7 (Borland Software Corporation, 2002). group size 10 travel characteristics R: Hotspot radius of attraction 0\u201335 Pmax: Visit probability for groups located next to the hotspot 0.1 S. within-group transmission probability 0.02\u20130.06 PB: Between-neighbours transmission probability 4e-04 \u2013 16e-04 PT: Traveler-resident transmission probability 1e-06 \u2013 1e-03 Results Epidemiological impacts of transmission rates. each graph presents a different value of the traveler-resident transmission rate (PT) each value is based on 1000 simulations in which disease was introduced randomly in one of the eigth groups adjacent to the hotspot. the greater this distance, the lower the probability that a group visiting the hotspot encountered the group initially infected. groups ranging close to the hotspot encountered larger numbers of potentially infected groups. groups ranging at intermediate distances experienced the greatest number of potentially infected contacts with resident groups encountered en route to the hotspot. the difference in spatial pattern of disease spread observed between the models is insensitive to the parameter values. we assessed the epidemiological impact of the hotspot on groups that never visit it because they range at a distance larger than R from the hotspot. the attack rate for these groups was found to be larger than expected under a model with no hotspot (R = 0) each value is averaged over 1000 stochastic simulations assuming R = 30, Pw = 0.06, PT = 4e-04. each hotspot was located randomly in the population, and disease was introduced into the group. attack rate increases with the hotspot radius of attraction R, and the traveler-resident transmission probability PT. each value is based on 1000 simulations in which disease was introduced randomly in one of the eigth groups adjacent to the hotspot. the greater this distance, the lower the probability that a group visiting the hotspot encountered the group initially infected. the Sick-stay model yields higher attack rates than the Sick-stay model. groups ranging at intermediate distances experienced the greatest number of potentially infective contacts with resident groups encountered en route to the hotspot. when epidemics occur, the difference in spatial pattern of disease spread observed between the models is insensitive to the parameter values. PB is high enough to allow some between-neighbour transmission. the attack rate for groups that never visit the hotspot was found to be larger than expected under a model with no hotspot (R = 0) the relationship between the number of hotspots and the attack rate is bell-shaped. each hotspot was located randomly in the population, and disease was introduced into the group ranging in the middle of the habitat. our model extends previous studies focusing on transmission at the hotspot. hotspots can also strongly alter disease transmission by generating infective contacts between animals travelling towards or from the hotspot and animals whose territories are traversed. hotspots are expected to influence disease dynamics significantly, even when infected groups do not travel to the hotspot at all. however, the hotspot effect strongly decreases as the distance between disease introduction and the hotspot increases. shaped function of the number of hotspots challenges the hypothesis that the number of hotspots and disease prevalence will correlate positively [8] wildlife managers may consider increasing, rather than decreasing [36] the number of water holes in order to reduce the number of highly-connected individuals or social groups. the spatial pattern of the disease impact will be qualitatively similar to that observed for the Sick-stay model. previous studies have focused on disease transmission occurring at the hotspot itself. in some ecological systems, both transmission modes may coexist. the relationship is presented for different values of the hotspot radius of attraction. each graph represents a combination of the between-neighbour (PB) and the traveler-resident (PT) transmission. the disease was introduced randomly in one of the eight groups adjacent to the hotspot."}
