{"summary": "the tripeptide -l-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine, or glutathione (GSH), is the most abundant intracellular thiol found in a concentration range of 1\u201310 mM. it is localized in the cytosol (up to 90%), but is also present in the mitochondria (10%), the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nucleus in a small percentage. redox-mediated signal impacts proteins through a specific amino acid residue (i.e., cysteine) several modifications of the thiol group can occur for structural needs, such as inter/intrachain disulfide \u2013SS\u2013 or different degrees of oxidative stress. the reaction can be catalyzed by different enzymes belonging to the family of thiol\u2013disulfide oxidoreductases or redoxins. reversibility and catalysis are important requirements for the regulatory role of the process [22,23]. microbial proteins also undergo glutathionylation. the thiol group can quickly react with and neutralize potentially dangerous molecules, both of endogenous and exogenous origin. it plays a crucial role in cell fate, regulating processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. the concentration of GSH and its oxidized form, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), mainly determines the redox state of the cell. cysteine thiol group is localized in a basic milieu that stabilizes the thiolated form \u2013S and represents a very reactive group. the formation of glutathionylated proteins (GSSPs) has been known for many years. reversibility and catalysis are important requirements for regulatory role of the process. virus-induced redox imbalance has been measured in terms of ROS overproduction and/or GSH depletion in different viral infections. it is not surprising to wonder if glutathionylated proteins are detectable during viral infections and if viral proteins themselves undergo glutathionylation. the protease of another retrovirus, HTLV-1, could be regulated by reversible oxidation in a similar way to that observed for HIV protease. this could be an important evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could prevent the premature activation of retroviral proteases in infected cells. authors suggest glutathionylation may be a general mechanism for this family of viruses to regulate NS5 activities. however, how this modification alters the multiple other functions of the protein and how this could affect viral replication remain to be elucidated. redox proteomic technique based on the use of biotinylated glutathione. a set of proteins, including redoxins such as peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) and thioredoxin (TRX), was found to be released in glutathionylated form by lipopolisaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages and influenza-virus-infected cells. redox compartmentalization can contribute to disease mechanisms due to disruption of redox signaling and control. reductive stress, as well as oxidative stress, can contribute to disease mechanisms due to the disruption of redox signaling and control. a significant proportion of the peptides stimulating immune cells have been shown to contain glutathionylated cysteines. a growing number of bacteria proteins have been identified to be S-glutathionylated, S-bacillithiolated, or S-mycothiolated. a top-down proteomic approach identified over 500 proteins with 1665 post-translational modifications. nine s-glutathionylated proteins switched to s-cysteinylation under infection-like conditions, suggesting this shift could be a novel redox mechanism of infection control. glutathionylation affects host cytokine production in response to Borrelia burgdorferi infection. metabolites have been found to be altered in patients with early onset of Lyme disease. redox signaling is a potential target for antiviral strategies. the protease of another retrovirus, HTLV-1, could be regulated by reversible oxidation in a similar way to that observed for HIV protease. this suggests that glutathionylation induces conformational changes in the protein that can also affect sites far from those that have been glutathionylated. the same authors showed that dengue and Zika NS5 proteins were glutathionylated in three cysteines. the post-translational modification reduced the guanylyltransferase activity of the enzyme from both viruses. however, how this modification alters the multiple other functions of the protein and how this could affect viral replication remain to be elucidated. it has been reported that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is deglutathionylated by Grx during Sendai virus infection to efficiently activate the transcription of interferon genes. it has been shown that HSV infection induced the production of ROS that mediate the glutathionylation of proteins belonging to the TRAF family, in particular, TRAF3 and TRAF6, which are essential for the proper activation of the antiviral innate immune response. a significant proportion of the peptides stimulating immune cells have been shown to contain glutathionylated cysteines. this could be a redox mechanism for the virus to negatively impact the immune response. this could be a redox mechanism for the virus to negatively impact the immune response. a growing number of bacteria proteins have been identified to be S-glutathionylated, S-bacillithiolated, or S-mycothiolated. a top-down proteomic approach identified over 500 proteins with 1665 post-translational modifications, among which 25 were s-thiolation. this suggests that this shift could be a novel redox mechanism of infection control for these proteins. the same authors demonstrated Fas glutathionylation in patients with P. aeruginosa pneumonia. this showed that the modification promoted bacteria clearance. these results indicate the importance of the Grx1/Fas glutathionylation axis in the resolution of the disease. the treatment of endothelial cells with an electrophilic compound (cinnamaldehyde) induced p65-glutathionylation, leading to the inhibition of TNF-induced p65 nuclear translocation and ICAM-1 expression. the downregulation of Grx1 abolished p65-glutathionylation and blocked the inhibition of its nuclear translocation and ICAM-1 expression. p65 and IKKa have been shown to be negatively regulated via glutathionylation. both p65 and IKKa have been shown to be regulated by the Grx1/glutathionylation axis in IL-17A-stimulated epithelial cells. diagram summarizing the effect or biological role of glutathionylation on proteins described in this review. it is well known that infections cause a redox imbalance towards pro-oxidant conditions in the cell. we believe that glutathionylation fits into these virus-induced changes to regulate its replication and/or cell response. the transient glutathionylation of NFB could also take part in the regulatory processes committed by infections. a deeper knowledge of the chemical and regulatory processes through which glutathionylation occurs could pave the way for the identification of novel targets to control microbial infections."}
