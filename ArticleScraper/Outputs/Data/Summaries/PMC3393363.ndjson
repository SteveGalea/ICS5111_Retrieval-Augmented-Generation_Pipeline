{"summary": "alphaviruses are among the viral vectors being developed and undergoing clinical testing due in part to their ability to stimulate humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses. alphaviruses belong to the Togaviridae family and contain a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 12 kb encoding four nonstructural proteins in the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome. a strong subgenomic promoter directs expression of replicon particles can be produced by providing structural proteins to replicon RNA in cultured production cells. the replicon particles have been shown to be highly efficient for eliciting antigen-specific immune responses in a variety of animal models. vaccinia virus vector failed to induce strong immune responses in the presence of antivector immunity. replicon particles encoding an unrelated antigen are still able to generate strong humoral antibodies against the HA antigen. the antigen concentration was measured as the content of HA in the preparation. a seed stock of the RESVIR17 (H3N2) strain was kindly provided by the national institute for medical research, United Kingdom. a consensus sequence of each HA segment was determined from multiple clones. the sequence identical to the consensus sequence from the RESVIR17 (H3N2) strain was further transferred to the VCR-Chim2.1 vector (16, 38) the replicon particles derived from the HA sequence of RESVIR17 (H3N2) were referred to as VEE/SIN-H1 and VEE/SIN-NP. group of 10 mice were immunized through intramuscular (i.m.) routes with 50 l of replicon particles (VEE/SIN-H1 and VEE/SIN-H3, 102 to 106 infectious units [IU]/mouse) at 3-week intervals. survival of the challenged mice was monitored for 14 days after infection. group of 10 mice each were immunized three times with either inactivated PIV-3 virus or VEE/SIN-PIV3. the data are presented as anti-gp140 serum IgG1 (A) and IgG2a (B) endpoint antibody titers. dilutions of sera were added to coated and blocked ELISA plates. anti-HA and anti-SARS-spike antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), followed by p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) substrate. -galactosidase reporter cells were infected with 4 104 IU VEE/SIN replicon particles expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) the samples were then incubated at 37\u00b0C at 5% CO2 for 1 h and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C and 7% CO2. the resulting RLU of each test sample was converted to percent inhibition using the formula % inhibition = [1 (experimental RLU background RLU)/(total RLU \u2013 background RLU)] 100. blot was treated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) the membrane was exposed to amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare Limited, United Kingdom) to visualize HA-specific bands. influenza strains, viral seeds were processed for RNA extraction using the RNeasy kit. the extracted RNA was reverse transcribed, followed by PCR using primers of sequences at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the HA coding region. a consensus sequence of each HA segment was determined from multiple clones. groups of 10 mice were immunized through intramuscular (i.m.) routes with 50 l of replicon particles (VEE/SIN-H1 and VEE/SIN-H3, 102 to 106 infectious units [IU]/mouse) at 3-week intervals. survival of the challenged mice was monitored for 14 days after infection. both groups were given two booster immunizations with VEE/SIN-gp140. the data are presented as anti-gp140 serum IgG1 and IgG2a endpoint antibody titers. the mean of each group shown as horizontal bars. animals were monitored on a daily basis and euthanized when they exhibited defined humane endpoints (over 20% of body weight loss) dilutions of sera were added to coated and blocked ELISA plates. the blanks consistently displayed OD405 of 0.1 and 10% variability. a high-throughput assay was developed that used cells stably transfected with a -galactosidase reporter that is activated by VEE/SIN replicon particle-encoded nonstructural proteins. the -galactosidase reporter assay was completed following manufacturer's recommendations. 0.02 ml of each lysate was added to 0.07 ml of dilution buffer plus Galacton-Plus. the resulting RLU of each test sample was converted to percent inhibition. the protein extract from 1.5 105 IU of the replicon particles and 1 g each of total cell lysates were loaded on the gel. the membrane was incubated with 1:1,000 diluted mouse anti-RESVIR17 antisera, followed by incubation with 20,000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP) anti-mouse antibody. mice were vaccinated once or twice with 102, 103, or 104 IU of VEE/SIN-H1. mice that received one and two doses of 104 IU were completely protected from the lethal influenza virus challenge. within the group of mice that was vaccinated twice with 103 IU of VEE/SIN-H1, 1 of 10 animals died at 1 day after challenge. we subcloned the sequence encoding the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) into the chimeric vector and prepared replicon particles expressing SARS-spike protein. the hyperimmunization induces immune responses to various components of replicon particles, including VEE virus nonstructural proteins. only anti-envelope antibodies are expected to neutralize cellular entry of the replicon particles. groups of 10 mice were immunized three times with 107 IU of VEE/SIN-SSP replicon particles. the treated mice were further immunized once (dashed lines) or twice (solid lines) with 104 IU of VEE/SIB-H1 replicon particles. a group was also treated 5 times with PBS (dotted line with crossed symbols) iters of the sera from these animals were used to evaluate suppressive effect of prior hyperimmunization. the animals vaccinated with the VEE/SIN-SSP yielded immune responses specific for the H3 protein that were as high as those of the control group. Sera were assayed after 2 weeks of the first (post1) and the second (post2) immunization with VEE/SIN-H3. an undetectable level of HA protein contamination in the alphavirus replicon particle preparation. serum neutralization titers were determined at 90% inhibition of infection of BHK cells. the hemagglutination inhibition assay (10) was used to evaluate protection in serum immunized with antigens derived from virus that cannot infect the animal. the hyperimmunized group was treated four times with 107 IU of VEE/SIN-SSP replicon particles. vaccinated rabbits with four priming doses of VEE/SIN-PIV3 followed by three i.m. boosting doses of VEE/SIN-H3. a second group of rabbits were also vaccinated i.m. with three doses of VEE/SIN-H3. vaccinations of mice or rabbits with VEE/SIN replicon particles encoding one antigen did not cause a decrease in serum antibody titers against a new antigen. the vector-nave group of new Zealand white rabbits (n = 10) were given two priming doses of a subtype-B gp140SF162V2 DNA at weeks 0 and 4, followed by immunization of two booster doses with o-gp140SF162 vaccinated mice once or twice with 105 and 106 IU of VEE/SIN-H1. mice that received one and two doses of 104 IU were completely protected from the lethal influenza virus challenge. within the group of mice that was vaccinated twice with 103 IU of VEE/SIN-H1, 1 of 10 animals died at 1 day after challenge. mice were challenged with 300 mLD50 of influenza virus intranasally. after the challenge, the number of surviving animals from each group was monitored. the hyperimmunization induces immune responses to various components of replicon particles. mice were immunized three times with 107 IU of VEE/SIN-SSP replicon particles (open circles) or PBS (open triangles) the treated mice were further immunized once (dashed lines) or twice (solid lines) with 104 IU of VEE/SIB-H1 replicon particles (dotted line with crossed symbols) mice were vaccinated i.m. with 104 IU of VEE/SIN-H3 particles. HA-specific antibody titers of the sera from these animals were used to evaluate suppressive effect of prior hyperimmunization. the titers were indicated as geometric means of results for 5 mice hyperimmunized with VEE/SIN-SSP (open circles) or treated with PBS (closed circles) before immunization with VEE/SIN-H3. an undetectable level of HA protein contamination in the alphavirus replicon particle preparation. anti-replicon neut titers HI titers Hyperimmunized Control Hyperimmunized Control Hyperimmunized Control Hyperimmunized Control 10 10 7,656 10 10 40 320 160 10 10 20,421 10 10 40 480 320 10 10 171 10 40 480 320 10 10 138 10 10 40 320 320 10 10 2,437 10 10 40 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 320 preexisting antivector immunity does not interfere with protective immune responses after immunization using the same alphavirus replicon vector. for this purpose, we determined whether the three priming i.m. vaccinations with VEE/SIN-PIV3 would result in decreased serum antibody responses against two subsequent i.m. vaccinations with the same vector bearing a different antigen. both the vector-nave and the vector-preexposed rabbits elicited strong anti-HA antibody responses. all rabbits from the first group induced high titers of antibodies against SF162 envelope as well as high levels of antivector neutralizing responses. these data show that vaccinations of mice or rabbits with VEE/SIN replicon particles encoding one antigen did not cause a decrease in serum antibody titers against a new antigen. the chimeric replicon particles have shown improved humoral responses compared to SIN virus-based replicon particles. the chimeric replicon particles expresses the replicase from VEE virus, which is known to be less sensitive to type 1 interferon (IFN) chimeric replicon particles are derived from those of SIN virus with a point mutation to more efficiently infect dendritic cells (DCs) the high potency of alphavirus replicon particles is advantageous to induce better protective immunity. however, such robust immune responses might induce antivector immunity that would reduce vaccine efficacy when administered repeatedly. replicon particles were also protective when mice were challenged with lower virus doses. a significant proportion of the human population already has antibodies against a number of adenovirus serotypes (37) the broad seroprevalence of the human population may limit application of the vector. in the case of alphaviruses, the viruses are not commonly infecting the human population and most individuals are negative for anti-alphavirus immunity. the alphavirus replicon particles may be applicable to humans for multiple administrations without decreasing efficacies. this characteristic is of particular advantage for some pathogens, such as influenza viruses, which very often change their antigenicity (antigenic drift); anti-influenza vaccines must be prepared according to the prediction of an outbreak every year. the present study directly addressed the effect of preexisting antivector immunity. it is possible to argue that the hyperimmunization did not induce antivector immunity. in vitro neutralization might be attributed rather to antibodies against molecules that function as receptors for alphavirus entry. but we did not detect anti-bovine serum antigen antibodies from particle-immunized mouse sera. in the present study, we noticed early deaths after challenge in the group immunized with 103 IU (Fig. 1) and the group of hyperimmunized animals (107 IU with VEE/SIN-SSP followed by 104 IU with VEE/SIN-H1) (Fig. 2). are these a sign of adverse effects caused by particle immunization. this is unlikely because there is no dose dependence."}
