{"summary": "the aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of oral candidiasis, other mucosal lesions, and xerostomia during interferon therapy for HCV infection. cultures of Candida from the tongue surfaces were positive in 7 (50.0%) of the 14 patients with HCV infection at least once during IFN therapy. the incidence of Candida during treatment with IFN did not increase above that before treatment. the level of albumin at the beginning of the 6th month of IFN administration was lower than in group 2 (P=0.0550) one factor, the presence of oral mucosal lesions, was associated with the detection of Candida. the adjusted odds ratio for the factor was 36.00 (95% confidence interval 2.68-1485.94) OLP was seen in 11.7 (11/94)-16.7% (4/24) during and after IFN treatment. hepatitis C pathogenesis may be attributed to host factors induced by HCV infection, rather than direct pathological effects of the virus. g-IFN alfa-2a and RBV involving 199 patients with chronic hepatitis C, including 99 patients with IFN treatment-naive genotype 1 and 100 patients with patients whom had not had a SVR after IFN therapy, 6.5% of all patients developed dry mouth. there have been few reports on oral Candida before, during and after IFN treatment for chronic hepatitis C patients. 14 patients, 3 men and 11 women, who completed IFN therapy were examined. they ranged in age from 25 to 70 years, with an average age of 56.00 12.94 years. one patient with liver cirrhosis received administration of IFN beta for 24 weeks. all patients were examined before IFN therapy, at the beginning of the 2nd week of IFN administration, at the beginning of the 6th month of IFN administration, and at 6th months after the end of treatment. Candida isolation We examined Candida species on the surface of the tongue in 14 patients with chronic liver diseases before, during, and after IFN therapy. the presence of anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies in all patients was tested by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the normal levels of anti-SS-A (SS-A/Ro(E)[S] and anti-SS-B (SS-B/La(E)[S] are less than 10 U/mL, respectively. patients A total of 124 consecutive patients for whom IFN therapy was planned had checkups for oral mucosal diseases. seventeen of 124 patients agreed to the simultaneous consultation of the hepatologist and oral surgeon in order to receive administration of Peg-IFN and an oral examination once per week. the other 107 patients did not consult a doctor every week. all patients were examined before IFN therapy, at the beginning of the 2nd week of IFN administration, at the beginning of the 6th month of IFN administration, at the end of IFN therapy, and at 6th months after the end of treatment. the patients were weighed at each hospital visit. b was inoculated into CHROMagar Candida medium by rotating the swab head on the surface of the medium. the plates were incubated at 35oC for 48 h. patients were tested for platelets (PLT), white blood cell (WBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) all patients were examined before IFN therapy, at the beginning of the 2nd week of IFN administration, at the beginning of the 6th month of IFN administration, and at 6th months after the end of treatment. a salivary flow rate of below 2 g/2 min was measured. all patients were examined before IFN therapy, at the beginning of the 2nd week of IFN administration, at the beginning of the 6th month of IFN administration, and at 6th months after the end of treatment. Candida isolation We examined Candida species on the surface of the tongue in 14 patients with chronic liver diseases before, during, and after IFN therapy. the normal levels of anti-SS-A (SS-A/Ro(E)[S]; TFB, Ink, Japan) and anti-SS-B (SS-B/La(E)[S] are less than 10 U/mL, respectively. the normal levels of anti-SS-A (SS-A/Ro(E)[S] are less than 10 U/mL. the incidence of positive Candida cultures was 42.86% (6 cases, C. albicans) before IFN therapy, 7.14% (1 case, C. albicans) at the beginning of the 2nd week of IFN administration, 35.71% (4 cases, C. albicans; 1 case, C. lusitaniae) at the end of IFN therapy and 21.43% (2 cases, C. albicans; 1 case, C. tropicalis) at the end of treatment. albicans 3 C. albicans 1 C. albicans 1 C. albicans 1 C. albicans 1 C. albicans 2 C. tropicalis 1 OLP OLP OLP OLP OLP 3 33 F CH-C 1b High Peg-IFN/RBV + group 2 C. albicans 2 4 53 F LC-C ND (serogroup 2) Low IFN beta group 2 5 70 F CH-C 2a High Pe albicans 1 C. albicans 1 C. albicans 1 angular cheilitis 12 69 F CH-C 1b High Peg-IFN/RBV + + + + + group 1 C. albicans 1 C. albicans 1 C. albicans 1 angular cheilitis 13 60 M CH-C 1b High Peg-IFN/RBV group 2 14 62 M CH-C 1b Low Peg-IFN oral mucosal lesions were observed in 50.00% (7/14) of patients. three with OLP (21.43%, 2 men and 1 woman), three with angular cheilitis (21.43%, 3 women) and one with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (77.14%, 1 woman) thous stomatitis (n=1) in group 2 was OLP (n=1).
