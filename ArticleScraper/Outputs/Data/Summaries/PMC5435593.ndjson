{"summary": "non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is not effective in treating respiratory failure in severe pneumonia. however, some clinicians attempt NIV to indirectly deliver adequate oxygenation and avoid unnecessary endotracheal intubation. this is of the utmost importance in avoiding any delay. a trial of NIV may have a benefit to treat hypoxemic respiratory failure. it is reported that NIV can avoid intubation in 54% of acute respiratory distress (ARDS) and therefore reduce ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) by approximately 20% and reduce the mortality rate in the ICU by up to 54%. however, the use of NIV in pregnant women has remained controversial in severe pneumonia. tracheal aspirate and urine culture were negative. negative results for nasopharyngeal swab for H1N1. also tested negative for dengue, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. the main indications for NIV are to provide adequate oxygenation. prolonged hypoxia results in increased fetal morbidity and mortality. in cases of severe respiratory failure during pregnancy, there is a risk of preterm delivery of up to 80% during the third trimester and a risk of spontaneous miscarriage of up to 57% during the first trimester. the use of NIV can decrease mortality by 48%, decrease the rate of intubation by 59% and decrease hospital length of stay by 3.24 days [8]. it can also be used to treat other disorders such as pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient, post-operative respiratory failure, hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and asthma. the patient should be intubated immediately to prevent prolonged hypoxia in the fetus. if the arterial blood gases show worsening respiratory failure, the patient should be intubated immediately to prevent prolonged hypoxia. NIV can be used in a pregnancy complicated by severe hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to community acquired pneumonia with a CURB-65 score of 1 and a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of 4."}
