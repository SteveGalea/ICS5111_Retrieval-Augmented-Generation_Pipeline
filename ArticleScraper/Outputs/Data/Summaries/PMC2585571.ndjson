{"summary": "interleukin (IL)-12, a crucial innate cytokine, was found to be regulated by such xenobiotic agents. in vivo experiments were set up where BALB/c mice were exposed to sub-lethal doses of Cd or Hg salts for 3 or 5 weeks. heavy metal pollution has attained high visibility in the public arena. some inconsistencies have been evolved especially regarding the effects of low-dose exposure. cytokines are very important agents to detect modulations of the immune system. the common precursor Th0 secretes cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-; Th1 cells produce IL-2, IFN-, TNF-, and low levels of IL-10 (only in human); and Th2 cells IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13 [20-22] and IL-6 [23]. differentiation into Th1 cells requires the presence of IL-12. interleukin-12 is a 70-kDa heterodimeric (p35/p40) pro-inflammatory cytokine. it is considered to date the most critical factor for skewing the immune response towards a Th1 type. however, there are clues that IL-12, in synergy with IL-4, supports the long-term proliferation and maturation of resting CD4+ T cells into IFN- or IL-4-producing cells. cytokines were assessed by ELISA, cytometric bead-based array and RT-PCR. the experiments were approved by the local authorities and informed consent of participating subjects were obtained. cell cultured (1 106 cells/1 mL/well) in 48-well microtiter plates. cells were activated with agonistic CD3 (OKT3, mouse IgG1, Ortho Biotech, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) mAb, 100 ng/mL each, or with hkSE (1.25 105 CFU/mL; ade-, his-, SALMOVAC SE\u00ae, Impfstoffwerk Dessau-Tornau, Rossl mice were injected intraperitoneally every third day with isotonic NaCl solution (controls) or with Cd or Hg (1.25 mg/kg body weight) mice were sacrificed at day 21 and other mice were sacrificed following 3 or 5 weeks of exposure to the heavy metal. ilutions or test samples were added to appropriate tubes (20 L/tube), PE detection reagent (20 L) was added and the tubes were incubated for 2 hr in dark at RT. samples were washed with 1 mL wash buffer and centrifuged for 5 min. sequences of sense (s) and antisense (as) mouse primers were: 5'-CCC ACT AAC ATC AAA TGG GG-3' and 5'-CCT ACA ATG CCA AAG TT-3' and 5'-TCT GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GTG GC-3 data analysis was performed using Statistica 5.1 software (Statsoft, Hamburg, Germany) Variations among cytokine profiles of different donors were tested using a nonparametric ANOVA, the Kruskal-Wallis test. cells were activated with agonistic CD3 (OKT3, mouse IgG1, Ortho Biotech, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) and CD40 (clone B-B20, Trinova Biochem, Gie\u00dfen, Germany) mAb, 100 ng/mL each, or with hkSE (1.25 105 CFU/mL; ade-, his-, SALMOVAC SE\u00ae, Impfstoffwerk Dessau-Tornau, Rosslau, cell vitality response of human PBMC to mAb or hkSE was evaluated by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT)-reduction test. cytokine levels were determined in culture media by commercially available ELISA kits for IL-1, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-, and TNF- (Op blood samples were collected and sera were separated by centrifuging the samples at 2,000 g/37\u00b0C for 10 min. the procedure was carried out according to the manufacturer's instruction. cDNA probes were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. real-time PCR Amplification of cDNA was performed on lightCycler. a 20-L reaction mixture including 4 L water, 2 L primers and 9 L DNA Master Mix was applied into the capillary. cDNA probes were treated with DNA-freeTM reagent (Ambion, Germany) to eliminate genomic DNA. cDNA probes were treated with DNA-freeTM reagent (Promega, Madison, USA) real-time PCR Amplification of cDNA was performed on LightCycler. a 20-L reaction mixture including 4 L water, 2 L primers, 9 L DNA Master Mix and 5 L (0.2 g) cDNA template was applied into the capillary and shortly centrifuged (3,000 g) the crossing point for each reaction was determined using the Second Derivative Maximum algorithm and the arithmetic baseline adjustment using the LightCycler software. data analysis was carried out in triplicates using Statistica 5.1 software. IL-12 profiles of human PBMC Profiling revealed that 24-hr exposure to Cd significantly decreased IL-12p70 release (p 0.01, Wilcoxon's test) at all tested doses from 0.5 to 50 ng/mL. cytokine levels tended to decrease with the increase in Cd levels as previously reported by our group. the increase in IL-12p70 levels revealed a strong negative correlation with Cd doses from 0.5 to 50 ng/mL. control cells activated by hkSE revealed IL-12p70 values ranged between 22 and 413 pg/mL (mean = 127) r values ranged from 0.93 to 0.97 and from 0.59 to 0.71 have been emerged indicating a strong positive correlation between levels of both cytokines. data represent the values of 12 and 10 donors in both panels respectively. serum profiles of IL-12p70 and IL-12p70 of all investigated donors were analyzed by CBA in sera of mice exposed intraperitoneally to Cd acetate or Hg chloride for 3 or 5 weeks. exposure to Cd for 5 weeks significantly increased the levels of serum IFN- that coincided with the increase in IL-12p70 levels. however, in 3 out of a total of 12 examined mice, both of IL-12p70 and IFN- were elevated comparable to control mice. control mice injected every other day for 3 weeks with isotonic saline solution (A) and following 3-week (B) or 5-week (C) exposure to cadmium acetate. cytokine content was evaluated by CBA as described in Materials and Methods. mRNA expression of IL-12p40, IL-4 and IFN- was significantly modified relative to control mice. exposure to IL-12p40 mRNA results in 14- and 684-fold increase in IFN- mRNA. exposure to Cd resulted in 15-fold decrease in IFN- mRNA expression. exposure to IL-4 mRNA caused 43- or 24-fold increase in IL-4 mRNA expression. mAb-stimulated PBMC revealed that 24-hr exposure to Cd significantly decreased IL-12p70 release (p 0.01, Wilcoxon's test) at all tested doses from 0.5 to 50 ng/mL. cytokine levels tended to decrease with the increase in Cd levels. control cells activated by hkSE revealed IL-12p70 values ranged between 22 and 413 pg/mL (mean = 127) results showed that IFN- levels increased significantly up to toxic doses, and then declined with the increase of Cd toxicity as recently reported. data represent the values of 12 and 10 donors in both panels. Symbols above each plot show whether cytokine release was significantly stimulated (#) or suppressed (*) compared to the controls. correlation between IL-12 and IFN- levels in vitro. serum profiles of IL-12p70 and IFN- analyzed by CBA in sera of mice exposed intraperitoneally to Cd acetate or Hg chloride for 3 or 5 weeks. serum profiles of IL-12p70 and IFN- analyzed by CBA in sera of mice exposed intraperitoneally to Cd acetate or Hg chloride. 70 were positively correlated to the up- or down-regulation of the Th1 cytokine IFN- (r = 0.81, p 0.01) and IL-5 (r value= -0.61, p 0.01); data not shown. exposure to Cd for 5 weeks significantly increased serum IFN-. but in 3 out of a total of 12 examined mice, both of IL-12p70 and IFN- were also elevated comparable to control mice. cytokine content was evaluated by CBA as described in Materials and Methods. exposure to Cd for 5 weeks resulted in a significant 74-fold increase in IL-12p40 gene expression. 5-week exposure to Hg decreased its expression 3 folds relative to controls. exposure to Cd resulted in 14- and 684-fold increase in IFN- mRNA. relative expression of IL-12p40 mRNA was positively correlated to that of IFN- mRNA (r value = 0.98, p 0.001) in case of Hg-exposed mice, 5-week exposition yielded 15-fold decrease. cytokines were quantified by ELISA, CBA, and RT-PCR. these metals exert a modulatory effect at the pre-transcriptional stages of cytokine production. RT-PCR is quantitative as well, but only using other reference house-keeping gene. the wide calibration range of the PBA offers a great ease of performance. compared with ELISA, the wide calibration range of the PBA offers a great flexibility. infection models of Listeria, Leishmania, Schistosoma and Toxoplasma inferred that IL-12 induced Th1 immune responses and inhibited Th2 cells differentiation. IL-12 induced the synthesis of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- [47]; TNF- implicated in mediating the effects of IL-12 on NK cells. a gondii was not accompanied by a compensatory Th2 response [55] neither the depletion of IFN- in IL-12 KO mice nor the neutralization of IL-12 in IFN- R KO mice affected the corona virus-elicited type 1 cytokine pattern. bacterially-stimulated DC can not produce IL-12 unless the cultures also contain other cells or cytokines such as IFN- [59] IL-12 may dominate IL-12 as a relevant indicator for heavy metal-induced immune modulation. the association of modulating Th cell differentiation and IL-12 levels support the use of this cytokine as a target for therapeutic approaches to re-establish a normal balance that may modify Th1- or Th2-dependent diseases. \u00f6rg Lehmann has kindly provided the Salmonella strain used in this study.
