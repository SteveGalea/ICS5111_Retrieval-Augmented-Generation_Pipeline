{"summary": "the primary target cell for HPAI H5N1 virus in human lung is the alveolar epithelial cell. alveolar epithelium and its adjacent lung microvascular endothelium form host barriers to the initiation of infection and dissemination of influenza H5N1 infection. HPAI H5N1 virus was a more potent inducer of cytokines (e.g. IP-10, RANTES, IL-6) in comparison to H1N1 virus in alveolar epithelial cells. these virus-induced chemokines were secreted onto both the apical and basolateral aspects of the polarized alveolar epithelium. alveolar epithelial cells cover over 80% of the alveolar surface. this large thin surface makes them extremely susceptible to injury from inhaled pathogens. there is no information of the effect of cell polarity on H5N1 virus replication or on virus-induced host responses. both influenza H1N1 and H5N1 viruses efficiently infect alveolar epithelial cells from both apical and basolateral surface of the epithelium. both viruses were preferentially released at the apical surface of the alveolar epithelium. the cell population was purified by a combination of differentiated cell attachment. the cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37\u00b0C) under liquid-covered conditions. a concomitant increase in transepithelial electrical resistance was measured using an epithelial tissue voltohmmeter (EVOM) culture and polarization of lung microvascular endothelial cell Primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVE) were purchased from Lonza Walkersville, Inc. (US) and maintained in the medium and growth supplements supplied by the manufacturer (EGM-2) the cells were seeded in the apical compartment of a 0.4 m pore size transwell support (Corning) with a cell density of 5 105 cells/cm2. polarized type I-like alveolar epithelial cells and HLMVE were seeded on the apical surface of the transwell membrane. during basolateral infection, 80 l of virus was added onto the transwell membrane with the transwell oriented upside down. the orientation of the transwell was resumed at 1 h after virus inoculation. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA with Oligo-dT primers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and quantified by real-time quantitative PCR analysis with a lightCycler (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) the gene expression profile for cytokines (interferon beta (IFN-), IL-6) and chemokines (IP-10, RANTES) and viral matrix gene were quantified and normalized using the housekeeping gene \u00b0C for 15 min then blocked with 3% H2O2 in TBS for 12 min. they were then incubated with 1:100 HRP conjugated Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), 1:100 biotinylated MAL-I and MAL-II (Vector) and Digoxigenin conjugated MAA (Roche) for 1 h at room temperature (RT), blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 10 min at resection in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Queen Mary Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong SAR. the cell population was purified by a combination of differentiated cell attachment, percoll density gradient centrifugation and magnetic cell sorting. the cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37\u00b0C) under liquid-covered conditions. cultures and polarization of lung microvascular endothelial cell Primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVE) were purchased from Lonza Walkersville, Inc. (US) and maintained in the medium and growth supplements supplied by the manufacturer (EGM-2) the cells were seeded in the apical compartment of a 0.4 m pore size transwell support (Corning) with a cell density of 5 105 cells/cm2. polarized type I-like alveolar epithelial cells and HLMVE were seeded on the apical surface of the transwell membrane. during basolateral infection, 80 l of virus was added onto the transwell membrane with the transwell oriented upside down. the orientation of the transwell in the apical infection situation was resumed at 1 h. mouse anti-influenza nucleoprotein and matrix antibody conjugated with FITC (DAKO Imagen, Dako Diagnostics Ltd, Ely, UK) and c) assaying infectious virus in cell culture supernatant by TCID50 assay to demonstrate complete virus replication. quantification of cytokine and chemokine mRNA by real-time quantitative RT-PCR DNase-treated mRNA from infected cells model was extracted at 1, 3, 6 and 24 the cells were microwaved in 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.0 at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min then blocked with 3% H2O2 in TBS for 12 min and with avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector) they were then incubated with 1:100 HRP conjugated Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), 1:100 biotinylated MAL-I and MAL-II (Roche) for 1 h at room polarized type I-like alveolar epithelial cell and HLMVE Lectin histochemistry on the primary culture of human type I-like alveolar epithelial cells using SNA and MAA. lectin histochemistry on the HLMVE cells shows binding of both SNA (Figure 2E) and MALII (Figure 2F) which agrees with previous reports. gene expression increased from 3 h to 24 h post infection (p 0.05) matrix gene copy number in type I-like alveolar epithelial cells infected with influenza A/HK/483/97 (H5N1) virus apically was higher than that of cells infected via the basolateral aspect. a representative immunofluorescence staining of type I-like alveolar epithelial cells after (A, D) mock, (B, E) influenza H1N1 and (C, F) H5N1 virus infection and (G) chart with percentage of infection. the immunofluoresecent staining of the type I-like alveolar epithelial cells after (A-C) and (D-F) infection at 24 h post infection respectively. titers of influenza H5N1 virus shed on the apical aspect of the cell were higher (p = 0.017) following influenza H5N1 virus infection. titer of the (A) A/HK/54/98 (H1N1) and (B) A/HK/483/97 (H5N1) was determined after apical infection. titer of the (A) A/HK/54/98 (H1N1) and (B) A/HK/483/97 (H5N1) was determined after apical infection. apical release after basolateral infection, Ba = basolateral release after basolateral infection, Bb = basolateral release after basolateral infection. differences between influenza H5N1 and H1N1 viruses achieved statistical significance with IFN following apical (p 0.05) and basolateral (p 0.01) infection (Figure 7A), IL-6 following apical infection (p 0.01) and IP-10 following basolateral infection (p 0.05) similar cytokine and chemokine expression profiles were observed at 3 h and 6 h post infection in influenza virus infected type I-like alveolar epithelial cells cytokine (A) IFN-, (B) IL-6 and chemokine (C) RANTES, (D) IP-10 gene expression from type I-like alveolar epithelial cell after apical (black) and basolateral (grey) influenza A virus infection at 24 h post infection. we failed to detect any IFN proteins in the supernatant of type I-like alveolar epithelial cells after influenza virus infection. the limit of detection of the IFN ELISA was high (250 pg/ml) but this lack of sensitivity of the assay is likely to be responsible for this lack of detection. the lectin histochemistry on the HLMVE cells shows binding of both SNA (Figure 2E) and MALII (Figure 2F) which agrees with previous reports [15]. polarized type I-like alveolar epithelial cells and HLMVEs. viral matrix (M) gene expression in copy number normalized with -actin gene expression (105 copies) during infection of human primary type I-like alveolar epithelial cells infected (MOI = 2) with influenza (A) A/HK/54/98 (H1N1) and (B) A/HK/483/97 (H5N1) virus. apical (A-C) and basolateral (D-F) infection at 24 h post infection respectively. asterisk indicates statistically significant difference with p 0.05 and p 0.01 respectively. TCID50 assay was performed on the supernatant collected from the infected type I-like alveolar epithelial cells. the titers of influenza H5N1 virus at the apical aspect of the cells are significantly more seen with H1N1 infected cells. single and double asterisk indicates statistically significant difference with p 0.05 and p 0.01, respectively. single and double asterisk indicates statistically significant difference with p 0.05 and p 0.01 respectively. expression of cytokine and chemokine in type I-like alveolar epithelial cell. similar cytokine and chemokine expression profiles were observed at 3 h and 6 h post infection in influenza virus infected type I-like alveolar epithelial cells. inactivation of the virus by ultraviolet irradiation prior to infection of the type I-like alveolar epithelial cells abolished cytokine induction. even an increase in the MOI of influenza H1N1 virus up to 5 did not result in the cytokine expression level the concentrations of the IP-10, RANTES and IFN were measured by ELISA in apical and basolateral culture supernatants of type I-like alveolar epithelial cells. influenza H5N1 virus induced IP-10 protein secretion was found on the apical side of the polarized type I-like alveolar epithelial cells. this level was significantly higher than the mock infected cells (p 0.01) and influenza H1N the lack of sensitivity of the assay is likely to be responsible for this lack of detection. we compared human influenza H1N1 virus with a highly pathogenic influenza H5N1 virus. the basolateral aspect of the alveolar epithelium lies in close proximity to the basolateral aspect of the lung microvascular endothelial cells. the polarity of influenza virus infection and release have only been studied with low pathogenic influenza A virus (subtype H3N2) and low pathogenic avian influenza A virus (subtype H5N3 and H4N6) [21] in human airway trachea-bronchial epithelial cells. the mouse-adapted influenza H1N1 virus (WSN strain) and sendi virus have been shown to bud from the basolateral domain of polarized cells. this is expected since respiratory viruses need to be adapted to efficiently infect cells via the apical surface. release of newly formed virus was restricted to the apical aspect, irrespective of whether the alveolar epithelial cells were infected by the apical or basolateral route. this is expected with a virus that appears not to disseminate beyond the lung. replication is likely to lead to weakening of tight-junctions and to cell death. replication within the basolateral aspect of the alveoli could lead to viremia and dissemination of infection. the fact that HPAI H5N1 virus H0 precursor form can be cleaved by proteases not restricted to the lung. lining interstitial cells may then be exposed to the alveolar lumen fluid which contains high concentrations of virus. alveolar basement membrane with denuded alveolar epithelial cell will accelerate epithelial proliferation until the epithelial layer becomes confluent. previous reports on human lung epithelial cell line A549 infected with human influenza H3N2 virus showed a low production of interferons. the secretion of chemokines was found in influenza H5N1 virus infected type I-like alveolar epithelial cell but not in influenza H1N1 virus infected cell. the basolateral release of chemotactic IP-10 from the influenza virus infected type I-like alveolar epithelial cells recruit lymphocytes from the capillary circulation into alveoli. cytokine secreting macrophages accumulate within the alveoli. further augmentation of the cytokine and chemokine cascades may result. clearance of the virus and lung inflammation would take longer than with seasonal influenza infection. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions MCWC, RWYC and JSMP conceived the study and planned the overall experimental design."}
