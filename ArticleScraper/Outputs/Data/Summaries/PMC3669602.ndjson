{"summary": "TBEV is a member of the genus Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae. it causes tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in humans. TBEV is prevalent over a wide area of Eurasia, including Europe, Russia, far Eastern Asia, and Japan. the virus was identified as the Far Eastern subtype of TBEV after nucleotide sequence analysis. no TBE case has been reported on Hokkaido since the first case. endemic foci of TBEV were maintained in Hokuto until recently. each of 10\u201313 1-day-old suckling mice was inoculated intracerebrally with 20 L of the inoculum. the mice were observed daily for 14 days, and a moribund mouse was killed and stored at 80\u00b0C. phylogenetic analysis was performed using the complete E gene sequences of the TBEV strains, including strains isolated in Hokkaido. the tree was constructed using 1488 nucleotides of the viral E gene and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV) as the outgroup. animal model Viruses were inoculated subcutaneously into 5-week-old female C57BL/6J mice. Morbidity was defined as a >10% weight loss. mice were monitored for 28 days postinfection to determine survival curves. Homogenates from 3\u20135 rodents of the same rodent species pooled and used as the inocula. each of 10\u201313 1-day-old suckling mice was inoculated intracerebrally with 20 L of the inoculum. phylogenetic analysis was performed using the complete E gene sequences of the TBEV strains, including strains isolated in Hokkaido. the tree was constructed using 1488 nucleotides of the viral E gene and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus as the outgroup. the cells were inoculated with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 plaque forming unit (pfu) cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. the supernatant was harvested 12, 24, 36, and 48 h postinoculation and stored in aliquots at 80\u00b0C. immunohistochemical detection of TBEV was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against E protein (Yoshii et al. 2004). results Isolation and identification of TBEV in Hokuto One suckling mouse became sick after inoculation with 1 group of spleen homogenates of an Apodemus speciosus captured in Hokuto. the brain homogenate of this mouse was inoculated into BHK cells to confirm the isolation of TBEV the sequence of Oshima 08-As was compared with that of the Oshima 5\u201310 strain isolated from a dog in 1995 in Hokuto. the sequence of Oshima 08-As was compared with that of the Oshima 5\u201310 strain isolated from a dog in 1995. ly 7587, 7589 g, t Gly a, c Ser 7616 c Phe t Phe 7898 NS5 t Val g Val 7966 a Lys g Arg 8462 t Val c Val 8615 a Lys g Arg 10300 c Thr a Lys 10476 3\u2032-UTR a \u2014 g \u2014 10823 a \u2014 g \u2014 108 mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 102 to 106 plaque-forming units (pfu) of each virus and were monitored for 28 days. all mice infected with each dose of Oshima 08-As showed general signs of illness, such as a hunched posture, ruffled fur, and general malaise. 03.0 100 (5/5) 60 (3/5) 11.81.3 16.01.0 105 100 (5/5) 60 (3/5) 8.80.8 16.05.3 60 (3/5) 40 (2/5) 10.82.9 12.01.4 106 100 (5/5) 100 (5/5) 7.60.6 10.42.3 80 (4/5) 20 (1/5) 11.51.7 15 a Morbidity of mice was estimated by >10% of weight loss. titers in spleen (A) and brain (B) at the indicated days after infection were determined using plaque assays. Error bars represent the standard deviation (SD) (n=3) TBEV-specific products were amplified by RT-PCR from cells infected with the brain homogenate of a sick mouse. TBEV-infected (lane 2) and mock-treated (lane 3) cells were used as positive and negative controls. a phylogenetic tree of the TBEV strains was determined.

BHK cells were infected with TBEV at a MOI of 0.01. pathogenicity of Oshima 08-As was examined in a mouse model. mice infected with Oshima 08-As and Oshima 5\u201310 were inoculated subcutaneously with 102 to 106 plaque-forming units (pfu) of each virus. a morbidity of mice was estimated by >10% of weight loss. mice were infected with 1000 pfu of Oshima 08-As or Oshima 5\u201310. viremia was barely observed in both of the mice infected with each virus. similar transient multiplication in the spleen was observed in the mice infected with each virus. the virus titer in the brain was 3.8106 pfu/mL. the viral load in the brain was 4.2105 pfu/mL. TBEV antigens were detected using E protein-specific antibodies. all amino acid changes were located in the NS proteins. the genetic stability of the viral structural proteins may be important for transmission in wild rodents and ticks. TBEV strains co-circulate among attenuated strains in endemic areas of japan. no human TBE cases have been reported in the endemic area since 1993."}
