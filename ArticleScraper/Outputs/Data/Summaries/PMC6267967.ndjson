{"summary": "sporotrichosis is a mycosis affecting humans and animals globally. it is caused by different members of the Sporothrix schenckii species complex. the most prevalent etiological agent and the primary pathogen of feline sporotrichosis in Brazil is S. brasiliensis. the occurrence of cats with different clinical forms of sporotrichosis suggests other factors may be involved in the disease presentation of feline sporotrichosis. the diagnosis of FIV infection in cats is often based on the ELISA detection of antibodies against viral proteins such as p24. the cats with sporotrichosis tested for retrovirus co-infection were mainly from Rio de Janeiro, where available resources do not allow confirmation of infection by Western blot or PCR. the co-infection with FIV or FeLV is related to changes in immunological parameters among cats with sporotrichosis. 2 mL of blood were transferred to a tube containing EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) for qPCR and RT-qPCR. 3 mL were transferred to a tube containing heparin for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolation and flow cytometry. 1 mL was transferred to a tube without anticoagulants (serum for ELISA and Western blot) serum was tested by ELISA for FIV antibodies using recombinant TM- ELISA. samples that reached an OD value > 50% of the positive control were considered positive. no clinical improvement was observed for two consecutive appointments. the mRNA was purified with mRNA Isolation Kit I and the Magna Pure LC Instrument. for all extractions performed, 100 L of phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) was used as negative control. for each sample of mRNA, the cDNA was synthesized in duplicate and pooled. PBMC pellets were resuspended in freezing medium with 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich), 50% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS, Hyclone\u2013USA) and 40% RPMI 1640 (Roswell Park Memorial Institute\u2014Sigma\u2013Aldrich) stored in liquid nitrogen. aliquots of PBMC were incubated for 30 minutes, at 4\u00b0C, with 5 l of one of the antibody/combination of antibodies unlabeled samples were employed as negative controls for non-specific binding. cells were washed twice by centrifugation with HBSS and resuspended in 200 L of HBSS for acquisition on the flow cytometer. data were collected from 10,000 cells and are expressed as percentages of positive cells inside the gate. sporotrichosis was confirmed by isolation and identification of Sporothrix spp. the cats included in the study were divided into three groups according to distribution of skin lesions: L1, L2 and L3. heparinized blood samples, PBMC samples and serum samples were stored at -80\u00b0C, liquid Nitrogen and at -20\u00b0C. cats were followed up on an outpatient basis at the LAPCLIN/DERMZOO. the criteria for clinical cure or therapeutic failure were previously described by Reis et al. the presence of FeLV p27 antigen in the plasma was determined using a sandwich ELISA. results were represented as percentages of a defined positive control. samples that reached an OD value > 50% of the positive control signal were considered positive. cDNA was synthesized using the high-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit. for each sample of mRNA, the cDNA was synthesized in duplicate and pooled. levels of transcription of the V-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene and zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ) were employed for normalization. the PBMC were quickly thawed at 37\u00b0C and then resuspended in 10 mL of complete medium (1x RPMI 1640 medium\u2014Sigma-Aldrich, Zug, Switzerland) the solution was centrifuged (560 x g, 10 minutes), the cells were washed once in 10 mL of 1x HBSS (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, Sigma-Aldrich) the population of lymphocytes was defined on the basis of their size and granularity. data were collected from 10,000 cells and are expressed as percentages of positive cells inside the gate. the following categorical variables were used to group the cats for further analyses. samples that reached an OD value > 50% of the positive control signal were considered positive. the serum was tested by ELISA for FIV antibodies using recombinant FIV-Z2 transmembrane glycoprotein (TM- ELISA) as described elsewhere. the cDNA was synthetized in duplicate and pooled according to manufacturer's instructions. for each sample of mRNA, the cDNA was synthetized in duplicate and pooled. levels of transcription of the V-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (ABL) and zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ) were employed for normalization. three aliquots of PBMC were incubated for 30 minutes, at 4\u00b0C. cells were washed twice by centrifugation with HBSS and resuspended in 200 L of HBSS for acquisition on the flow cytometer. the population of lymphocytes was defined on the basis of their size and granularity. data were collected from 10,000 cells and are expressed as percentages of positive cells inside the gate. the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.0. six (20.0%) were between 2 and five years old ( 2 5 years) and seven (23.3%) were more than five years old (>5 years). none of the cats was double-positive for FeLV and FIV. all cases that tested positive for FIV antibodies by ELISA tested also positive by FIV Western-blot. no significant differences were found among cats in groups L1, L2 and L3 in cytokine transcription in any of the tested cytokines. it was not possible to compare the cytokine levels among cats with no retrovirus co-infection according to their general condition. IL-10 was significantly higher in both cats with progressive FeLV infection (PMWU = 0.04) and in FIV-positive cats (PMWU = 0.05) there were no significant differences in the lymphocyte subsets among the cats in groups L1, L2 and L3. clinical follow-up Based on data collected from the medical records, 24 cats were followed up until treatment outcome. four retrovirus-negative cats and one cat with progressive FeLV infection were lost to follow-up. four (80.0%) were in good general condition, three (10.0%) in fair general condition and three (10.0%) in poor general condition. fourteen cats (46.7%) were under 2 years old, (2 years), six (20.0%) were between 2 and five years old. none of the cats was double-positive for FeLV and FIV. retrovirus-negative cats were co-infected with either FeLV (progressive infection) or FIV. no significant differences were found in cytokine transcription in any of the tested cytokines. IL-10 was significantly higher in both cats with progressive FeLV infection (PMWU = 0.04) and in FIV-positive cats (PMWU = 0.05) there were no significant differences in lymphocyte subsets among the cats in groups L1, L2 and L3. FIV-positive cats presented lower percentages of CD4+ cells (PMWU = 0.04), higher percentages of CD8+ cells (PMWU0.01) and lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio. four retrovirus-negative cats and one cat with progressive FeLV infection were lost to follow-up. this is the first study to assess cytokine transcription in the blood of cats with sporotrichosis. previous studies have not established a correlation between severe sporotrichosis and feline retrovirus co-infections. there was also a low incidence of FeLV and FIV infected cats. PCR is a more sensitive measure for FeLV exposure than antigen detection. in the current study, only one cat had a regressive FeLV-infection. a subsequent reactivation of the viremia cannot be ruled out. IL-10 was significantly increased in cats with sporotrichosis co-infected with either FIV or FeLV, leading to a potential immunosuppressive condition. IL-10 is also reported to suppress cellular immune response by inhibiting cytokine production by Th1 cells and activated macrophages. the levels of IL-6, a cytokine which induces the development of Th17 cells, did not differ among the cats from this study. this suggests that retrovirus co-infection and the upregulation of IL-10, with a potential polarization to a Treg cell profile, did not impair Th17 immunity. despite having opposite functions, Th17 and Treg cells develop from CD4+ cell precursors through the same pathway. cytokine changes in cats with sporotrichosis coinfected with FIV may be at some level linked to the large number of yeast commonly found in cutaneous lesions of feline sporotrichosis. however, further work is required to address these issues properly. the findings are consistent with what has been reported for FIV infection. cats with severe sporotrichosis clearly outnumbered retrovirus co-infected cats. the retrovirus co-infection with upregulation of IL-10 is possibly involved with the impairment of granuloma formation and increasing fungal load in lesions of feline sporotrichosis. retrovirus/sporothrix co-infection in cats led to important changes in immunological balance, leaning towards an immunosuppressive profile with higher levels of IL-10. this could prevent the activation of a Th1 response that would be favourable against sporotrichosis. these results encourage the development of prospective longitudinal studies that address the impact of immunological changes in the outcome of cats with sporotrichosis. this would be the key to better understand prognostic determinants of feline sporotrichosis and to developing new therapy strategies to control disease spread."}
