{"summary": "the majority of URIs are of viral etiology, but definitive diagnosis can be difficult due to the overlapping clinical presentations of viral and bacterial infections. the rapid and sensitive detection of respiratory viruses is essential for the early diagnosis and administration of appropriate antiviral therapy. bioFire FA-RP Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from patients with symptomatic respiratory tract infection and processed with FA-RP. the assay detects nucleic acids of 17 respiratory viruses and 3 bacteria, including adenovirus (Adv), coronaviruses (HCoV: OC43, NL63, 229E and HKU1), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV or RSV), human metapneumovirus the extraction, amplification, and detection steps take place in separate chambers of a self-contained, single-use pouch. results 3.1. spectrum of respiratory pathogens detected Among 656 respiratory samples tested, 356/656 (54.3%) were positive and 300/656 (45.7%) were negative. HRV, Adv and influenza viruses (A and B) were the most usual isolated pathogens. avirus (all types), and influenza (A and B), (14/147, 9.5%) each, Hmpv (12/147, 8.2%) and PIV (1, 2, and 3), 9 (6.1%) in the age-group (5, 10), HRV was identified in 25/80 samples (31.3%), Adv in 18/80 (22.5%), influenza (A and B) in 11 (13.8%), and Hmpv in 6/80 (7.5%). most cases of coronavirus (all types included) were detected in children 10 years old (28 out of 35 cases, 80%), 10 of which (28.6%) were in children (2). HRV participated in most multiple isolations, being the most frequent isolated pathogen (37/57, 64.9%) negative samples were mostly encountered to older ages. in the age group (2), 33 out of 121 patients (27.3%) revealed no pathogen. the same was true for 42/147 (28.6%) patients in the age group (2, 5), 21/80 (26.3%) in the age group (5, 10), 12/22 (54.5%) in the age group (10, 18), 89/135 (65.9%) in the age group (18, 45), 56/78 (71.8%) in the age group (45, 65 37 out of 147 samples (25.2%), followed by HRV (29/147, 19.7%), RSV (16/147, 16.9%), coronavirus (all types), and influenza (A and B) in the age-group (5, 10), HRV was identified in 25/80 samples (31.3%), Adv in 18/80 (22.5%), influenza (A and B) in 11 (13.8%), and Hmpv in 6/80 (7.5%). inance of influenza in the age group (10, 18) was due to influenza B cases. the majority of cases with influenza A H1-2009 were observed in the ages under 10 years old (16/27, 59.3%) the latter was also true for Hmpv (27/39, 69.2%), while PIV-3, the main PIV type detected (Table 1) had a peak incidence in ages under 5 years old (15/19, 78.9%). negative samples were mostly encountered to older ages. in the age group (2), 33 out of 121 patients (27.3%) revealed no pathogen. in the age group (2), 33 out of 121 patients (27.3%) revealed no pathogen. the predominance of HRV in our patient series is in accordance with previously published data. Adv has been considered as the most frequent responsible pathogen in the age group (2, 5) and second in priority among all the identified pathogens. this was not confirmed in our study, where most positive samples were observed in ages under 5 years old. influenza A has been referred as the most common etiologic agent (55.7%), especially among adults. it has been proposed that the highest incidence of Hmpv infection is among children. 9% of all our respiratory patients had multiple pathogens and 16% of all positive respiratory patients. there is no obvious explanation about the significance of lower frequency of co-detection in our series of patients. author contributions Conceptualization: Nikolaos J.
