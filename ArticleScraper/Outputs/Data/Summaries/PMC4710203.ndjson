{"summary": "RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 receptor (MDA5) form the apex of the RLR signaling cascade. all three are expressed ubiquitously, but only RIG-I and MDA5 possess N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) that are capable of downstream immune signal transduction. adaptor proteins include TANK and NF-B essential modulator. this facilitates interactions between TBK1, inhibitor of NF-B kinase subunit (IKK) and TRAFs. Upon RLR activation, these proteins are colocalized at the cytosolic surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane. the RIG-I CARDs undergo tetramerization upon K63-linked polyubiquitination or unanchored polyubiquitin chain association. ubiquitination has no known role in ubiquitination. ubiquitin-specific protease 3 (USP3) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase are DUbs that inhibit IFN-I production by removing such chains from RIG-I. ubiquitin modifications that up-regulate or down-regulate IFN-I expression are shown in blue circles. RNF135 and TRIM25 share a similar RING-CCD-B30.2/SPRY (sp1A and ryanodine receptors) domain organization. however, the CCDs differ in size and sequence markedly, suggesting that IAV-NS1 may bind multiple sites on TRIM25 and RNF135. RNF125 ubiquitinates and degrades activated MAVS (Arimoto et al., 2007), suggesting that RNF125 is an E3 that destabilizes proteins containing activated CARDs. however, the properties of p52rIPK or RNF125 may be exploitable in the treatment of viral infections or autoimmune disorders. HOIP promotes M1- and K48-linked polyubiquitination of TRIM25. TRIM25 induces proteasomal degradation, thereby decreasing TRIM25-mediated activation of RIG-I. only RIG-I and MDA5 possess N-terminal caspase activation domains. IFN- regulate transcription of hundreds of ISGs during infection. TBK1 associates with RIG-I as well as key adaptor proteins. TBK1 localization changes from the cytosol to distinct subcellular compartments. transduction to transcription factors (orange) through PTM of signaling cascade proteins. other regulatory proteins (gray) support or sequester these signaling proteins. other regulatory proteins (gray) support or sequester these signals. ubiquitination has no known role in MDA5 or LGP2 activation. the first virus-triggered RIG-I ubiquitination site described, K172, depends on the E3 activity of tripartite motif protein 25. TRIM4 was recently described to modify this same site. both TRIM25 and RNF135 are targets of the influenza A virus (IAV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). IAV-NS1 binds the central coiled-coil domain (CCD) of TRIM25 and is postulated to prevent CCD-mediated homo-oligomerization. numerous herpesviruses encode their own DUbs that inhibit IFN-I expression by stripping ubiquitin modifications from activated RIG-I. ubiquitin in return to homeostasis RLR signaling is counterbalanced and diminished through ubiquitin modification as the antiviral posture becomes unnecessary. the properties of p52rIPK or RNF125 may be exploitable in the treatment of viral infections or autoimmune disorders. the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) was proposed to negatively regulate RLR-mediated IFN-I expression via two independent mechanisms. cGAS signals via STING and AIM2 generates inflammasome oligomers. cGAS signals via STING and AIM2 generates inflammasome oligomers. RNA-activated RIG-I and MDA5 colocalize with MAVS. TRIM25 ubiquitinates MAVS at Lys7 and Lys10 and induces its partial proteolysis. TRIM25 ubiquitinates MAVS at Lys7 and Lys10 and induces its partial proteolysis. MARCH5 is an important regulator of mitochondrial fission and fusion. MAVS degradation is independently promoted by the E3s RNF5, RNF125, atrophin-1\u2013interacting protein 4 (AIP4; also termed ITCH), SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) and Smurf2. the adjacent residues Lys371 and Lys420 are polyubiquitinated by AIP4 upon recruitment by poly(rC)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) or PCBP2. at least seven E3s ubiquitinate MAVS, leading to MAVS degradation in almost every case. at least five of these modify other substrates within the same cascade. TRIM25 ubiquitinates MAVS at Lys7 and Lys10 and induces its partial proteolysis. membrane-associated RING finger protein 5 (MARCH5) polyubiquitinates MAVS at Lys362 and Lys461. the adjacent residues Lys371 and Lys420 are polyubiquitinated by AIP4 upon recruitment by poly(rC)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) or PCBP2. NEDD4 family\u2013interacting protein 1 (Ndfip1) binds MAVS and recruits Smurf1 and possibly Smurf2. numerous TRAFs, including TRAF3 and TRAF6, interact with MAVS. TRAF ubiquitination orients immune signal transmission. TRAF3 promotes IFN-I expression by activating TBK1/IRF3. TRAF6 activates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 to activate NF-B. however, cIAP1/2 can also activate TRAF3 by catalyzing its K63-linked polyubiquitination. the context-dependent ubiquitination state of cIAP1/2 determines its effect on TRAF3 and TRAF6. the E3 RNF166 was recently reported to ubiquitinate and activate both TRAF3 and TRAF6. the DUb UL36USP strips K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from TRAF3. at least five members have emerging roles in antiviral immune signaling. NOD1, NOD2, NLRC5 (NLR family CARD domain\u2013containing protein 5), NLRP4 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain\u2013containing protein 4) and NLRX1 (NLR family member X1; Fig. 2, right) NOD2 signaling is further suppressed by AIP4, which ubiquitinates Lys209 of receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2 (RIPK2), the immediate downstream interacting partner of NOD2. Conversely, NOD2-driven NF-B activation is enhanced by LUBAC, a negative regulator of RLR signaling, as well as X-linked IAP (XIAP) NLRC5 has also been shown to bind and inhibit TBK1-mediated IFN- induction in HEK-293T cells. NLRC5/ mice show relatively normal cytokine responses upon exposure to RLR-, TLR- and NLR-activating stimuli. PRRs NOD1 and NOD2 are the best characterized NLRs. NOD1 is expressed ubiquitously, while NOD2 is expressed in cells of myeloid and lymphoid origin. NOD2 promotes IFN-I expression during infection by RNA viruses. NF-B activation is enhanced by LUBAC, a negative regulator of RLR signaling, as well as X-linked IAP (XIAP) these activating ubiquitin chains may be antagonized by the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 (Hitotsumatsu et al., 2008), which disrupts ubiquitin-mediated TBK1 activation in the RLR signaling cascade as well as ubiquitin-mediated TRAF6 activ NLRC5/ mice show relatively normal cytokine responses upon exposure to RLR-, TLR-, and NLR-activating stimuli. ubiquitination plays an uncharacterized role in regulating NLRC5. NLRP4 has gained prominence as another negative regulator of multiple immune signaling pathways that is more widely expressed than NLRC5. LR8, and TLR9 are expressed in endosomal vesicles. TLR3 recognizes ssRNA, up-regulating TBK1/IRF3-dependent IFN-I expression. TLR9 recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) DNA. KK and IKK priming them for full transactivation through autophosphorylation. phosphorylates the IB subunit, leading to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. TBK1 polyubiquitination by Nrdp1 activates TBK1 in TRIF-mediated IFN-I expression. ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 inhibits ubiquitin-mediated activation of TRAF6. additional avenues of signaling cross-talk include Smurf1 and Smurf2. TRAF6 itself promotes proinflammatory cytokine production at the expense of IFN-I. coma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes replication and transcription factor (RTA) this activation process involves suppression of antiviral cytokines. NF-B activation and IFN-I up-regulation TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 signaling is mediated through the adaptor protein myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88. TBK1 polyubiquitination by Nrdp1 activates TBK1 in TRIF-mediated IFN-I expression. ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 inhibits ubiquitin-mediated activation of TRAF6 via the TLR and NLR cascades. signaling cross-talk include Smurf1 and Smurf2, which degrade MAVS and inhibit IFN-I activation. cIAP2 is an E3 that targets TRAF3 for degradation. this is important in promoting TLR4-mediated signaling and cytokine production at the expense of type I IFN production. IRFs transmit danger signals into the nucleus TLR, NLR, and RLR IFN-I signaling converges at IRF activation. IRF3 is constitutively expressed in most cell types, residing inactive in the cytosol until phosphorylation by TBK1/IKK within two activation clusters (Ser385/Ser386 and Ser396/Ser398/Ser402/Thr404/Ser405) SUMO-conjugating enzyme ubiquitin carrier protein 9 protects IRF3 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation by occupying these sites with SUMO. TRIM26 is an E3 that conjugates K48-linked polyubiquitin chains to these same sites, triggering degradation of the active, nuclear-localized form of IRF3. TRIM21 is a ubiquitin E3 described to both inhibit the IRF3-Pin1 interaction and target IRF3 for proteasomal degradation. the TRIM21-dependent IRF3/IFR7 ubiquitin acceptor sites remain undefined. CK1, TRIM21, TRIM26, and HERC5 are IFN-I inducible. roV nonstructural protein 1 blocks NF-B signaling and usurps ubiquitin modification system to redirect IRF3/5/7/9 to proteasome in a strain-specific manner. viral infectivity factor (Vif) and viral protein R (Vpr) hijacked for this purpose are unknown. Vif and Vpr recruit SCF-related components to degrade other antiviral proteins. ubiquitin is an IRF master toggle. lating enzyme sentrin-specific protease 2 (SENP2) removes SUMO from IRF3. TRIM26 is an E3 that conjugates K48-linked polyubiquitin chains to these same sites. activated IRF3 undergoes phosphorylation at Ser339. IRF3/IFR7 ubiquitin acceptor sites remain undefined. a number of additional E3s regulate IRF abundance. the forkhead box protein O1 (RBCK1) catalyzes IRF3 degradation. a cornerstone of this dynamic regulatory framework is the ubiquitin modification system, which is manipulated by viruses relevant to human disease. a cornerstone of this dynamic regulatory framework is the ubiquitin modification system, which is manipulated by viruses relevant to human disease. ubiquitin modification will expose further cross-talk between the immune signaling cascades, revealing a functional and self-regulating whole. humans possess hundreds of specific- and general-effect E3s and DUbs."}
