{"summary": "OROV has a trisegmented genome, comprised of three single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments. L encodes the viral RNA polymerase, M encodes the viral surface glycoproteins (Gc and Gn) and a nonstructural protein (NSm) the receptors of OROV remain uncharacterized, although Gc is implicated in host cell attachment. OROV has caused periodic outbreaks of a debilitating febrile illness since the 1960s. more than 30 epidemics and 500,000 infected people in Brazil, Peru, Trinidad, Panama, and suriname (9\u201311) most patients with Oropouche fever recover within 2 to 3 weeks of initial infection without long-term sequelae. symptoms can persist for months and, surprisingly, relapses are common (12). despite its potential for further geographical spread, little is known about OROV pathogenesis. type I interferon (IFN) signaling network is essential for antiviral defense. it has a pivotal role in age-dependent mortality in mice (25) IRF-3- and IRF-7-dependent transcription contributes to the control of LACV infection in vivo (40), as their combined deficiency resulted in more rapid death (40, 41). a deficiency of MAVS paradoxically resulted in an improved clinical outcome after LACV infection (40), suggesting that under certain circumstances MAVS-dependent signaling may cause neuronal pathogenesis in vivo. the LACV strain (original strain) was provided generously by Andrew Pekosz (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA) and passaged twice in vero cells to produce a virus stock. the titer of LACV was calculated as 2.7 107 FFU/ml using the monoclonal antibodies. all infections were performed by subcutaneous injection in the footpad with 106 FFU of OROV and 105 or 106 FFU of LACV in a volume of 50 l. all animals were monitored for survival and weight loss for 21 days. infected cells were detected after incubation with a 1:1,000 dilution of polyclonal mouse anti-OROV ascites fluid (ATCC VR-1228AF) the samples were incubated with 300 l of a 1:2,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. mice from each group (WT, Ifnar/, Mavs/, and Irf7/ DKO) were infected with OROV. 4 days later liver and spleen were harvested, fixed in 4% PFA in PBS. the binding of primary antibody was detected using M.O.M. biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibody and a 1:300 dilution of streptavidin-peroxidase ultrasensitive polymer (Sigma) antigen staining was visualized using DAB (3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine) HRP substrate (Vector) and then counterstained with hematoxylin. primary mouse fibroblasts (MEFs) from WT, Ifnar/, Mavs/, Mda5/, or Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO mice were generated as described previously. M and DC cultures were produced as described previously (52). one-step qRT-PCR also confirmed OROV infection in these cells. all reactions were assembled in a final volume of 25 l with 300 ng of RNA. 1 PrimeTime mix (Integrated DNA Technologies) containing both primers and probe. qRT-PCR also confirmed OROV infection in these cells. the levels of secreted IFN- protein in supernatants of OROV-infected MEFs were measured by a commercial capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. qRT-PCR in 2fTGH-infected cells and U3A-infected (2fTGH-derived STAT1-deficient mutant cells) was expressed on a log10 scale as genome equivalents/sa. the levels of human IFNB, IFIT1 and GAPDH mRNA were determined after normalization to 18S levels and expressed on a log2 scale as fold increase over mock. all data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad Software) the titer of LACV was calculated as 2.7 107 FFU/ml. all injections with virus were performed under anesthesia with ketamine hydrochloride (80 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine (15 mg/kg) cells were collected from adult C57BL/6 WT (CD45.1) or Ifnar/ (CD45.2) mice. they were transferred adoptively (107 cells per animal) by retroorbital injection into 4-week-old 800-cGy-irradiated WT (CD45.1 or CD45.2) or Ifnar/ mice. eight weeks later, reconstitution was validated by flow cytometry. anti-OROV ascites fluid (ATCC VR-1228AF) in a volume of 50 l for 2 h at room temperature. the samples were incubated with 50 l of a 1:2,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. dUTP-biotin nick end labeling staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining of paraffin-embedded tissues were performed using a POD in situ cell death detection kit. sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and treated for antigen retrieval. antigen staining was visualized using DAB (3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine) HRP substrate (Vector) and then counterstained with hematoxylin. serum was collected and cytokine levels were analysed using the bio-Rad. MEFs from Rig-I/ mice and their WT controls were a gift from Michael Gale (Seattle, WA). M and DC cultures were produced as described previously (52). Bone marrow was isolated from mice and cultured for 7 days in medium. multistep virus growth curves were performed at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. all reactions were assembled in a final volume of 25 l with 300 ng of RNA. 1 PrimeTime mix (Integrated DNA Technologies) containing both primers and probe. 12.5 l of TaqMan master mix (Applied Biosystems) were assembled in a final volume of 25 l with 300 ng of RNA. the levels of secreted IFN- protein in supernatants of OROV-infected MEFs were measured by a commercial capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) cells were harvested at 1, 4, 12, 24, and 36 h after infection. levels of viral RNA were measured by qRT-PCR as described above. all primers and probes were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. all data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad Software) for viral burden analysis, the log titers were analyzed. OROV infection of 6-week-old Ifnar/ mice resulted in 100% mortality. 6-week-old WT mice did not show disease signs or weight loss compared to uninfected animals. however, signs of neuroinvasive disease, including limb paralysis, ataxia, seizures, or sustained tremors, were not apparent in OROV-infected mice. survival analysis of 6-week-old mice after inoculation with 106 PFU of OROV by subcutaneous injection in the footpad. asterisks indicate differences statistically significant compared to WT mice by the log rank test. the weight loss curves were compared using 2-way ANOVA. surviving animals gained weight more slowly than uninfected mice. surviving animals gained weight more slowly than uninfected mice. OROV replicates preferentially in the liver, spleen, and blood of mice lacking intact type I IFN signaling. we measured viral burden in the serum, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, brain, and spinal cord. by day 4 after infection, high levels of OROV were recovered from the liver and spleen of all Ifnar/ and Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO mice. f3/ Irf7/ DKO mice in the liver and spleen at day 6 after infection. tissue viral burden in Ifnar/, Mavs/, and Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO mice was measured by focus-forming assay. data points represent individual mice. bars indicate median values and were obtained from 8 to 15 mice per time point. blood chemistry reveals extensive liver injury in KO mice after OROV infection. alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased levels of ALT (7,307 U/liter, 601 U/liter, and 7,164 U/liter, respectively, compared to 111 U/liter in infected WT mice. blood chemistry reveals extensive liver injury after OROV infection. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (A), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (B) and glucose (GLU) levels were measured from serum samples of WT and Ifnar/, Mavs/, and Irf3/ Irf7/ mice (n = 8 to 13 for each group) Necropsy revealed gross macroscopic tissue damage in the liver of Ifnar/ and Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO mice. this was characterized by visible hemorrhages and tissue discoloration in several animals. hematoxylin and eosin staining of paraffin sections revealed areas of focal cellular necrosis within the liver of Ifnar/ and Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO but not in Mavs/ or WT mice small foci of OROV antigen-positive cells also were detected in the liver of Mavs/ mice on day 6 after infection. hepatocytes appear to be a major target of OROV infection. in contrast, in the spleen, OROV antigen-positive cells were observed only in sections of Ifnar/ mice. inset images show a higher magnification image (taken at 40 magnification) and correspond to the region marked by the arrow. we measured serum levels of 23 pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines on days 4 and 6 after OROV infection using Bio-Plex assays. cytokine and chemokine levels were elevated in KO mice after OROV infection. the relatively minor change in IL-1 and TNF- levels suggests that the disease pathogenesis occurs independently of a generalized cytokine storm.

OROV replicated to higher levels (2.3- to 4.2-fold, P 0.05) in Ifnar/, Mavs/, and Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO MEFs. supernatants were harvested at the indicated times for titration by focus-forming assay. the data represent the means SD from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. the data represent the means SD from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. EFs, as a positive control, with west Nile virus (WNV), an encephalitic flavivirus that potently induces type I IFN (52) OROV infection did not inhibit type I IFN or ISG induction in WT MEFs. production of these mRNA, however, was delayed and blunted in Mavs/ and Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO MEFs. MEFs from WT, Ifnar/, Mavs/, and Irf3/ Irf7/ mice were infected with OROV at an MOI of 0.1 or mock infected. at 1, 4, 12, or 36 h after infection, the relative expression levels of Gapdh (A), Ifna (B), Ifnb (C) and Ifit1 (D) mRNA were determined by qRT-PCR. the cells were lysed and harvested at the indicated times for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR. the data represent the means SD from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. in comparison, the production of IFNA, IFNB, and IFIT1 mRNAs after OROV infection was blunted in both 2fTGH and U3A. c Cre+ Ifnarf/f and CD11c Cre+ Ifnarf/f mice selectively delete IFNAR expression on M, monocytes, and granulocytes. mortality rates and weight loss were similar to those for OROV-infected Cre Ifnarf/f or WT mice. CD11c Cre+ Ifnarf/f (n = 30), LysM Cre+ Ifnarf/f (n = 25) and Cre Ifnarf/f (n = 31) mice were used to construct survival curves. weight loss curves were compared at a given time point using 2-way ANOVA. weight loss analysis of 8-week-old mice after inoculation with 105 FFU (G) or 106 FFU (H) of LACV by footpad injection in the same mice. asterisks indicate differences statistically significant compared to WT animals with the same viral dose (*, P 0.05). a significant weight loss in CD11c Cre+ Ifnarf/f mice occurred late, on days 10 and 12 and only after infection with 106 FFU of LACV. unexpectedly, LysM Cre+ Ifnarf/f mice were more resistant to lethal LACV infection than WT or Cre Ifnarf/f mice. a deficiency of IFNAR expression on radio-resistant nonmyeloid cells determines OROV pathogenesis. bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 WT or Ifnar/ mice were transferred adoptively (107 cells per recipient animal) recipients animals were infected with 106 FFU of OROV. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences (**, P 0.01; ***, P 0.001) in mice, OROV virulence is age dependent, with older animals more resistant to lethal infection (22). OROV-infected Ifnar/ mice exhibited lethargy and decreased body temperature, especially late in the course of disease. but signs of neuroinvasive disease, including limb paralysis, ataxia, seizures, or sustained tremors, were not apparent in OROV-infected Ifnar/ mice. the weight loss curves were compared using 2-way ANOVA. s indicate differences statistically significant compared to WT mice. surviving animals were unable to test OROV infection in vivo. surviving animals gained weight more slowly than uninfected mice. surviving animals showed no enhanced mortality or weight loss. on day 1 after infection, we did not detect infectious virus in any tissue. we detected virus as early as day 2 after infection in the liver and serum of Ifnar/ mice. by day 4 after infection, high levels of OROV were recovered from the liver and spleen of all Ifnar/ and Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO mice. data points represent individual mice. bars indicate median values and were obtained from 8 to 15 mice per time point. red cross indicates that all OROV-infected Ifnar/ animals were dead. increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (7,307 U/liter, 601 U/liter, and 7,164 U/liter, respectively, compared to 111 U/liter in infected WT mice. serum levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, and creatine kinase were similar between infected WT and KO mice. f3/ Irf7/ mice obtained 4 and 6 days after infection with 106 FFU of OROV. data points represent individual mice and are pooled from three independent experiments. the red dotted lines represent the mean values from three mock-infected naive mice. TUNEL staining showed a greater number of dead cells in the liver and spleen of Ifnar/ and Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO mice by day 4 after OROV infection. small foci of OROV antigen-positive cells also were detected in the liver of Mavs/ mice on day 6 after infection. hepatocytes appear to be a major target of OROV infection. hematoxylin and eosin staining analysis of liver (A) and spleen (B) from uninfected WT mice and OROV-infected WT, Ifnar/, or Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO mice. Representative images (20 magnification) were taken 4 days after OROV infection from 3 mice from each group. we did not observe elevated levels of inflammasome-generated (e.g., IL-1) or vasoactive (e.g., TNF-) cytokines in the infected KO mice. the increased levels of these proinflammatory cytokines suggested a mechanism of production that was independent of MAVS, which contrasts with prior studies with flaviviruses (51). a red cross indicates that all OROV-infected Ifnar/ animals were dead at the indicated time point. the red dotted lines represent the mean values from three mock-infected mice for each analyzed cytokine.

OROV induces type I IFN production in mouse cells. we infected WT, Ifnar/, Mavs/, and Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO MEFs with OROV and measured Ifna and Ifnb mRNA levels by qRT-PCR. we did not detect IFN- protein by ELISA in the supernatants of Mavs/ or Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO MEFs. high levels were observed in OROV-infected WT and Ifnar/ cells. Ifit1 mRNA levels were abolished in OROV-infected Ifnar/ cells. gene expression was normalized to 18S rRNA and is displayed as the fold increase compared to the mock-infected cells on a log2 scale. data represent the means SD from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. the production of IFNA, IFNB, and IFIT1 mRNAs after OROV infection was blunted in both 2fTGH and U3A (a 2fTGH-derived cell lacking STAT1) human fibrosarcoma cells relative to GAPDH expression or WNV infection. low levels of the ISG IFIT1 were observed in OROV-infected cells. this suggests a virus-mediated defect in IFN-dependent or independent induction pathways. narf/f, CD11c Cre+ Ifnarf/f, or Cre Ifnarf/f mice on day 4 after infection by focus-forming assay. higher levels of OROV RNA were measured in the spleen of LysM Cre+ Ifnarf/f (P 0.004) and CD11c Cre+ Ifnarf/f (P 0.05) mice. this suggests that type I IFN signaling in nonmyeloid cells contributes to restricting OROV RNA was detected in the liver, spleen, and liver of WT mice by qRT-PCR. bars indicate median values and were obtained from 10 mice per group. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences. data are pooled from at least three independent experiments. survival curves were analyzed by log rank test. weight loss values were compared by 2-way ANOVA. reciprocal bone marrow chimera and infection studies were performed. we adoptively transferred WT or Ifnar/ bone marrow cells into sublethally irradiated 4-week-old Ifnar/ or WT recipient mice. 8 weeks later, the reconstitution of donor immune cells in blood was confirmed in recipient mice. recipient animals were infected with 106 FFU of OROV. four days later, serum, spleen, and liver were harvested for blood chemistry. results were compared to data obtained in parallel experiments with OROV-infected unmanipulated Ifnar/ mice. a high proportion of Ifnar/, Mavs/, and Irf3/ Irf7/ DKO mice succumbed to lethal infection by a subcutaneous injection route. the results demonstrate that an IFN-induced antiviral state against OROV was triggered downstream of MAVS activation and IRF-3- and IRF-7-mediated transcription. IRF-3 and IRF-7 are transcription factors that regulate expression of type I IFN and ISGs. the nonredundant roles of IRF-3 and IRF-7 have been documented in pathogenesis studies with other viruses. OV disease in the KO mice does not clearly parallel human infection. the development of subcutaneous infection mouse models of OROV likely will be useful in monitoring effects on viral replication in the context of future preclinical testing of therapeutics. CD11c Cre+ Ifnarf/f and LysM Cre+ Ifnarf/f did not succumb to infection with 106 FFU of OROV or 105 FFU of LACV. chimera studies revealed that IFNAR signaling in radio-resistant cells helps to restrict OROV infection and injury in the liver. a recent study showed myeloid dendritic cells are critical for the type I IFN response and protection to LACV in adult mice. differences on routes of infection (subcutaneous versus intraperitoneal) and age of animals (8 versus 6 weeks old) may explain the disparity in mortality rates between the two studies in CD11c Cre+ Ifnarf/f mice after LACV infection. the recent development of an artificial minigenome system for OROV (78) will help address which genes (L, NSs, or other genes) antagonize the type I IFN pathway to promote infection. a species-specific immune antagonism activity of OROV NSs (or L) blocks human but not mouse IFN responses. the animal models described here may be useful for understanding the basic biology of OROV, an emerging infectious disease with epidemic potential."}
