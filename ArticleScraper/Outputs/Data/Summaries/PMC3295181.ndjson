{"summary": "TEXT Adult disease with human rhinovirus (HRV) typically follows a mild course, but is the most frequent viral infection associated with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4, 16, 21, 22) HRV causes symptoms typical of other upper respiratory viruses (20, 25), and patients can present with an influenza-like illness (ILI) or an afebrile upper respiratory illness. all analyses were performed using the mantel-Haenszel chi-square test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. 630 specimens submitted for respiratory viral testing; 127 patients (20.2%) tested positive for influenza A virus, 80 (12.6%) for HRV, and 11 (1.7%) for other viruses (7 parainfluenza, 1 respiratory syncytial virus B, 1 adenovirus, 2 human metapneumovirus) NS Unknown 21 (21.2) 12 (19.4) NS Immunocompromised (no. [%] 10 (10.1) 17 (27.4) 0.01 Pregnancy (no. [%] 5 (5.1) 3 (4.8) NS Obesity (no. [%]) 6 (6.1) 4 (6.5) NS Comorbidities (no. [%]) 61 (61.6) 44 (71.0) NS Pulmonary 17 (17.2) 9 (14.5) significantly more patients in the pH1N1 group were started on antiviral therapy than in the HRV group (Table 1). there were no statistically significant differences in hospital admission rate, intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, length of stay, and length of stay. the deaths of 3 of 4 individuals potentially could be attributed to causes other than pH1N1 or HRV infection. NS, no statistical significance. NS, no statistical significance. mortality was lower in non-pH1N1-infected patients, but they had fewer immunocompromised patients in these groups. the advent of molecular platforms that are approved to detect HRV will enhance the understanding of the epidemiology and severity of disease related to HRV."}
