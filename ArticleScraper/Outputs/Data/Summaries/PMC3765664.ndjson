{"summary": "the emergence of a novel human coronavirus causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like disease. the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics remains a clinical priority. it is necessary to evaluate neutralizing antibodies and screen for MERS-CoV entry inhibitors. the world health organization (WHO) had received reports of 94 cases of infection caused by this novel human coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including 47 deaths. eight MERS-CoV clusters have been reported, suggesting person-to-person transmission of the disease. genetically, MERS-CoV is closely related to SARS-CoV [1,6] in this study, we produced a pseudovirus bearing the full-length S protein of MERS-CoV in the Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 backbone. we then established a pseudovirus-based inhibition assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies and anti-MERS-CoV entry inhibitors. this method was proven safe, convenient, reliable and effective for the rapid detection of neutralizing antibodies and viral entry inhibitors against MERS-CoV. animal cell types were infected by MERS-CoV pseudovirus to a significantly higher degree than other cell types, such as PK15, Caco-2 and HeLa. however, no high infectivity was observed in MA-104. Western blot was carried out to identify the incorporation of MERS-CoV S in the packaged MERS-CoV pseudovirus. the data are expressed as mean relative luciferase units (RLU) standard deviation (SD) of 4 parallel wells. anti-p24 (1:50) and MERS-CoV S-specific polyclonal antibodies (1:200) were used for the test. anti-actin monoclonal antibodies (1:5,000, Sigma) were applied as the internal control. mice were vaccinated with a recombinant protein expressing RBD of MERS-CoV S protein. representative sera (Sera 1\u20133) collected from 10 days post-2nd vaccine were used for the test. the results were similar to those for the same compounds tested in NBL-7 cells. they may interact with the positively charge residues in the spike protein of the pseudotyped MERS-CoV. however, none of the compounds inhibited pseudotypes containing VSV-G when tested in NBL-7 cell lines. ADS-J1 exhibited some cytotoxicity to Huh-7 cells with CC50 (the concentration causing 50% cytotoxicity) of 26.9 M. however, its selective index (CC50/IC50) is about 45. the established pseudovirus inhibition assay could be used to rapidly screen MERS-CoV entry inhibitors. MERS-CoV pseudovirus infected HT-1080 and ACE2-293T cells. human cell types, such as Hep-2, HEP-G2, A549 and MT-2, and animal cell types, including FRhK-4, MDCK, Vero, Vero E6 and NBL-7, were infected by MERS-CoV pseudovirus. VSV-G and Env- pseudoviruses were used as positive and negative controls. the data are expressed as mean relative luciferase units (RLU) standard deviation (SD) of 4 parallel wells in 96-well culture plates. anti-p24 (1:50) and MERS-CoV S-specific polyclonal antibodies (1:200) were used for the test. MERS-CoV pseudovirus inhibition assay reliably detected the neutralizing activity of vaccinated animal sera. the established pseudovirus inhibition assay is sufficiently reliable to evaluate neutralizing antibodies induced by candidate vaccines against MERS-CoV. mice were vaccinated with a recombinant protein expressing RBD of MERS-CoV S protein. representative sera (Sera 1\u20133) collected from 10 days post-2nd vaccine were used for the test. HIV entry inhibitors, C34 and T20 [15], showed moderate inhibitory activity on MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection at 2.5 and 20 M. the results were similar to those for the same compounds tested in NBL-7 cells, with around 90% of MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry inhibition at concentrations of 20 M. the data are presented as mean percentages of inhibition (or cytotoxicity) SD of duplicate wells. the experiment was repeated three times, and similar results were obtained. lentiviral pseudotype had relatively lower infectivity in HT-1080, Hep-2, MT-2 and NBL-7 cells with undetectable DPP4 expression. this suggests that the infectivity of MERS-CoV pseudovirus might not be completely associated with the expression level of DPP4. MERS-CoV S protein S2 subunit induced by binding of S1 subunit to the not-yet-identified alternative receptor on NBL-7 cells. however, these peptides may not be able to interact with the HR1 conformation of MERS-CoV S protein S2 subunit induced by the binding of S1 subunit to the well-defined receptor DPP4 on Huh-7 cells. however, to carry out this type of inhibition assay, it is necessary to the established MERS-CoV inhibition assay is a safe and convenient pseudovirus-based alternative to BSL-3 live-virus restrictions. it can be used to rapidly screen MERS-CoV entry inhibitors and evaluate vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with 20 g of plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and 20 g of rMERS-CoV-S plasmid. supernatants were harvested 72 h post-transfection and used for single-cycle infection. Western blot Western blot was performed to detect HIV-1 p24 and MERS-CoV S protein in the generated pseudovirus. the blots were then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (for HIV-1 p24 and MERS-CoV S, 1:3,000, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. expression and purification of recombinant protein fused with Fc (S-RBD-Fc) were done as previously described. genes encoding RBD (residues 377\u2013662) of MERS-CoV S protein were amplified by PCR using synthesized codon-optimized full-length S sequences of MERS-CoV as the template. the sequence-confirmed recombinant plasmid was transfected into vaccinated mouse sera and inhibitory ability of antiviral agents against infection of MERS-CoV pseudovirus in target cells. dilutions of mouse sera were incubated with 100 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of virus for 1 h at 37\u00b0C for 1 h before addition to the monolayer of Vero E6 cells in triplicate. 105 l of XTT solution (1 mg/ml) containing 0.02 M of phenazinemethosulphate were added. four hour later, the absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured with ELISA plate Reader. all animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) guidelines. 293T cells were co-transfected with 20 g of plasmid encoding HIV-1 (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and 20 g of rMERS-CoV-S plasmid. cells were changed into fresh DMEM 8 h later. supernatants were harvested 72 h post-transfection and used for single-cycle infection. Western blot Western blot was performed to detect HIV-1 p24 and MERS-CoV S protein in the generated pseudovirus. lysed pseudovirus (200 ng/ml p24) or cell lysates (30 g total proteins) were separated by 10% Tris-glycine gels, which were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (for HIV-1 expression and purification of recombinant protein fused with Fc (S-RBD-Fc) were done as previously described. genes encoding RBD (residues 377\u2013662) of MERS-CoV S protein were amplified by PCR using synthesized codon-optimized full-length S sequences of MERS-CoV as the template. the sequence-confirmed recombinant plasmid was transfected into virus inhibition assay was established to detect neutralizing activity of vaccinated mouse sera and inhibitory ability of antiviral agents against infection of MERS-CoV pseudovirus in target cells. mutants were incubated with serially diluted mouse sera or synthetic compounds at 37\u00b0C for 1 h before adding to target cells preplated in 96-well culture plates (104 cells/well) twenty-four hours later, cells were refed with fresh medium. 40 medium were added to equal volumes of cells (5 105/ml) in 96-well tissue culture plates. 50 l of XTT solution (1 mg/ml) containing 0.02 M of phenazinemethosulphate were added. four hour later, the absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured with ELISA plate Reader."}
