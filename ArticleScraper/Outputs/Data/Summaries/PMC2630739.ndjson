{"summary": "the first group comprised symptomatic children whose respiratory specimens were submitted to the Clinical Virology Laboratory, Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut. the second group comprised asymptomatic children at the hospital-affiliated pediatric clinic for well-child care. nucleic acids were extracted from each specimen by using QIAamp nucleic acid purification kits. HCoV OC43, RNA extraction and reverse transcription were performed as previously described (7). we tested 423 direct fluorescent antibody\u2013negative respiratory specimens, from 367 children, for KIV and WUV. none of the 96 specimens from asymptomatic children tested positive for WUV. patient group No. KIV-positive children/total no. tested (%) No. WUV-positive children/total no. tested (%) Respiratory tract disease 8/367 (2.2) 26/367 (7.1) *KIV, KI virus; WUV, WU virus. p = 0.215, compared with asymptomatic children. p = 1.0, compared with asymptomatic children. 13 (50%) of the 26 WUV-positive symptomatic children tested positive for hMPV. 7 (26%) were positive for hMPV, 4 (15%) for HRV, 2 (7%) for HCoV-NL63, and 2 (7%) for HBoV. we detected WUV in asymptomatic and symptomatic children (3\u20135,13) this finding provides further evidence that asymptomatic infection of WUV may occur. it is possible that subclinical infection with KIV occurs and that we failed to detect any cases."}
