{"summary": "aptamers are single strand nucleic acid molecules, consisting of DNA or RNA that bind to organic or nonorganic molecules. the method referred to as SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) was invented in 1990 independently by two teams. aptamers are isolated, cloned and sequenced with following validation. unique properties of aptamers make them competitive to monoclonal antibodies. unique properties of aptamers make them competitive to monoclonal antibodies. the first pharmaceutical aptamer, pegaptanib sodium, has been admitted in 2004 by the US agency for fda in therapy of age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) aptamers are currently being evaluated in phases II and III of clinical trials, for example in hemophilia (ARC19499) [15], von Willebrand\u2019s disease (ARC1779) [16,17] and lung cancer (AS1411) [15,18]. studies on other viruses have not been carried out systematically, e.g., only occasional experiments were conducted with aptamers against Rift Valley Fever, Dengue or different arboviruses. avian influenza was an epidemiological challenge; the disease is characterized by a severe course, high mortality rate and increased risk of zoonotic influenza strain generation. aptamers can detect influenza virus type A: H1N1 and H3N2, as well as avian virus, H5N1 [36,37], thus, it was shown that aptamers can recognize dangerous influenza strains with high epidemiological risk. it is still necessary to generate simple and available technics to increase the benefits of aptamers. labib et al. constructed gold microelectrodes with impedimetric properties. they applied heat-inactivated Vaccinia as a model. the idea was based on the presence of unspecified membrane marker on the cell surface. the cells that initiated malignant transformation did not bind the aptamer. they received sequences with high specificity and affinity for viral proteins and whole inactive viruses. they also proposed the aptamers to be used for passive immunity and antiviral prophylaxis. the enzyme cleaved the DNA sequence stained with fluorescent dyer with subsequent appearance of fluorescence. the enzyme cleaved the DNA sequence stained with fluorescent dyer with subsequent appearance of fluorescence, with intensity proportional to the number of viral copies. gene epitopes on cell surface proteins of non-infected

spectrum of data lateral flow chromatographic test strip fluorescent aptamer-magne fluorescent dye-conjugated aptamers seem to be useful in a variety of diagnostic tests. a specific host immunity develops after several weeks or months from the origin of infection. molecular assays allow for direct detection of alien genetic material without waiting for the immune response of the host. they present an attractive alternative to the currently used procedures, due to their high specificity, affinity of binding to any viral antigen and low cost production. aptamers allow for detection of both: early (genetic material, viral proteins) and late (host own antibodies) infection markers. aptamer-based biosensors could have been applied as promising approach in some specific issues. they could be used for cheap diagnosis at an early stage of the disease, i.e., immediately after exposure to the pathogen, as well as to monitor the treatment process. aptamers are RNA molecules that are highly susceptible to degradation by nucleases. this problem can be solved by synthesizing a \u201cmirror\u201d analog of these particles that retain their original properties, but are not cleaved by nucleases. aptamers are able to distinguish then influenza type A from type B or closely related strains of the same influenza subtype. aptamers can recognize dangerous influenza strains with high epidemiological risk. it is still necessary to generate simple and available technics. an important influence for viral diagnostics development with aptamers have been made by Labib et al. who constructed gold microelectrodes with impedimetric properties to distinguish biologically active from inactive form of the virus. the idea was based on the presence of unspecified membrane marker appearing on the cell surface. toscano-Garibay et al. used in vitro selection to obtain the RNA aptamer that binds viral E7 oncoprotein. the cells that initiated malignant transformation did not bind the aptamer. restriction enzyme complex, (iv) DNA motive bound to fluorescence inhibitor, (v) EcoRI target sequence, and (vi) DNA fragment labeled with a fluorescent dyer. the enzyme cleaved the DNA sequence stained with fluorescent dyer with subsequent appearance of fluorescence. aptamers have been attached to its surface since they were modified by biotinylation. the material tested in the study was saliva harvested from the poultry. the method does not require any labeling procedures. the fluorescent dye (Cyanine3) RNA aptamer bound viral glycoprotein E2 [26]. these approaches might be crucial for the early diagnosis of hepatitis C at the moment of \u201cwindow period\u201d, when serum antibodies have not been appeared yet. most of the currently used immunosorbent tests are able to detect a current disease just at the moment of specific antibody formation directed against the infective agent. however, a specific host immunity develops after several weeks or months from the origin of infection. the problem is known as the so-called \u201cwindow period\u201d. the detection time of influenza virus using aptasensor-based technique is remarkable shorter than in other methods [19,47,48,49,50]. aptasensor-based technique ensure increased sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test [19,47,48,49,50]. aptamer-based biosensors could have been applied as promising approach in some specific issues. they could be used for cheap diagnosis at an early stage of the disease, i.e., immediately after exposure to the pathogen, as well as to monitor the treatment process. many methods used in the treatment of viral infections have been only partially effective. standard treatment in HCV (with ribavirin and interferon-alpha) is effective in 50% of cases. about 0.5 million of patients die every year [72]. these problems should be the basis for searching new therapeutic tools. in vitro therapeutic experiments and models in vivo. Influenza H5N1 A22 DNA HA BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with the A22 solution. inhibition of viral infection in an aptamer-dose dependent manner. in vitro reaction rate decreased (100% by 50 nM of aptamer) Kd = 0.66 nM IC50 = 2.5 nM [84] DP6-12 Gag protein 293T cells transfected with plasmid encoding aptamer. 20-fold inhibition of virus production Kd = 130 9 nM [85] Ch A-1 (anti-gp120 aptamer-siRNA chimera) gp120 (aptamer aptamer added to HCV-NS5B in vitro reaction. inhibition of NS5B polymerase activity Kd = 1.5 0.2 nM IC50 = 10 0.5 nM; [89] NEO-35-s41 G925-s50 NS3 aptamer added to NS5B in vitro reaction. helicase unwinding activity inhibited in 85% IC50 = 1.2 nM [95] Ebola 1G8-14 2F11-14 RNA eVP35 IID n/d --- inhibition of EBOV polymerase activity. many viruses show a tropism for specific cell types. Chen et al. constructed DNA aptamer, assigned as ZE2, competitively blocking E2 in majority of HCV serotypes. it is a co-receptor of human CD81, presented on hepatocytes and B lymphocytes. its usefulness was proved in Huh7.5.1, human established cell line of hepatocellular carcinoma. aptamer 10 strongly bound HA1 subunit of dangerous strain H5N1 avian influenza virus. application of aptamer slowed down progress of infection. authors emphasized that application might persuade host immune system to gain time for the generation of effective antiviral response. amer had no cytotoxic effects and its IC50 was calculated to be 0.8 M. a significant aptamer\u2019s specificity allowed to distinguish HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains. inhibition of enzymes or other proteins involved in viral replication. the aptamer molecules were found intracellularly, as it was proven by confocal microscopy. despite the absence of the transfection agent, the aptamer molecules were found intracellularly. the crucial moment for HBV replication and assembly is an interaction of the viral protein R (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) with stem-loop structure of sequence located from the 5' side of the pregenomic RNA. both domains are essential for the replication of Flaviviridae family. helicase domain converts viral proteins necessary for its life cycle. helicase unwinds DNA and RNA duplexes. NS5A-5 aptamers allowed for its inactivation in infected Huh7.5 cells. viral RNA level was one-fold decrease in comparison to non-treated controls. naive cells infected with supernatants harvested from cell cultures treated with aptamers. a dose-dependent manner, up to 85% of baseline value (with IC50 = 1.2 nM), was confirmed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) test. the progress of some viral infections can be prevented by inhibition of nucleocapsid synthesis. IRES is composed of four domains, I-IV, located in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) it is responsible for the initiation of viral replication and mRNA cap-independent translation. AP30 inhibited HCV genetic material replication during in vitro analysis by about 50%. cultures transfected with 0.5 pmol 3-07 aptamer showed decrease in luciferase activity up to 45%. attention was focused on simultaneous inhibition of IRES domains II and III-IV; especially, IIId and IIIe regions seem crucial in HCV translation. the use of the construct aptamer-siRNA would limit the specific therapy to the fraction of the target cells, selectively recognized by aptamer. the use of the construct aptamer-siRNA would limit the specific therapy to the fraction of the target cells. mer alone showed the inhibitory effect on virus infectivity. the chimera (Ch A-1) biostability in mouse serum was improved by 2'-F modification of the aptamer. aptamer-siRNA conjugates up-take was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. inhibition effect was characterized by decrease in mRNA protease expression in CD4+ T cells transfected with pcDNA-HIV-PR plasmid as proved in qRT-PCR assay. dey et al. used RNA aptamer B40 and its shorter variant, B40t77. they blocked gp120 binding by its T cell co-receptor, CCR5. they observed decrease in concentration of p24 HIV-1 antigen in supernatants. in vitro cultures in established Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cell line. best effect was observed between 50 and 100 pmol of A22. infiltration of mononuclear cells in lungs alveoli was reduced. the 50% inhibition of viral plaque formation in culture was observed after administration of 125 20 nM and 35 10 nM of L13 and L19 aptamer. the binding site of the aptamer have been different from that recognized by specific monoclonal antibody. amer B.2 characterized by stem-loop structure, with a specific sequence UAUGGACCAGUGGC recognizing a key element\u2014a GTP binding site of NS5B. it blocked NS5B activity by another way, i.e., by competition the polymerase-binding site with the viral RNA template. deStefano and Nair confirmed in vitro effectiveness of DNA aptamer. aptamer competed with natural template for binding site to the enzyme. reaction rate was decreased in 50% and 100% in presence of 2.5 nM and 50 nM of 37NT aptamer. aptamer inhibited the activity of both NS3 protease and helicase domains. this effect was significant and aptamer dose-dependent. they hypothesized that the aptamer competed with the 3'-UTR regions. nsP10 (Nonstructural protein 10) enzyme with NTPase/helicase activity inhibited viral enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. nsP10 inhibited viral enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner, up to 85% of baseline value. the proper function of the aptamer was based on competition with the packaging signal of HIV-1 for nucleocapsid binding site. in the previous study, Kim et al. selected 10-3 anti-HIV-1 RNA aptamer. it bound two different sequence regions, rich in GC and GU. qRT-PCR revealed 90%, 68%, and 19% reductions in virus RNA levels at aptamer concentrations of 5 M, 1 M, and 100 nM. the crucial moment for HBV replication is an interaction of the viral protein R (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) with stem-loop structure of sequence located from the 5' side of the pregenomic RNA. NS3 protein (Nonstructural protein3) consisted of two domains (C- and N-terminal one) with helicase and protease activity, respectively. both domains are essential for the replication of Flaviviridae family, including HCV. amer competed with the 3'-UTR regions of HCV genome for binding site of helicase domain. NS5A-4 and NS5A-5 aptamers allowed for its inactivation in infected Huh7.5 cells. viral RNA level was one-fold decrease in comparison to non-treated aptamer controls. aptamer inhibited viral enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner, up to 85% of baseline value (with IC50 = 1.2 nM), what was confirmed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) test [95]. Typical therapeutic target is Gag protein of HIV-1 nucleocapsid because of its low variability. IRES is composed of four domains, I-IV, located in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) it is responsible for the initiation of viral replication and mRNA cap-independent translation. AP30 inhibited HCV genetic material replication during in vitro analysis by about 50%. study developed aptamer 3-07, directed against the IIId domain of IRES. it successfully inhibited viral in vitro translation and seemed to be much more efficient than the aptamer targeting the second domain of IRES. the inhibition potential of the selected molecule was also proved in HeLa cells model. aptamer-siRNA would limit the specific therapy to the fraction of target cells, selectively recognized by aptamer. the use of the construct aptamer-siRNA would limit the specific therapy to the fraction of the target cells. tat/rev mRNA expression was decreased in the qRT-PCR reaction. anti-gp120 aptamer alone also showed the inhibitory effect on virus infectivity. the therapeutic effect has been therefore strengthened. aptamer-siRNA conjugates up-take was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. inhibition effect was characterized by decrease in mRNA protease expression in CD4+ T cells transfected with pcDNA-HIV-PR plasmid. aptamer-siRNA chimeras could prevent human cells from HIV-1 infection. the best and most current example is the Ebola virus, which is perceived as severe threat to global public health. many experiments have been conducted to discover a vaccine. up to date, only two reports contribute aptamers as potential tool in Ebola diagnosis and treatment. aptamer vs. siRNA Considering the therapeutic potential of aptamers, it must be considered that there are at least a few competitors, both low- (e.g., siRNA) and highmolecular weight molecules. andundoubted advantage over siRNA molecules is the interaction between aptamers and a wide spectrum of potential target molecules. the wide spectrum of target ligands makes them competitive to other solutions. aptamers associated with extracellular targets will be the first in clinical practice. aptamer activity is reduced by their hydrophilic features. unmodified aptamers may be characterized by half-life time less than 2 min. aptamers are resistant to 3'-exonucleases activity, which dominantly occurs in the extracellular environment. aptamers can be inverted on the 3' side of aptamer by obtaining two 5' ends. only one aptamer-based drug has entered clinical trials and gains marketing approval [14]. the number of reports on the possible side effects of such products is relatively small. aptamers may lead to the infrequent production of neutralizing antibodies. aptamer was able to penetrate into cells without the involvement of additional carriers. it has been shown that viral vectors introduced into cells may lead to the insertional mutagenesis and/or development of disease other than initially treated. a very interesting solution could be the application of aptamers as highly-specific therapeutic carriers. unmodified aptamers directed against targets existing in the blood may be characterized by half-life time less than 2 min. aptamers are resistant to 3'-exonucleases activity, which dominantly occurs in the extracellular environment. aptamers may be directed against surface markers of these pathogens. there have been no similar studies about antiviral activities of aptamers. however, the results obtained in other experiments show that this method would be effective [121] in case of antiviral aptamers. the clinical trials are needed to focus on the actual efficacy of antiviral aptamers. Aptamers are single strand nucleic acid molecules, consistd of DNA or RNA. properties of aptamers make them competitive to monoclonal antibodies. properties of aptamers make them competitive to monoclonal antibodies used in conventional laboratory practice. the first pharmaceutical aptamer, Macugen (pegaptanib sodium) has been admitted by US agency for the treatment of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) in 2004."}
