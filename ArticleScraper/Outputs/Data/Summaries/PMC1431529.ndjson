{"summary": "the majority of syndromic surveillance systems have been based primarily in emergency department settings. the majority of syndromic surveillance systems have been based primarily in emergency department settings. however, very few projects have looked at using a telephone helpline as a source of data. a new era of surveillance research is attempting to address these issues while taking advantage of available data. syndromic surveillance is a newly emerging field in the science of epidemiological surveillance. it can provide prediagnostic data to rapidly detect infectious disease outbreaks before they are detected. the science of syndromic surveillance is still very much in its infancy. syndromic surveillance can and has been able to assist in determining the size, spread and tempo of an outbreak after it has been detected. syndromic surveillance can and has been useful in times of calm, \"providing reassurance that a large-scale outbreak is not occurring\" the NHS Direct national telephone helpline was established in the UK in 1998. the country has 21 regional calling sites in England and Wales. each of these 200+ algorithms has a set of questions attached to them. the results have been optimistic about the long-term use of NHS Direct as an \"early warning system\" an average of 3,100 calls are recorded daily[33], with the highest call volumes occurring during the evenings and holidays. the most commonly requested languages other than English and French are Mandarin, Cantonese, Farsi, Italian and Portuguese. the effectiveness of Telehealth as a real-time surveillance system will be investigated. this project will have both a retrospective and a prospective component. this project will link all \"reasons for call\" and assigned algorithms to a syndrome. cold symptoms, bronchitis, cough, shortness of breath, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia are counted in this category, not Constitutional. the presence of both cold and flu symptoms is counted in this category, not Constitutional. the presence of both cold and flu symptoms is counted in this category, not Constitutional. the prospective monitoring of syndromic activity will be done temporally and spatially. the decision to pursue both types of analyses is due to Ontario's large geographic size. spatial clustering analysis has been adapted for infectious disease surveillance. syndromic surveillance activity monitored by the Telehealth Project is only planned for Telehealth calls made in the Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington catchment area. the last step of the evaluation of Telehealth as an early warning system will be an economic analysis that will attempt to ascertain whether Telehealth provides medical and non-medical cost savings. if Telehealth had been up and operational as an early warning system, we can speculate that the number of calls for gastrointestinal complaints would have gone up. this would have created an alert for public health to investigate these calls before an increase in cases would have been identified through routine reporting systems. this would have reduced the number of cases and would have allowed public health to work more effectively and within its available resources. each and every Ontarian can access advice based on the type and severity of symptoms they are reporting. advice can range from staying at home to going to an emergency department immediately. this means that data for areas with limited access to emergency departments and family physicians will be collected, thereby providing new information on an underserviced subset of the population.
