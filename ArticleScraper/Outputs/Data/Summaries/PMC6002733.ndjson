{"summary": "CPV and feline panleukopenia virus have single-stranded DNA genomes of about 5,100 bases that encode at least 4 genes. the genomes are packaged into small, nonenveloped, and stable capsids consisting of 60 subunits. CPV and FPV show natural variations in host range that are controlled by differences in viral capsids and their interactions with the host receptor. canine parvovirus type-2 (CPV-2) arose in the mid-1970s as a variant of a virus similar to but distinct from FPV. in 1978, CPV spread worldwide, causing a pandemic of disease among dogs, wolves, and coyotes. CPV acquired the canine host range as the result of mutations to a small number of residues on or near the capsid surface. the CPV-like viruses in dogs have continued to evolve since the emergence of the CPV-2a common ancestor. a variety of mutations have become widespread in the virus population. a variety of mutations have become widespread in the virus population. some capsid variants bound efficiently to the TfR and were endocytosed into cells but did not result in infection. however, the number of bound receptors that mediate binding during cell infection appears to be very low for CPV and FPV infection. most of the Fabs tested appeared to fully or nearly fully occupy the 60 possible binding sites on the capsids when added in excess (46, 47). some Fabs were poorly neutralizing even when present in excess of the binding sites and others neutralizing the virus with as few as 5 to 10 Fabs per capsid (48). changes in the capsid after binding, either at high occupancy or when groups of receptors bind to one region of the capsid. antibody binding has been shown to induce changes in the structures of some viral proteins (9, 10, 12, 59) this key area in the natural history of animal viruses by examining the specific interactions of the parvovirus capsids and their receptors involved in infection. fRs are largely conserved, but loops with low sequence conservation exist in the apical domain. antibodies against two different sites on the capsids were also examined. soluble TfR, an scFv-Fc, and engineered VLPs are diagrammed in Fig. 1. Fabs are shown binding to capsids that are attached to a biosensor via an scFv-Fc. Fabs are shown binding to a capsid that is attached to a protein A biosensor via an scFv-Fc. CPV-2 FPV R80N, N93K, I101T, A103V, I232V, F303Y, N323D, N375D, S564N, G568A A300D CPV-2 A300D CPV-2a M87L, I101T, A300G, D305Y, N426D CPV-2 VLPs N93K Loop 1 mutant VLPs N85A, M87A, V92A, N the feline and raccoon TfRs bound to all capsids, as expected from previous studies. CPV-2 capsids bound to the highest levels, while FPV and CPV-2 with a point mutant of CPV-2 bound to lower levels. the more recent strain of CPV (CPV-2a) bound to the lowest level. the black-backed jackal TfR is the closest relative to dogs that lack the canine TfR's Ni-NTA biosensors were washed (step 1), incubated with TfR ectodomains to 0.8 nm of measured binding (step 2), washed again (step 3), incubated with capsids at 240 g/ml to measure TfR/capsid association. results are measured as the change in wavelength (in nm) over time. binding approximated the results observed via bio-layer interferometry. previously published studies examining CPV binding to TRVb cells showed similar results. the antibodies Mab14 and MabE bind to the A and B sites of the capsid surface (46) the antibodies were purified from hybridomas and cleaved to form Fabs or expressed as scFv-Fcs. Fab 14 and 2.16 108 M for Fab E fit well in this assay. the FabE fit was poorer, likely due to a conformational change it has previously been shown to induce in capsids after binding. feline or black-backed jackal TfRs were attached to Ni-NTA biosensors via soluble TfR (steps 1 to 5), followed by incubation of TfR/CPV complexes with purified TfRs with cleaved His tags. we also examined the binding of the different TfRs to CPV-2 capsids. capsids were attached to biosensors with scFv-Fc14, scFv-FcE, black-backed jackal TfR, or feline TfR. they were then incubated with a very high concentration (4,800 nM) of Fab14 or FabE. Fab14 showed the lowest competitive effect and level of binding to the FPV capsid. capsids were attached to probes via scFv-Fc14, scFv-FcE, felTfR, or bbjTfR. Fab14 or FabE incubated with bbjTfR/CPV-2 complexes. capsids were then incubated with Fabs at high concentration (4,800 nM) saturating capsids with Fabs and/or TfRs also provided information about the level of occupancy of the different TfRs on capsids. steric blocking by the tethering scFv-Fc and the proximity to the biosensor tip may reduce the number of available binding sites. black-backed jackal TfR/CPV-2 complexes bound the highest levels of black-backed jackal or feline TfR. feline TfR/CPV-2 complexes bound the highest levels of black-backed jackal or feline TfR. feline TfR and scFv-Fc14/CPV-2 complexes showed slightly lower binding levels. felTfR, or scFv-Fc14 was used to attach CPV-2 capsids to probes. the total amount of CPV attached to the probe was equal to 1 nm after washing. capsids were then incubated with 1,600 nM bbjTfR/CPV-2, felTfR/CPV-2, or scFv-Fc14/CPV-2 complexes. loop 3 mutant VLPs were incubated with feline TfR, canine TfR, black-backed jackal TfR, scFv-Fc14, scFv-FcE, Fab14, and FabE. mutant VLPs were incubated with feline TfR, canine TfR, black-backed jackal TfR, scFv-Fc14, scFv-FcE scFv-Fc14 and Fab14 bound to all mutant capsids except for those with substitutions within its footprint. loop 3 mutant VLPs bound to scFv-FcE as well as wild-type VLPs. FabE competed all the different VLPs off scFv-FcE. a proportion of capsids appeared loosely bound and were quickly released from the TfRs when washed in buffer. the remaining capsids stayed attached to receptors for long periods. the black-backed jackal TfR showed the highest level of binding of any of the TfRs tested, regardless of the capsid form examined. parvovirus capsids are binding to feline, canine, raccoon, black-backed jackal, and human TfRs. results of capsids binding to feline, canine, raccoon, black-backed jackal, and human TfRs are shown. CPV-2 capsids were incubated with fixed TRVb cells expressing different TfRs. binding approximated the results observed via bio-layer interferometry. CPV and FPV on cells transfected to express different TfRs. antibodies Mab14 and MabE were purified from hybridomas and cleaved to form Fabs or expressed as scFv-Fcs in insect cells. capsids showed high on-rates and very low off-rates after binding to the scFv-Fc. Graphs were globally fit assuming a 1:1 Fab/binding site ratio. Fab14 fit the 1:1 model well in this assay. FabE fit was poorer, likely due to a conformational change it has previously been shown to induce in capsids after binding. FabE binding to CPV/scFv-FcE complexes, with FabE concentrations ranging from 37.5 nM to 300 nM. CPV-2 capsids are attached to Ni-NTA probes via soluble TfR. incubation of TfR/CPV complexes with purified TfRs with cleaved His tags. capsids were attached to biosensors with scFv-Fc14, scFv-FcE, black-backed jackal TfR, or feline TfR. they were then incubated with a very high concentration (4,800 nM) of Fab14 or FabE. Fab14 showed the lowest competitive effect and level of binding to the FPV capsid. capsids were attached to Ni-NTA probes or protein A probes. attached capsids were then incubated with Fabs at high concentration (4,800 nM) data strongly support the model where binding of the highly neutralizing FabE induces changes in the capsid that result in capsid detachment from different ligands. Fab14 or FabE incubated with felTfR/FPV complexes. errors show standard error. statistics were calculated for 300-s and 600-s time points. Fab14 or black-backed jackal TfR binding to CPV-2 to the amount of CPV-2 bound to biosensors allowed us to estimate that approximately 12 black-backed jackal TfRs bound to CPV-2. assuming that 1,600 nM feline TfR saturated felTfR/CPV-2 complexes in Fig. 4F, we estimated approximately 1 to 2 feline TfRs bound to CPV-2. al TfR during the disassociation phase also occurred with the feline TfR and scFv-Fc14/CPV-2 complexes. bbjTfR, felTfR, or scFv-Fc14 was used to attach CPV-2 capsids to probes. total amount of CPV attached to probe was equal to 1 nm after washing. mutant VLPs were incubated with feline TfR, canine TfR, black-backed jackal TfR, scFv-Fc14, scFv-FcE, Fab14, and FabE to determine how capsid surface loops affect ligand binding interactions. we mutated groups of surface-exposed residues in the VP2 structure, four residues in loop 1 (VP2 residues N85A, M87A scFv-Fc14 and Fab14 bound to all mutant capsids except for those with substitutions within its footprint. loop 3 mutant VLPs bound to scFv-FcE as well as wild-type VLPs. FabE competed all the different VLPs off scFv-FcE. these specific capsid-TfR contacts and interactions are key to the process of cell infection. they control the virus's natural host range and overlap the antibody binding sites on capsids. they confirm that there is no direct connection between the affinity of capsid binding to the TfR and the success of cell infection. FabE are incubated with scFv-Fc/capsid complexes, FabE competes with scFv-Fcs for capsid binding and FabE/capsid complexes are released from biosensors. more details about the binding site on the capsid and the ways in which viral residues control both the specific interactions with the TfR and the infectious process. CPV capsids engage fewer than five feline TfRs when they attach to the cell surface. incubating capsids with soluble feline TfR ectodomains prepared from insect cells showed binding of fewer than 5 feline TfRs on average. receptor occupancy was controlled at least in part by the receptor form tested. Fabs derived from whole IgGs and cloned versions expressed as scFv-Fcs. both Fabs were able to compete the capsids off the feline and black-backed jackal TfRs for capsid binding. both Fabs were able to compete the capsids off the feline and black-backed jackal TfRs. studies reveal new molecular details about interactions between closely related parvovirus capsids and the receptors from susceptible hosts. they confirm that there is no direct connection between the affinity of capsid binding to the TfR and the success of cell infection. this was most clearly seen in a comparison of the feline and canine TfRs, which mediate CPV-2a infection to similar levels. capsids of CPV-2 bound to TfR with higher affinity than CPV-2a capsids. CPV-2a arose naturally during 1979 and completely replaced CPV-2 within dogs worldwide by the end of 1980. CPV-2a capsids with 6 mutations in VP2 loop 3 bound the feline and other TfRs to similar or greater levels than wild-type VLPs. the binding of fewer than 5 feline TfRs per capsid was confirmed using bio-layer interferometry. however, we also showed that receptor occupancy was controlled at least in part by the receptor form tested. we also showed that receptor occupancy was controlled at least in part by the receptor form tested. FabE effectively competed with scFv-Fcs for capsid binding. both Fabs were able to compete the capsids off the feline and black-backed jackal TfRs. this suggests that receptor detachment is a mechanism of virus neutralization. a single-cell clone of the Crandell Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cell line (66) was received directly from Norden Laboratories in 1980. BHK (baby hamster kidney) cells are Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells without endogenous TfR. Sf9 cells were grown in Grace's supplemented insect medium (Gibco) with 10% FCS at 28\u00b0C. High Five cells were grown in Express5 serum-free medium (Gibco) at 28\u00b0C. quantification of TfR expression on transfected TRVb cells. TRVb cells expressing the feline, canine, raccoon, or black-backed TfR were seeded at 2 104 cells/cm2 in 96-well plates. two hundred TCID50 units (measured on TRVb cells expressing the feline TfR) of CPV-2, FPV, A300D CPV-2, or CPV-2a were added to each TfR-expressing TRVb cell line. mutant VP2, asn93Lys VP2 and the three mutant forms were prepared as VLPs by expression of VP2 in High Five cells and purified as described previously (41). plasmid clone containing the soluble human TfR ectodomain (residues 121 to 760 [the C terminus]) fused to a 6His tag on its N terminus was obtained from Ann Mason, University of Vermont (72) the heavy and light variable domains of two previously characterized monoclonal antibodies, a mouse IgG-2a anti-CPV antibody, Mab14 (73), and a rat IgG-2b anti-FPV antibody, MabE (45), were joined by a linker sequence of three repeats of Gly-Gly-Ser to prepare an scFv. the scFv was joined through its C terminus to the Fc domain of human Ig incompletely cleaved proteins were removed via size exclusion chromatography. Fabs were then concentrated using an Amicon 10-kDa centrifugal filter. determination of protein purity and VLP stability was determined by silver staining samples run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. basic binding experiments to determine capsid-TfR or capsid-scFv-Fc affinity were performed with the following protocol. TfRs in supernatant were loaded onto Ni-NTA biosensors to a consistent binding level of 0.8 nm. purified scFv-Fcs were loaded to approximately 0.4 nm (0.83 g/ml of protein) cells were then incubated with 10 g/ml CPV-2 empty capsids diluted in DMEM with 0.1% BSA for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were then stained with anti-capsid monoclonal antibody 8. additional coverslips were permeabilized in PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 after fixation and stained with a mouse anti-TfR cytoplasmic tail antibody. the number of copies of TfR bound to each capsid was approximated by comparing binding of TfR to TfR/CPV complexes with binding of Fab14 to scFv-Fc14/CPV complexes. levels of ligand binding (His tag-cleaved TfR or Fab14) were normalized relative to the loading of CPV onto biosensors and adjusted to account for the difference in molecular weight between the Tf complexes were incubated with either 4,800 nM FabE or Fab14 for 300 s. three independent replicates were performed, and binding at 300 s and 600 s was analyzed via ANOVA. effects of initial CPV-ligand binding interaction on subsequent binding of TfR. clone BTI-TN-551-4 was used to prepare infectious viruses and capsids. TRVb cells were grown in 1:1 McCoy\u2019s/Leibovitz\u2019s L15 medium (Corning) with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) a mouse anti-TfR cytoplasmic tail antibody (QB213080; Life Technologies) and a goat anti-mouse Alexa 488-conjugated antibody (A11029; Life Technologies) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with a goat anti-mouse Alexa 488-conjugated antibody (A11029; Life Technologies) FPV, A300D CPV-2, or CPV-2a were added to each TfR-expressing TRVb cell line. cells were incubated for 2 days at 37\u00b0C at 37\u00b0C. a plasmid clone containing the human TfR ectodomain fused to a plasmid clone containing the human TfR ectodomain. plasmid was stably transfected into BHK cells using transit-X2 (Mirus) the ectodomain was secreted into the culture medium. clones expressed the feline, canine, black-backed jackal, and raccoon TfR ectodomains were produced. scFv-Fc was isolated from supernatant with protein G affinity chromatography. eluted at pH 3.0, and immediately neutralized with Tris-HCl to pH 7.0. incompletely cleaved proteins were removed via size exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G100 (Pharmacia) column in PBS. silver staining samples run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels with a Pierce silver stain kit. stability of mutant VLPs was determined by differential scanning fluorimetry. three replicates were performed for each sample except for the N93K VLPs. TfRs in supernatant were loaded onto Ni-NTA biosensors to a consistent binding level of 0.8 nm. purified scFv-Fcs were loaded to approximately 0.4 nm (0.83 g/ml of protein) comparison of binding affinities of feline, canine, raccoon, black-backed jackal and human TfRs. additional coverslips were permeabilized in PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 after fixation and stained with a mouse anti-TfR cytoplasmic tail antibody. CPV capsids were first immobilized on biosensors with either scFv-Fcs or TfRs, exactly as in the basic binding experiments described above and in Fig. 1G and I and 2A. Fab14 saturated our system at 50 Fabs/capsid due to steric hindrance of scFv-Fc14 holding capsids to biosensors. scFv-Fc14, scFv-FcE, feline TfR, or black-backed jackal TfR were used to attach capsids to biosensors. after a 300-s wash step, complexes were incubated with either scFc-Fc14, feline TfR, or black-backed jackal TfR were bound to biosensors. the concentrations of these ligands were adjusted so that all three ligands bound 1 nm of CPV-2 capsids to biosensors. binding at 300 s and 600 s was analysed via ANOVA."}
