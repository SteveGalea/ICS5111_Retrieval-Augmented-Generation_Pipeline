{"summary": "chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a member of the togaviridae family, genus Alphavirus. CHIKV was implicated in large-scale outbreaks in africa and Asia in 2004 (3). pathogenesis of CHIKV is predominately characterized by an incubation period of 3\u20137 days followed by acute, febrile illness. termination codon in the genomic RNA begins at nucleotide 5656. a closely associated downstream stimulatory element is thought to prevent efficient association of the eRF1\u2013eRF3 complex with the ribosomes stalled at this codon. substitutions to amber or ochre stop codons or an arginine read-through have been associated with lowered transmission in mosquito vectors and significantly attenuated pathogenesis. these findings suggest that ablation of recoding elements could serve as the foundation for live-attenuated vaccines for this virus family. the observed recoding efficiencies were genetically verified. a 1 PRF located in the 3\u2032 region of the 6K viroporin gene enables synthesis of a C-terminally extended trans-frame variant dubbed TF. the presence of the TCR signal 3\u2032 of nsP3 and the 1 PRF signal in the 3\u2032 region of 6K are identified. a prior analysis revealed considerable amounts of heterogeneity among these strains throughout their genomes. the opal termination codon is universally conserved in both consensus sequences. five polymorphisms were identified in the downstream sequence predicted to harbor the accompanying TCR stimulatory element. the sequences of downstream stimulatory structures diverged by only a single nucleotide. average Af/As and Carib TCR efficiencies were in the range of 7.0 and 7.1% in HEK293T cells and 13.4 and 13.7% in U-87 MG cells. no significant differences in TCR efficiency were recorded between the Af/As and Carib geographic variants of CHIKV. the predicted TCR and 1 PRF signals identified in Fig. 1 were cloned into pJD2257 dual-Luciferase reporter vectors. their ability to promote efficient recoding was monitored in HEK293T cells, human kidney and astrocyte cell lines. site-directed mutagenesis was used to test the effects of targeted CHIKV mutations on translational recoding efficiencies in HEK293T cells. a significant decrease in efficient TCR in mammalian cell lines was observed when the termination codon was substituted with more frequently used UAA and UAG stop codons. silent coding mutations to the slippery site of the CHIKIV TCR signal promoted reduced viral pathogenesis. ssM that replaced the UUU UUA sequence with G UUC UUG was also created. mutants were assayed in HEK293T and MG cell lines. ssM was used to replace the UGA stop codon in both CHIKV TCR sequences with AGA. a large, terminally forked stem-loop structure was identified 3\u2032 of the opal termination codon for both the Af/As and Carib variants of the CHIKV TCR signal. a smaller bulged stem-loop structure was also identified as the cis-acting element located downstream of the CHIKV 1 PRF slippery sequence. CHIKV translational recoding sequences are highly conserved Alphaviruses have single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes that contain two large open reading frames (ORFs) the first ORF encodes a polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into the nonstructural proteins nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4. the presence of the TCR signal 3\u2032 of nsP3 and the 1 PRF signal in the 3\u2032 region of 6K are identified. the oval chains below denote the two polyproteins that can be synthesized from both the nonstructural and structural ORFs. the proteins that are encoded by TCR (nsP4) or 1 PRF (TF) are shaded. both CHIKV 1 PRF consensus sequences diverged by only a single nucleotide. only the Af sequence of the CHIKV 1 PRF signal was selected as a representative. CHIKV-derived sequences promote efficient recoding in mammalian cell lines. average CHIKV 1 PRF efficiency was lower, 1.8% in HEK293T cells and 4.5% in HEK293T cells. but all of these values were statistically significantly greater than the 5\u2032-UAA control (1% in both cell lines) muLV and VEEV were used as positive controls for efficient TCR and 1 PRF as well as a negative control consisting of a UAA termination codon in the 0 frame. CHIKV recoding signals were cloned into dual reporter control vectors containing a premature termination codon. silent coding mutations to the slippery site of the 1 PRF signal resulted in significantly decreased frameshifting efficiency (1.0%). substitution of an arginine codon for the UGA codon of the CHIKIV TCR signals promoted reduced viral pathogenesis (13) sequences from muLV and VEEV were used as positive TCR and 1 PRF controls. asterisks denote statistical significance where * represents p 0.05 and ** represents p 0.01. each point represents a biological replicate assayed as technical triplicates. the predicted organization and folding of this element are very similar to the minimal structures required for efficient 1 PRF in the equine encephalitic virus family of alphaviruses (21). RNA templates containing translational recoding sequences were transcribed from corresponding Dual-Luciferase reporter vectors and treated with NMIA. the CHIKV 1 PRF signal is very similar to those characterized in the new world encephalitic alphaviruses (21). Specifically, the predicted CHIKV TCR signal was also shown to promote recoding in mammalian cells at a efficiency similar to that of Sindbis virus, another Old World alphavirus (20). a second set of insights stems from the observation that the CHIKV 1 PRF signal promotes relatively low rates of recoding. it is possible that this element may be involved in long-range interactions that, by rendering it more difficult to unwind, would increase ribosome pause rates. RNA\u2013RNA interactions are critical for programming the fundamental molecular processes of (+)-single-stranded RNA viruses. these include the switch from translation to transcription, cap-independent translation, genome circularization, replicase complex assembly, subgenomic mRNA synthesis, and repriming during discontinuous template synthesis. a deeper understanding of such interactions will require studies examining RNA structural dynamics of the genomic RNA, subgenomic RNA, and ()-strand lower rates of 1 PRF correlate with decreased pathogenicity in west Nile virus (53), and production of the NS1\u2032 frameshift product is critical for neuroinvasiveness in west Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses (54). the RNA folding algorithm NUPACK (60) was used to model downstream RNA secondary structures of these recoding signals. DNA sequences harboring the CHIKV recoding signals containing 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 overlapping sequences with pJD2257 were designed in silico. the cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. the cells were seeded at 0.6 105 cells in 0.5 ml/well for 24-well plates. control and experimental reporter plasmids were assayed. post-transfection, and lysates were prepared using nonidet P-40 lysis buffer from Boston BioProducts. protein concentrations were determined, and 15\u201320 g of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE (4\u201315% gels from Bio-Rad, catalogue number 4568084) and then transferred to 0.45-m nitrocellulose membranes from Fisher. DNA templates for in vitro transcription reactions were generated by PCR amplification using Dream Taq DNA polymerase from Thermo Fisher (catalogue number FERK1071PM) complementary primers for the Renilla and firefly regions were used to amplify the inserted CHIKV sequence and attach a T7 promoter sequence to the 5\u2032 end of the amplicons. RNA sequences for the CHIKV 1 PRF and TCR signals were imported into the MC-Fold program. highest-scoring model was selected to represent the predicted three-dimensional structure of the viral PRF signals. Accession numbers of CHIKV sequences isolated from patients of either africa-Asian origin (n = 14) or Caribbean origin (n = 5) were considered for phylogenetic analysis. translation recoding rates were monitored using pJD2257-based dual-Luciferase vectors. DNA sequences harboring the CHIKV recoding signals containing 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 overlapping sequences with pJD2257 were designed in silico and synthesized by Genewiz. HEK293T or U-87 MG cells were seeded at 0.6 105 cells in 0.5 ml/well for 24-well plates for Dual-Luciferase transfections. 1 106 cell in 2 ml/well for 6-well plates for BiFl transfections in appropriate complete growth media. control and experimental reporter plasmids were then transfected into cells using lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent from Thermo Fisher. protein concentrations were determined, and 15\u201320 g of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE. post-transfer membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat skim milk in 1 PBST (1 PBS, 0.5% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. DNA templates for in vitro transcription reactions were generated by PCR amplification using Dream Taq DNA polymerase from Thermo Fisher. complementary primers for the Renilla and firefly regions were used to amplify the inserted CHIKV sequence and attach a T7 promoter sequence to the 5\u2032 end of the amplicons. the quality of the RNA samples was assessed through urea-PAGE. modeling of CHIKV 1 PRF and TCR stimulatory elements All-atom models were generated using the MC-Fold and MC-Sym pipeline programs (65). RNA sequences for the CHIKV 1 PRF and TCR signals were imported into the MC-Fold program to generate a series of secondary structures as described previously (21).
