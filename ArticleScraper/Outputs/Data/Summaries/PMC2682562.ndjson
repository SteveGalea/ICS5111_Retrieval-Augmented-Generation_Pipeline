{"summary": "single mAbs in immune prophylaxis can be protective against H5N1 infection. but a single mAb may not be effective in neutralizing a broad range of different strains of H5N1 and control of potential neutralization escape mutants. the combination of chimeric mAbs when administered passively, pre or post challenge with 10 MLD50 (50% mouse lethal dose) antiviral therapy has received much attention during these situations. currently available anti-viral treatment options are limited. passive administration of antibodies against neutralizing epitopes of H5N1 may be attractive alternative to active vaccination of humans. the efficacy of these mAbs was hampered by several problems including their diminished serum half-life and the development of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) there has been a lot of focus on therapeutic approaches using neutralizing antibodies against the HA1 protein of the influenza virus. human influenza viruses from clade 2.1 A/Indonesia/CDC669/2006, A/Indonesia/TLL013/2006, A/Indonesia/CDC540/2006, A/Indonesia/CDC594/2006 and one avian strain A/Indonesia/TLL014/2006 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, Republic of Indonesia. at 72 h post-transfection the culture medium was inoculated into embryonated eggs or MDCK cells. the HA and NA genes of reassortant viruses from the second passage were sequenced to confirm presence of introduced HA and NA genes. reassortant viruses were generated by reverse genetics. mAbs BALB/c mice were immunized twice subcutaneously at intervals of 2 weeks with purified formalin inactivated A/Indonesia/CDC669/2006 or A/Indonesia/TLL014/2006 antigen with adjuvant. the fused cells were seeded in 96-well plates, and their supernatants were screened by immunofluorescence assays. oma culture supernatant at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated with a 140 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Immunoglobulin (Dako, Denmark) cells were rinsed again in PBS and antibody binding was evaluated by wide-field epi-fluorescence microscopy. human antibody constant regions encoding the kappa light chain and the IgG1 heavy chain were amplified and cloned into a modified pCMV/myc/ER plasmid. mRNA was prepared from the mAb 4C2 and 2D9 hybridoma cells. the resultant products were cloned into pCR-Script (Stratagene, USA) for sequencing. chimeric antibodies against H5N1 strains were confirmed by SDS-PAGE. immunoblot analysis using HRP labeled anti-human Ig (DAKO) was used to confirm introduction of human constant regions. 5 mg/kg of an irrelevant IgG1 monoclonal antibody 8C2 prepared in a similar manner was used to measure any non-specific protection. each group of mice was experimentally infected with 10 MLD50 of the two different H5N1 strains. l Dulbecco's DMEM supplemented with antibiotic-antimycotic solution achieved 10-fold serially diluted suspensions of lung samples. the viral titers were calculated by using the method of Reed and Muench method [27] and expressed as log10 TCID50/gram of tissue S.E. clades 0, 1, 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4, 7 and 8 genes were synthesized. the synthetic HA and NA genes were cloned into a dual-promoter plasmid for influenza A reverse genetics. reassortant viruses were rescued by transfecting plasmids containing HA and NA. mAbs BALB/c mice were immunized twice subcutaneously at intervals of 2 weeks with purified formalin inactivated A/Indonesia/CDC669/2006 or A/Indonesia/TLL014/2006 antigen with adjuvant. mice were boosted with the same viral antigen 3 days before the fusion of splenocytes with SP2/0 cells. immunoglobulins from selected positive mAbs were isotyped using a commercial isotyping kit. mAbs were serially diluted (2 fold) in 96-well plates and mixed with 4 HA units of virus. the hemagglutination inhibition endpoint was the highest mAb dilution in which agglutination was not observed. mAb 2D9 and 4C2 were mapped by characterization of escape mutants. h5N1 viruses were incubated with an excess of mAb for 1 h. the eggs were inoculated into 11 day old embryonated chicken eggs. expression of chimeric antibodies leads to the production of chimeric antibodies containing 33% of the sequences as mouse variable regions from murine. chimeric antibodies were transfected into 293-F cells using 293fectin (Invitrogen, USA) and supernatants were collected 120 h after transfection. each group of mice was experimentally infected with 10 MLD50 of the two different H5N1 strains. mice were pre-treated intraperitoneally with 1.0 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg or 0 mg/kg (PBS) of the combination of ch-mAbs, prior to the viral challenge. one additional group of mice was challenged with 10 MLD50 of H5N1 virus from clade 2.1 and treated one day after viral challenge with ch-mAb 2D9. separate sets of mice were maintained for each experimental group infected with clade 1.0 for determination of viral titers. mAbs 2D9 and 4C2 were chosen for further studies due to their high HI activity against a wide range of rescued reassortant viruses from different clades. the amino acids involved in forming the epitopes of the mAbs were analyzed using selection of neutralization escape mutants. similar analysis for mAb 4C2 revealed the involvement of amino acid 155 (Ser to Asn) in forming the epitope. 5N1 strain Clade HI titers of the mAbs 2D9a 4C2a 2D9+4C2b A/Hongkong/156/97 0 128 256 256 A/Vietnam/1203/04 1 512 256 512 A/Indonesia/TLL014/06 2.1 128 256 256 A/Indonesia/CDC540/06 2.1 256 8 128 A chimeric monoclonal antibodies (ch-mAbs) were generated for both the mAbs. the constant regions were replaced with those from human origin. the chimeric antibodies still retained the original properties of the murine mAbs. negative control group of mice (n = 10) were pre-treated with a single dose of 5 mg/kg ch-mAbs. this concentration provided 100% protection against 10 MLD50 of both clades of viruses. ch-mAbs at 2.5 mg/kg provided sufficient protection (90%) in a dose dependent manner. the results are expressed in terms of percent survival and percent body weight. groups of mice treated with either single dose or double dose of ch-mAbs lost less than 5% of their original body. group of mice (n = 10) were infected with mouse-adapted HPAI H5N1 from Clade 1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (A and C) and clade 2.1 virus A/TLL013/06 (B and D) for treatment with a single dose, 24 h and 72 h after the viral challenge, the mice were treated twice with similar doses of chimeric mAbs. two doses of combination of ch-mAbs could provide 80% protection against 10 MLD 50 of both H5N1 viruses. lungs of untreated mice or mice treated with irrelevant mAb had pulmonary lesions consisting of moderate to severe necrotizing bronchitis and moderate to severe histiocytic alveolitis. mice treated with two doses of 5 mg/kg of ch-mAbs at 24 h and 72 h post infection were treated with similar doses of chimeric mAbs 24 h and 72 h after the viral challenge. the virus titers were highest in the infected but untreated control on day 3 after viral challenge. the lower limit of detection was 1.5 log10 TCID50/g(S.E) Escape mutants were isolated from the lungs of 20% of the mice after treatment with single dose of ch-mAbs, even at concentrations of 5 mg/kg. most of the individual mice showed single point mutants that escaped the mAb. similar analysis for mAb 4C2 revealed the involvement of amino acid 155 (Ser to Asn) in forming the epitope. the two mAbs were found to recognize non-overlapping epitopes and reacted with all the H5N1 viruses from different clades available in our laboratory. chimeric monoclonal antibodies (ch-mAbs) were generated for both the mAbs such that the constant regions were replaced with those from human origin. the chimeric antibodies still retained the original properties of the murine mAbs. ers dropped a little compared to the murine mAbs but still retained significant viral neutralization activity. mAbs 2D9+4C2 ch-mAbsb straina Clade Microneutralization titers. ch-mAbs at 2.5 mg/kg provided sufficient protection (90%) in a dose dependent manner. mice in these groups showed a loss of body weight of up to 15%. ch-mAbs could provide 60% and 70% protection against clade 1. groups of mice (n = 10) were infected with mouse-adapted HPAI H5N1 from clade 2.1 virus A/TLL013/06. mice were treated via intra-peritoneal route with 2.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 0 mg/kg (PBS) of a single ch-mAb 2D9. 80% and 50% of the mice could be protected with 5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg of therapeutic antibody respectively. groups of mice (n = 10) were infected with mouse-adapted HPAI H5N1 from Clade 1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (A and C) and clade 2.1 virus A/TLL013/06 (B and D) for treatment with a single dose, 24 h after viral challenge, the mice were treated twice with similar doses of chimeric mAbs 24 h and 72 h after the viral challenge. on day 6 p.i., lungs of untreated mice or mice treated with irrelevant mAb had pulmonary lesions consisting of moderate to severe necrotizing bronchitis, moderate to severe histiocytic alveolitis with associated pulmonary edema. mice treated with two doses of 5 mg/kg showed no lung pathology. mice treated with 2 doses of 1 mg/kg showed undetectable viral titers by day 6. but on day 6, the mice treated with 2 doses of 1 mg/kg had much lower viral titers than those treated with single doses. a double dose of the mAb combination could neutralize the virus much efficiently than a single dose. most of the individual mice (75%) showed single point mutants that escaped the mAb and very few mice (25%) showed escape mutants with mutations at two points (Ser155 and Arg189). most of the influenza vaccines target this protein to induce immune responses in the host, mostly in the form of neutralizing antibody based response. mAbs 2D9 and 4C2 could neutralize all of the strains from phylogenetically distinct clades 0, 1, 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4, 7 and 8. in combination, mAbs 2D9 and 4C2 could neutralize all of the strains from phylogenetically distinct clades 0, 1, 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4, 7 and 8. s in vivo in 100% of cases whenever a single monoclonal antibody was used for therapy. however, using higher concentrations in a single dose (5 mg/kg) reduced this possibility. this may have been dependent on the amount of the complementary circulating mAb present in the system which could effectively neutralize the escape mutants due to any one of the mAb. combination therapy may allow for a lower dose of antibody to be administered for passive therapy of influenza infection. in future, it may be possible to generate humanized monoclonal antibodies of mAb 2D9 and 4C2
