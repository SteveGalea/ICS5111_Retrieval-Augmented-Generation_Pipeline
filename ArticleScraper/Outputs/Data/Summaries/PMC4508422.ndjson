{"summary": "lower respiratory infections (LRIs) remain among the top five causes of death worldwide, killing 3.1 million people in 2012. many pathogens, especially respiratory viruses, are associated with respiratory infections. traditional methods do not provide complete and reliable etiological information. all nasal and throat swabs were obtained from our institute collections. they were collected from adults or children with suspected viral acute respiratory tract infections between January 2013 and November 2013. in an exploratory test, the target genes of each respiratory virus were amplified by RT-PCR/PCR. ds (500 copies per reaction) contain specific inserts of each target respiratory virus. each plasmid concentration was tested in triplicate. 102 clinical samples were confirmed positive for 21 common respiratory viruses. representative respiratory virus strains used in the CRV-MS method design are shown in Table S1 in the supplemental material. the nucleotide sequences of these representative respiratory virus strains were downloaded from the GenBank database. all nasal and throat swabs were obtained from our institute collections. these samples were collected from adults or children with suspected viral acute respiratory tract infections between January 2013 and November 2013. informed consent was obtained from all patients or from the parents of all of the children who provided specimens. the CRV-MS method was designed using massARRAY assay design 4.0 software. the nucleotide sequences of these representative respiratory virus strains were downloaded from the GenBank database. PCR was performed using the FastStart high-fidelity PCR system. amplified DNA was purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit. differences between detection rates of the two methods were tested. the sensitivity test indicated that the detection limit of the CRV-MS method is approximately 10 to 100 DNA copies. the results showed that all tested primers and probes worked well. for any tested respiratory virus, there was no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses. the CRV-MS and consensus PCR/RT-PCR methods detected respiratory viruses in 92.5% (307/332) and 89.5% (297/332) of the samples. the multiple-respiratory virus detection rate did not differ significantly between the two methods. the difference between the two methods may reflect their sensitivities. the difference between the two methods may reflect their different sensitivities. flu-A, influenza virus A; flu-B, influenza virus B; HBoV, human bocavirus; HCoV, human coronavirus; HEV, human enterovirus; HRV, human rhinovirus; PIV, parainfluenza virus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus. the CRV-MS method can detect 21 common respiratory viruses. for flu-A virus, our new method can detect Flu-A H1N1, Flu-A H1N1pdm09, and Flu-A H3N2. a total of 336 nasal and throat swabs were analyzed using the CRV-MS method. the results were compared to those from the consensus PCR/RT-PCR analysis. the CRV-MS and consensus PCR/RT-PCR methods detected respiratory viruses in 92.5% (307/332) and 89.5% (297/332) of the samples. the respiratory virus detection rate differed significantly between the two methods. 1N1pdm09/HCoV-NL63 1 Flu-A H3N2/HEV 1 Flu-A H3N2/HMPV-A 1 Flu-B/PIV1 1 Flu-B/RSV-B 1 HBoV1/HEV 2 HBoV-229E/HEV 1 HCoV-229E/RSV-A 2 HCoV-229E/RSV-B 4 HCoV-HKU1/PIV3 2 results of two methods Sample CRV-MS resulta Consensus PCR/RT-PCR result S1 AdV S2 HRV S3 HEV S4 HEV S5 HEV S6 HEV S7 HEV S8 HEV S9 HEV S10 HEV S11 HCoV-229E/HRV/PIV3/HEV HCoV-229E/HRV/PIV3 S12 HCoV-229E/RSV-A/HEV multiplex PCR/RT-PCR is more sensitive and efficient in detecting a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses. sensitivity of these methods will be decreased if multiple respiratory viruses are present in one sample. several commercial methods for multiple respiratory virus detection have been developed. a 24-plex assay can detect and identify 21 common respiratory viruses simultaneously in one reaction. the CRV-MS method can be a useful alternative for those samples suspected to contain multiple respiratory viruses. the turnaround time of CRV-MS method is longer than FilmArray and ResPlex II. the cost for analyzing all 21 common respiratory viruses using the CRV-MS method is $4."}
