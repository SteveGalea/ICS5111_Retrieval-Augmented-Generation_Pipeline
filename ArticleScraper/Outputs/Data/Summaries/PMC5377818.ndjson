{"summary": "the threat of influenza infection is felt globally. the disease leads to an estimated 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and about 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths each year (1). the need for effective antiviral agents is underscored by the toxic side effects of currently available drugs. M2 is a minor protein of the viral envelope that forms a homotetramer in its native state (19, 20) it is an ion channel that was initially discovered as the target of the antiviral drug amantadine. it facilitates diffusion of protons to the interior of the endosomally entrapped virus (21) a human placenta complementary DNA library was uncovered as a novel host factor interacting with M2-CT. the physical interaction between M2 and cyclin D3 was confirmed in virus-infected cells. cyclin D3 restricts IAV production, independent of its role in the cell cycle. a random-primed cDNA library from human placenta was screened by Y2H using the IAV M2-CT as bait. the screening revealed human cyclin D3 as one of the most prominent interactors of M2-CT. cyclin D3 is responsible for binding to and activation of cyclin-dependent kinases. incubated with either naked beads, GST control (GST) or GST fused to the cytoplasmic tail of A/WSN/33 virus M2 protein (GST-M2-CT) results are representative of three and two independent experiments for cyclin D3 and cyclin D1 pull-down. the degree of association of M2 with cyclin D1 was around 50% that of cyclin D3 when the same amount of cyclins was immunoprecipitated. weak binding of M2 to cyclin D2 and cyclin E1 plays a role in the cell cycle clock one step later than D-type cyclins. GST-M2-CT fusion protein was purified and incubated with wild-type cell lysate to pull down endogenous cyclins. the results confirm that cyclin D3 binds to the IAV M2-CT. co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed from virus-infected cells. IAV Infection Induces Cyclin D3 Relocalization and Targets it for Proteasomal Degradation. cyclin D3 resides both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. cyclin D3 is redistributed from the nucleus to the cytosol. cells were fected with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 0.5 or transfected with a plasmid expressing M2 protein. at 24 h after infection or transfection, cells were fixed for immunofluorescence staining. to address the reduction of cyclin D3 from the nucleus upon virus infection, we fractionated both control and infected cells into cytosol and nuclear material. total intracellular level of cyclin D3 in virus-infected cells decreased to 60% of that observed in mock-infected cells. percentage of nuclear cyclin D3 dropped to 4% at 8 h p.i. most of cyclin D3 is degraded, we treated mock- and virus-infected cells with MG-132 to increase the signal strength of cyclin D3. at 15 h p.i., we could capture colocalization of influenza M2 and cyclin D3 along the secretory pathway. cyclin E exists as multiple proteins ranging in size from Mr 35,000 to 50,000 in tumor cell lines. only one band size of cyclin E was shown in their study, although the same cell type was used. immunoblots for cyclin D3 levels (normalized to GAPDH) results are representative of three independent experiments. MG-101 and MG-132 treatments blocked cyclin D3 degradation by 50 and 60%. viral infection also resulted in cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6 down-regulation on protein level. protein levels could not be rescued by protease and calpain inhibitor. findings suggest that IAV posts a cyclin D3-specific effect during infection. our data indicate that IAV infection results in reduced cyclin D3 levels in the nucleus of virus-infected cells. this phenotype is triggered by translocation of nuclear cyclin D3 into the cytoplasm, where IAV facilitates proteasomal degradation of cytoplasmic cyclin D3. cyclin D3 is actively removed from the nucleus and degraded by the proteasome in virus-infected cells. percentages of cells in G1 phase exhibited a progressive, time-dependent drop from 83.0 2.1 to 80.1 0.9%. this reduction reflects progression of cells through G1 phase. cells infected by A/WSN/33 virus remained in G1. cell cycle pattern of mock- and virus-infected cells presynchronized in G2/M phase with RO-3306. results are representative of three independent experiments. cells were preaccumulated in G2/M phase by treatment with CDK1 inhibitor. percentage of cells representing G0/G1 phase dropped from 85 to 65% in the control sample, whereas it remained constant in IAV-infected cells. IAV infection perturbs normal cell cycle progression in human cell lines and installs a block at G0/G1 phase. whole cell lysates were prepared from both infected and uninfected cells to determine the phosphorylation status of Rb and levels of CDK inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1. results are representative of three independent experiments. expression levels of p16 from the INK4 family of CKI were also measured. IAV infection down-regulates cyclin D3 levels, which in turn inhibits CDK4/6 activation. pRb sequesters the transcription factor E2F, which prevents cell cycle entry into S phase. the difference in production of H5N1 virus was less significant at 48 h p.i. (2.5-fold), most likely due to the cytopathic effect of H5N1 virus in a limited cell culture system. western blotting was used to determine expression levels of cyclin D3 and cyclin D1. a549 cells were fixed in 70% ethanol 72 h after siRNA treatment. the cell cycle pattern of each group was quantitated through BrdU incorporation and 7-aminoactinomycin D DNA content staining. a second siRNA duplex specific for cyclin D3 (CCND3 #2) induced cell cycle arrest at the G1/S interface without affecting cyclin D3 levels. both individual siRNAs and siRNA combinations resulted in significant reduction of desired gene expressions. cyclin D3 mRNA was expressed at lower levels compared with the other two cyclins in both cell types. cyclin D3 expression could be detected in the two primary cells but not in A549. whole cell lysates of A549 cells, HBECs, and pneumocytes were extracted to determine the protein levels of the designated cyclins. western blotting was used to determine the expression levels of cyclin D3 in HBEC. cyclin D3 deficiency does not affect viral protein synthesis. whole cell lysates were collected at 3, 6, 9, and 12 h after infection. levels of viral nucleoprotein, M1 and M2 were determined through Western blotting. a reduction of 70% in binding of cyclin D3 was observed when cyclin D3 was overexpressed. an isotype control antibody used in parallel did not bind to M1. cyclin D3 impairs interaction between viral M2 and M1 proteins. cyclin D3-deficient cells were infected with A/WSN/33. plasma membrane expression of viral M2 protein was detected by flow cytometry at 6 and 8 h after infection. overexpression of cyclin D3 resulted in both M1 and M2 being predominantly confined to the early secretory network compared with control cells with endogenous cyclin D3 levels. this effect occurs through a different mechanism because M2 surface expression remained unaffected in cells depleted of cyclin E1 (data not shown) cyclin D3 is responsible for binding to and activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (33, 34) and also the region in which the greatest homology occurs among the D-type cyclins (35). this finding, together with the absence of other cyclins among positive clones, suggests a certain degree of specificity of the interaction. HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged cyclins 48 h before infection with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 2. cells were lysed at 6 h after infection and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG or isotype control antibodies. yeast two-hybrid screen identifies/predicts cyclin D3-M2-CT interaction. cyclin D3 binds specifically to GST-M2-CT and not to GST or beads. HEK 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding cyclin D3 (cyclin D3-FLAG) and infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with anti-M2 antibody. no interaction was observed in control samples, where cells were either mock-transfected and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. cells were fixed at 24 h postinfection (p.i.) and stained for cyclin D3 and M2 proteins. cyclin D3 resides both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm with only the nuclear CDK4/6-cyclin D3 complex displaying retinoblastoma (Rb)-directed kinase activity (44). cyclin D3 translocates from nucleus to cytoplasm after viral infection. left, cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions of virus-infected cells were prepared from A549 cells 8 h after infection. total intracellular level of cyclin D3 in virus-infected cells decreased to 60% of that observed in mock-infected cells. 10% of total cyclin D3 was found in the nucleus of uninfected cells. the induction of D-type cyclins is growth factor-dependent. mRNAs and proteins exhibit moderate oscillations in continuously proliferating cell populations. cyclin D3 and another cell cycle G1 phase regulator, cyclin E, were measured through immunoblotting. IAV infection specifically deregulates components in the early G1 phase (G0/G1 phase) of the cell cycle machinery. top, cells were lysed at specified time points, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Western blotting. results are representative of three independent experiments. MG-101, also known as calpain inhibitor I, inhibits proteasome and calpain activities. calpain is a calcium-dependent protease that produces limited proteolysis of its substrates. resulting fragments are further degraded by other proteolytic pathways, including proteasome (52). IAV infection reduces protein level of cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6. cells were lysed at specified time points, subjected to SDS-PAGE. results are representative of three independent experiments. the interaction between cyclin D3 and M2-CT during the viral life cycle implies a potential regulation of host cell cycle by IAV. this is supported by our observation that cyclin D3 is actively removed from the nucleus and degraded by the proteasome in virus-infected cells. a quantitative profiling of cell cycle kinetics was performed on virus-infected A549 cells. percentage of cells in G1 phase hovered above 80% at all time points. results show that IAV leads to cell cycle arrest in G0/G1. the line graph illustrates mean S.D. of three independent experiments. ***, p 0.001 versus mock at each time point by two-way ANOVA. cyclins activate CDK4/6, which initiate phosphorylation of Rb at multiple sites. hyperphosphorylated Rb releases transcription factor E2F and leads to activation and transcription of cell cycle progression-responsive genes (38, 57, 58) p21WAF1/CIP1 is targeted for proteolysis after viral infection. whole cell lysates were extracted at 9 h after infection for detection of p21WAF1/CIP1 protein levels. cyclin D3 levels inhibit CDK4/6 activation and ultimately results in reduced Rb phosphorylation. pRb sequesters the transcription factor E2F, which prevents cell cycle entry into S phase (58). siRNA CCND3 #1 effectively reduced endogenous cyclin D3 expression levels by >90% at 72 h post-transfection. whole cell lysates were prepared from A549 cells treated with the indicated siRNAs 72 h post-transfection. Western blotting was used to determine the expression levels of cyclin D3 and cyclin D1. cyclin D3 depletion in A549 cells increases progeny virus titer in supernatant. cells treated with indicated siRNAs were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus. 55% of cells were found in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. a concomitant knockdown of Ccnd3 alone arrested cell cycle progression in A549 cells with 65% (CCND3 #1) or 70% (CCDN3 #2) of cells in G0/G1 phase. cyclin D3 mRNA was expressed at lower levels compared with the other two D-type cyclins in both cell types. comparable protein amounts of cyclin D3 were detected in both primary cells but not in A549. cyclin D3 expression could be detected in the two primary cells but not in A549. whole cell lysates were prepared from HBECs cells 72 h after the designated siRNA treatment. western blotting was used to determine expression levels of cyclin D3 knockdown in HBEC. NT or cyclin D3 (CCND3 #2) siRNA-treated cells were infected with viruses at an MOI of 0.01. hek 293T cells were co-transfected with cyclin D3, M1, and M2 without exogenous cyclin D3. a reduction of 70% in binding of M1 to M2 was observed when cyclin D3 was overexpressed. cyclin D3 impairs interaction between viral M2 and M1 proteins. hek 293T cells were co-transfected with M1-HA and M2-FLAG. at 48 h post-transfection, cell lysates were collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation. cyclin D3-deficient cells and control cells were infected with A/WSN/33 to measure plasma membrane expression of viral M2 protein within one cycle of infection. overexpression of cyclin D3 resulted in both M1 and M2 being predominantly confined to the early secretory network compared with controls with endogenous cyclin D3 levels. a random-primed cDNA library from human placenta was screened by Y2H using the IAV M2-CT as bait. the screening revealed human cyclin D3 as one of the most prominent interactors of M2-CT. this finding suggests a certain degree of specificity of the interaction. the retinoblastoma (Rb)-binding LXCXE motif, the proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T)-rich PEST domain are shown. the retinoblastoma (Rb)-binding LXCXE motif, the proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T)-rich PEST results are representative of three independent experiments. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged cyclins 48 h before infection with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 2. interactions tested 63.89 million Prey Cyclin D3 No. of positive clones 42 Confidence scorea A Minimal interacting domain Amino acids 138\u2013251 a Predicted biological score (from A to E, highest to lowest), a statistical confidence score assigned to each interaction by Hybrigenics. no interaction was observed in control samples. cells were either mock-transfected and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody or transfected with cyclin D3-FLAG. cyclin D3 appears to interact with other cyclins to some degree when they are overexpressed. cyclin D3 is redistributed from the nucleus to the cytosol as a response to infection. the effect of M2 protein on cyclin D3 relocalization was recapitulated. cyclin D3 subcellular distribution is altered upon M2 expression. lamin B1 and GAPDH were used as markers to verify clear separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. both mock- and virus-infected groups were normalized to total cyclin D3 levels in uninfected cells. 10% of total cyclin D3 was found in the nucleus of uninfected cells. this is very likely an underestimation because cyclin D3 would leak from the nuclear into the cytoplasm during the experimental procedures. the expression profiles of cyclin D3 and another cell cycle G1 phase regulator, cyclin E, were measured through immunoblotting. a time course analysis revealed that the steady-state levels of cyclin D3 started declining at 6 h p.i. and decreased by 50% at 9 h p.i. cyclin D3 and cyclin E normalized to GAPDH. line graphs represent mean S.D. (error bars) from three independent experiments. MG-132 is a proteasome inhibitor that prevents degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins (54) uninfected cells were treated with the same drugs to control for the baseline oscillation of cyclin D3 levels. blocking proteasome activity led to a significant stabilization of cyclin D3 in virus-infected cells. cyclin D3 is specifically targeted for proteolysis after viral infection. whole cell lysates were extracted at 24 h p.i. for detection of protein levels. results are representative of three independent experiments. asynchronously growing cell population found that virus-infected cells accumulated at G1 phase when compared with the uninfected group. we first synchronized them before infection in G1 using lovastatin, a fungal metabolite shown to affect cell cycle distribution in a reversible manner. cells were released from the lovastatin block and stimulated with mevalonate at the time of infection. cell cycle pattern of mock- and virus-infected cell populations at 24 h after infection that were presynchronized in G0/G1 phase with lovastatin. results are representative of three independent experiments. cells were preaccumulated in G2/M phase by treatment with RO-3306, a CDK1 inhibitor (56) at 0 h p.i., both A/WSN/33-infected and control samples had comparable percentages of cells in all phases of the cell cycle. the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase dropped from 85 to 65% in the control sample. IAV infection inhibits hyperphosphorylation of Rb and down-regulates CDK inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1. whole cell lysates were prepared from both infected and uninfected cells. results are representative of three independent experiments. p21WAF1/CIP1 is a \u201cuniversal\u201d CKI that inhibits both cyclin and CDK subunits to install a p53-dependent G1 phase arrest (61). Interestingly, upon infection, p21WAF1/CIP1 was down-regulated through proteasomal degradation. no increase in p16INK4A was observed even after prolonged infection time. siRNA CCND3 #1 effectively reduced endogenous cyclin D3 expression levels by >90% at 72 h post-transfection. control (NT siRNA-treated) and cyclin D3-deficient cells were infected with A/WSN/33 at an MOI of 0.01 to allow multiple rounds of infection. cyclin D3-deficient cells were at least 10-fold greater than those from control cells. siRNA-treated cells were infected with viruses at an MOI of 0.01. progeny virus titers in cell culture supernatants were determined through a plaque assay. virus titers were determined by a plaque assay on MDCK cells. the bar graphs show the mean S.D. of three independent experiments. we used combinations of siRNAs targeting various steps in the cell cycle to modulate its progression. cells induced a more robust cell cycle G0/G1 phase accumulation than Ccnd3 knockdown with 80% cells in G0/G1 phase. despite the rescue in cell cycle progression, a double knockdown of Ccnd3/Rb1 did not normalize virus production when compared with NT siRNA-treated cells. titers from cells with Ccne1 knockdown were comparable with those from Ccnd3/Rb1 double knockdown. cyclin D3 expression could be detected in the two primary cells but not in A549. total RNA extracted from HBECs and pneumocytes was reverse transcribed into cDNA for quantitative PCR gene expression analysis. western blotting was used to determine protein levels of designated cyclins. virus titers in cell culture supernatants were determined through a plaque assay. the bar graphs depict the mean S.D. (error bars) of three independent experiments. hek 293T cells were co-transfected with cyclin D3, M1 and M2 without exogenous cyclin D3. a reduction of 70% in binding of cyclin D3 to M2 was observed when cyclin D3 was overexpressed. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with M1-HA and M2-FLAG. left, control and cyclin D3-deficient cells were infected with A/WSN/33. plasma membrane expression of viral M2 protein was detected by flow cytometry. cyclin D3-deficient cells were overexpressed with cyclin D3 protein 24 h before infection with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 2. cells were fixed at 10 h p.i. and immunostained with specific antibodies to reveal the subcellular localization of M1 (red) and M2 (green). this suggests that without the blockage imposed by cyclin D3, a greater amount of M2 could reach the cell surface and/or at a faster a random-primed cDNA library from human placenta was screened using the IAV M2-CT as bait. the screening revealed human cyclin D3 as one of the most prominent interactors of M2-CT. this finding suggests a certain degree of specificity of the interaction, which was tested in the next series of experiments. samples were incubated with either naked beads, GST control (GST) or GST fused to the cytoplasmic tail of A/WSN/33 virus M2 protein (GST-M2-CT) results are representative of three and two independent experiments for cyclin D3 and cyclin D1 pull-down, respectively. M2 was found to interact with all cyclins tested, albeit to different intensities. results are representative of three independent experiments. three early G1 phase cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) are functionally related with tissue-specific expression profiles. we first checked the specificity of this interaction in human epithelial cells. cyclin D3 bound specifically to GST-M2-CT. data validate cyclin D3 as a bona fide interactor of influenza M2. cyclin D3 appears to interact with other cyclins to some degree when they are overexpressed, but it has the strongest interaction with cyclin D3. cyclin D3 translocates from nucleus to cytoplasm after viral infection. phenotype induced by viral infection drives cyclin D3 redistribution from nucleus to cytoplasm. a549 cells expressing cyclin D3 were infected with virus at an MOI of 2. the subcellular localization of cyclin D3 (red) and M2 (green) was visualized through immunostaining with specific antibodies. this significant (>60%) reduction of nuclear cyclin D3 detected through biochemical measurement confirmed our immunofluorescence data on its subcellular relocalization. we further verified colocalization of cyclin D3 with that of M2 through infection of A/WSN/33 in cyclin D3-expressing cells. cyclin E, which is activated at the late stage of cell cycle G1 phase to facilitate G1/S transition, displayed only a moderate reduction under identical conditions. cyclin E exists as multiple proteins ranging in size from Mr 35,000 to 50,000 in tumor cell lines. cyclin D3 is targeted for proteolysis after viral infection. whole cell lysates were extracted at 9 h after infection. MG-101 or MG-132 inhibits proteasome activity. MG-132 treatments blocked cyclin D3 degradation by 50 and 60%, respectively, compared with the vehicle control-treated group. the level of down-regulation is not as robust as that of cyclin D3 when compared with cyclin D3. lysates were extracted at 24 h p.i. for detection of the protein levels of cell cycle regulators. results are representative of three independent experiments (normalized to GAPDH) the percentages of cells in G1 phase exhibited a progressive, time-dependent drop from 83.0 2.1 to 80.1 0.9%. the percentage of cells in G1 phase remained in G1 with the percentage of cells in G1 phase hovering above 80%. ***, p 0.001 versus mock at each time point by two-way ANOVA. D, IAV infection arrested cells in G0/G1 phase. CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 was used to accumulate A549 cells in G2/M. the cell cycle pattern of virus-infected cells showed lower peaks for both S and G2/M phases compared with uninfected cells. the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase dropped from 85 to 65% in the control sample, whereas it remained constant in IAV-infected cells. IAV infection inhibits hyperphosphorylation of Rb and down-regulates CDK inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1. whole cell lysates were prepared from both infected and uninfected cells. results are representative of three independent experiments. p21WAF1/CIP1 is a \u201cuniversal\u201d CKI that inhibits both cyclin and CDK subunits to install a p53-dependent G1 phase arrest (61). Interestingly, upon infection, p21WAF1/CIP1 was down-regulated through proteasomal degradation. expression levels of p16 from the INK4 family of CKI were also measured. titers obtained from cyclin D3-deficient cells were at least 10-fold greater than those from control cells. difference in production of H5N1 virus was less significant at 48 h p.i. (2.5-fold) the expression levels of Rb, cyclin E, cyclin D3, cyclin D1 and GAPDH proteins were determined by Western blotting. results are representative of three independent experiments. a concomitant knockdown of Ccnd3 and Rb1 rescued cells from the G0/G1 phase block imposed by cyclin D3 deficiency. we included a second siRNA duplex specific for cyclin D3 (CCND3 #2) both individual siRNAs and siRNA combinations resulted in significant reduction of the desired gene expressions. a 5-fold difference in viral titers persisted between control cells and those that harbored a double knockdown in Ccnd3/Rb1. to study whether the inhibitory role of cyclin D3 on viral replication is also applicable to the other IAV strains, two clinical isolates were tested. cyclin D3 expression could be detected in both primary cells but not in A549. total RNA extracted from HBECs and pneumocytes was reverse transcribed into cDNA for quantitative PCR gene expression analysis. total RNA extracted from HBECs and pneumocytes was reverse transcribed into cDNA for Taqman probe-based quantitative PCR gene expression analysis. we first measured whether viral protein synthesis was affected by cyclin D3. Knockdown cells did not display enhanced viral protein synthesis compared with control cells. cyclin D3 deficiency does not affect viral protein synthesis. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with cyclin D3, M1 and M2 without exogenous cyclin D3. the level of M1 that co-precipitated with M2 was significantly lower than the amount obtained in the absence of cyclin D3. precipitates were analyzed through Western blotting to detect M1, M2, and cyclin D3 proteins. results are shown as mean S.D. (error bars) of three independent experiments. more M2 was detected at the plasma membrane in cyclin D3-deficient cells. this suggests that without the blockage imposed by cyclin D3, a greater amount of M2 could reach the cell surface and/or at a faster pace, thus facilitating the recruitment of viral internal components to the plasma membrane. this could be observed at both time intervals, as described in Fig. 10B. a highly conserved LC3-interacting region in M2 promoted binding and relocalization of LC3 to the plasma membrane. this mechanism allowed subversion of autophagy and facilitated inter-organism viral transmission by enhancing the stability of progeny virions. sized cyclin D3 prevents it from translocating into the nucleus. a detailed mechanism of how cyclin D3 is targeted to the proteasome complex. cyclin D3 is retained by M2 in the cytoplasm after its nuclear export. a cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 by IAV infection was first reported by He et al. (49), although this phenomenon was not investigated in mechanistic terms. the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of IAV was later discovered to interact with and inhibit the activity of the Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) cyclin D3-M2 interaction masks the domain on M2 mediating binding to M1 or has a higher affinity than that between M1 and M2. cyclin D3-M2 interaction sequesters the amount of available M2. the current study includes cyclin D3 in the family of IAV budding inhibitors. the yeast strain was then transformed with pM2-CT bait plasmid and mated with Y187 yeast strain transformed by the prey library (82). Clone selection was performed on leucine, tryptophan, and histidine drop-out medium. sequences were compared with the most recently updated GenBankTM database by using BLASTN to decode interactions. viral inoculums were removed and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. three days after incubating the plates in an upside down manner, plaques were visualized. mouse anti-FLAG mAb (clone 14C2) and mouse anti-c-Myc mAb (clone 9E10) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; mouse anti-human pRb mAb (clone G99-549), mouse anti-Rb (ppRb Ser-780) mAb (clone J146-35), and mouse anti-Rb (ppRb Ser-807/Ser-811) mRb (clo co-immunoprecipitation HEK 293T cells were transfected with pCMV6-FLAG-c-Myc-CCND3 plasmid in a 10-cm dish. cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. cell extracts were incubated with anti-M2 (Santa Cruz) or isotype control antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C, followed by recovery of the immune complexes from whole cell lysates using protein G-Sepharose beads. cells were incubated in lovastatin for 22 h to achieve cell cycle synchronization. a549 cells were infected with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 2 or mock-infected. total DNA content was measured by 7-aminoactinomycin D (BD PharMingen) staining. cells were then immediately analyzed on a BD LSR II flow cytometer. DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich)-containing medium was used as vehicle control. whole cell lysates were collected 9 h after infection. cells were either mock- or virus-free. cells were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 at an MOI of 2. 10 h p.i. cells were collected for staining and confocal imaging of influenza M1 and M2. cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. RNA interference and Virus Infection All gene-specific siRNAs were purchased from the Faculty Imaging Core Facility of the University of Hong Kong. individual siRNAs against the 5\u2032-AAGGAUCUUUGUGGCCAAGGA-3\u2032 sequence (62) or 5\u2032-UGCGGAAGAUGCUGGCUUA-3\u2032 sequence (62) were provided as an siGENOME SMARTpool containing a mixture of four siRNAs targeting different sites of a single gene. cell lysates were prepared from individual wells at 3, 6, 9, and 12 h p.i. to study effect of cyclin D3 reduction on M2 plasma membrane expression. cells were incubated with virus at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h and replaced with fresh cell culture medium containing 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. real-time PCRs were performed in 25-l reactions containing fluorigenic Taqman probe at a final concentration of 400 nm together with an 800 nm concentration of each primer and 12.5 l of 2 Probe Master (Roche Applied Science) each sample was quantified in triplicate for each experiment.
