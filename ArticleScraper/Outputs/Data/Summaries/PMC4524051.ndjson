{"summary": "influenza viruses are responsible for acute respiratory diseases in humans. production of novel vaccines in the case of a pandemic requires at least 6 months. neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes are available against influenza virus. all animal experiments were approved by the relevant german authority. mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (70 mg/kg of body weight and 7 mg/kg, respectively) mice were humanely euthanized upon >25% weight loss. WT and 7/ murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin-streptomycin, l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids (PAA, Austria) and sodium pyruvate (PAA, Austria) a viral clone was isolated from the lung homogenates of the fifth passage by plaque purification from MDCK cells. pH1N1 and pH1N1-MA7 genes were cloned into the pHW2000 vector to generate recombinant influenza viruses by reverse genetics. reporter constructs pPol-I-NP-Luc-human (encoding firefly luciferase in negative polarity flanked by nontranslated regions of influenza NP segment) pRL-TK (encoding Renilla luciferase; Promega, USA) were cotransfected. supernatants were collected at 0.25 g/l l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin. total RNA was isolated at 24 h p.i. by extraction with TRIzol reagent. a template containing the region with the mutations was found with an E value of 0, which indicates the probability of a protein-template assignation due to chance. a total of 30 variants for each possible mutant of interest were created with Prosa. mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (70 mg/kg of body weight and 7 mg/kg respectively) and inoculated intranasally with 50 l of virus diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) survival and weight loss were monitored for 14 days. hairpin RNA (shRNA) anti-importin-7 generates knockdown cells. transduced cells were selected and maintained in medium containing 2 g/ml puromycin. shRNA-mediated knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting. PB1, PB2, PA, and NP genes from pH1N1 or pH1N1-MA7 viruses were cloned into the pHW2000 vector to generate recombinant influenza viruses. pC-HH15-PB1, pC-HH15-PB2, pC-HH15-PA, pC-HH15-NP, pC-HH15-PAMA7, or pC-HH15-NPMA7 expression plasmids luciferase activity was measured with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. all experiments were performed in triplicates. luciferase activity was measured with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. primer PrE-NP (5\u2032-ATGATGGAAAGTGCAAAGCC-3\u2032) was used to detect vRNA and primer PrE-NP+ (5\u2032-ATTTCTGTGGCATCC-3\u2032) to detect cRNA and mRNA. a primer detecting cellular 5S rRNA (5\u2032-TCCCAGGCGGTCCCATCC-3\u2032) was used for normalization. a total of 30 variants for each possible mutant of interest were created with Prosa. a total of 30 variants for each possible mutant of interest were created with Prosa. 7/ mice were infected with the parental strain 2009 pH1N1 (open circles) or received PBS only (gray circle) weight loss was monitored for 14 days. adapted pH1N1-MA7 strain was lethal for WT and 7/ mice. pH1N1-MA7 viruses are able to escape the requirement for importin-7 by acquiring adaptive mutations in the viral RNP and the surface glycoproteins. in order to identify the relevant viral genes responsible for the evasion of viral restriction in 7/ mice, we generated a single-gene reassortant virus containing one exchanged gene segment of the pH1N1-MA7 strain. adaptive mutations in HA and NA strongly enhanced pathogenicity, in contrast to adaptive mutations in the RNP. WT (black square) or 7/ (open square) mice were intranasally inoculated with recombinant viruses, i.e., 104 PFU of adapted pH1N1-MA7rec, 105 PFU of pH1N1-PAMA7, 105 PFU of pH1N1-NPMA7, 105 PFU a combination of both mutations in the RNP and in the glycoproteins is required to completely escape importin-7-mediated restriction in mice. we then generated structural models to investigate the localization of the pH1N1-MA7 adaptive mutations. all adaptive mutations are located on the surface of the viral proteins. to evaluate potential energy changes, we mimicked the adaptive mutations and compared the energies of the different mutants against their parental proteins. this suggests that these adaptive mutations do not alter the global stability of the protein. these mutations in PA, NP, HA, and NA do not directly affect protein conformation. h7 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing PB1, PA, NP, and PB2. plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase was omitted as a negative control. luciferase accumulation was determined at 20 h posttransfection. human HEK-WT cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged importins (1, 3, or 7) and NP or NPMA7. at 48 h posttransfection, importins were immunoprecipitated using the FLAG tag. coimmunoprecipitated NP was determined by Western blotting. human A549-WT and A549-sh7 cells infected with pH1N1-MA7 virus. adapted (pH1N1-MA7) viruses were infected at an MOI of 0.1 with parental (pH1N1) or adapted (pH1N1-MA7) viruses. mutations increased vRNA levels in WT and 7/ cells. vRNA accumulation was increased 220.7% in MEF-7/ cells. however, importin-7 dependency persisted with all recombinant viruses analyzed. importin-7 gene is crucial for replication and pathogenicity of human-type influenza viruses in mammals. lack of the importin-7 gene leads to 100% survival in mice infected with several 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus strains. 100% of mice succumb to infection (8). pH1N1-MA7 strain was more virulent for WT mice than its nonadapted parental strain. a group of 7/ mice were infected with the parental strain 2009 pH1N1 (open circles) or received PBS only (gray circle) weight loss was monitored for 14 days. reassortant virus containing one exchanged gene segment of the pH1N1-MA7 strain showed pathogenesis similar to that of the isolated clone. pH1N1-NPMA7 significantly enhanced weight loss in 7/ mice, which was further increased when combined with the PAMA7 gene segment. however, adaptive mutations in HA and NA strongly enhanced pathogenicity in 7/ mice. 105 PFU of adapted pH1N1-MA7rec, 105 PFU of pH1N1-PAMA7, 105 PFU of pH1N1-PA,NPMA7, 105 PFU of pH1N1-PA,NPMA7, 105 PFU of pH1N1-PA,NPMA7, and 105 PFU of pH1N1-NAMA7. weight loss and survival was monitored for 14 days. NPMA7 G102R and NAMA7 Y170H mutations are located in domains without a specific function described at the moment. adaptive mutations of pH1N1-MA7 with homologous structures are indicated in blue. local energy comparison shows no significant differences between the parental and the mutant structures. adaptive mutations in PA, NP, HA, and NA do not directly affect protein conformation, but they might affect interaction with other viral and/or host factors which affect protein functions. to study the effect of adaptive mutations in PA and NP genes on viral polymerase activity, we reconstituted viral RNPs in wild-type (HEK-WT) as well as in importin-7 knockdown (HEK-sh7) cells. luciferase accumulation was determined at 20 h posttransfection. the activity of the pH1N1 RNP in HEK-WT cells was set to 100%. NPMA7 shows a reduced binding affinity to importin-1, -3, and -7 isoforms. NP (black bars) or NPMA7 (dashed bars) binding to overexpressed importins was normalized against precipitated importin- levels. values of NP were normalized against precipitated importin- levels. relative amount of NP bound to importin-1 was set to 100%. importin-7 knockdown in human A549 cells was confirmed by Western blotting. compared to the pH1N1 parental strain, pH1N1-MA7 mutations remarkably enhanced virus replication in both cell lines. both parental pH1N1 and adapted pH1N1-MA7 viruses replicated better when importin-7 expression was not depleted. importin-7 dependency remains upon adaptation to 7/ mice. however, circumvention of importin-7 requirement seems to occur by an alternative pathway that results in increased replicative fitness. cellular proteins are less prone to mutations than viral proteins (3). importin-7 is crucial for human-type influenza virus replication. this is particularly attractive factor for transient inhibition to combat acute influenza virus infection. viral variants that escape antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir, were reported to be as virulent as, but not more virulent than the parental strain in mice. this finding calls for particular caution, since it shows that viral escape can easily occur and leads to the emergence of potentially more virulent strains. the PA-D27E mutation is located in the endonuclease domain but outside the active site. this mutation could indirectly influence its endonuclease activity. the NP-G102R mutant showed a generally reduced binding affinity to other importin- isoforms relevant for influenza virus replication. the NA-Y170H mutation is located in the inner part of the NA tetramer. this mutation could affect the assembly of NA into tetramers. the receptor binding site (RBS) of HA constitutes three main structural elements."}
