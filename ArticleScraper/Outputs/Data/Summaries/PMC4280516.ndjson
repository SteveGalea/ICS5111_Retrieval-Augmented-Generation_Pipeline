{"summary": "the majority of infections evolve to chronicity and liver disease starting from steatosis and fibrosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. the standard for therapy has been represented by pegylated interferon alpha plus ribavirin. the viral genome is translated into a polypeptide, which is sequentially processed into ten mature proteins. the structural proteins core and the envelope proteins (E1 and E2) lie at the N-terminus of the polyprotein. the non-structural proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B are located at the C-terminus. NS4A is a small hydrophobic protein that serves as a cofactor for NS3 serine protease. NS5B protein induces rearrangement of intracellular membranes assuring the framework for viral replication. over twenty-five years of research has revealed molecular mechanisms of the association between HCV and lipid metabolism. dietary triglyceride alters the density and dynamics of HCV in plasma of chronically infected patients. lipid composition of HCV virions indicates that more than half of the total HCV lipids are composed of cholesteryl esters. a single-stranded RNA genome, core and the envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2 contain classical viral components. the exact nature of the interactions involved between HCV virion components and the lipoprotein remains poorly understood. lipoproteins peripherally associate with canonical viral particles via interaction between apolipoproteins and the lipoproteins. HCV virion is associated with lipoproteins to form a complex particle called lipoviroparticle (LVP) it initiates its life cycle by binding to glycosaminoglycans. it initiates its life cycle by binding to glycosaminoglycans. lipoprotein component of viral particle interacts with the LDL receptor (LDL-R) and the virion is rapidly internalized and potentially sent to a degradation pathway. the virus is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and fusion takes place in early endosomes. a direct interaction between HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 and SRB1 lipoprotein receptor has first been shown in which hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of E2 plays an essential role. however, the role of SRB1 in HCV entry could be even more complex than previously thought. tetraspanin molecule CD81 appears to interact with the tetraspanin molecule. tetraspanin is highly dynamic at the cell surface and it is enriched in areas of the membrane that form stable platforms. the balance of these dynamic exchanges in the cell membrane is essential for HCV entry. the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) promotes CD81-CLDN1 complex formation by inducing CD81 diffusion through HRas activation. it facilitates CD81-CLDN1 co-internalization with HCV particles. the role of OCLN in the HCV life cycle remains poorly understood. recent structural data suggest that E1 should be the fusion protein or, at least, a fusion partner of an E1E2 fusion complex formed upon conformational rearrangements [86]. HCV replication occurs in association with rearranged intracellular membranes, which have been named \"membranous web\" replication-induced membrane rearrangements were shown to be more complex than initially thought. membrane alterations were shown to include numerous double membrane vesicles [92] that had not been observed before with replicons of genotype 1b. however, they were not observed in cells infected with other Flaviviridae family members. NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B are associated with modified membranes forming the \u201cmembranous web\u201d. NS4B protein induces the reorganization of intracellular membranes in partially closed double membrane structures where replication occurs. the host proteins PLA2G4C and PSTPIP2 influence this membrane remodeling. morphological and biochemical data led to the proposal that HCV replication complexes are derived from the ER membrane [88,89,91,94,102] however, several endosomal markers were reported as being colocalized with replication complexes. this indicates that the membranes of HCV replication complexes are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, two lipids underrepresented in the ER membrane. PI4KIII depletion leads to morphologically aberrant NS5A-positive structures in cells expressing the HCV polyprotein. this phenotype is mimicked by both NS5A and PI4KIII inhibitors. the kinase involved in enterovirus replication is PI4KIII, and not PI4KIII [120] OSBP interacts with VAP-A in the ER membrane, and to PI4P and Arf1 in the Golgi membrane. it uses an ER-Golgi gradient of PI4P produced by the Golgi-resident kinase PI4KIII and the ER-resident PI4P phosphatase Sac1 to back-transfer PI4P from the ER to the ER. these two glycosphingolipids were shown to be enriched in HCV replication complexes. addition to FAPP2-depleted cells could rescue HCV replication. some studies also suggest a critical role of the metabolism of fatty acids and phospholipids during HCV replication. poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are inhibitory. this inhibition was shown to result from PUFA peroxidation, which could be blocked by vitamin E. GBF1 is a brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive guanine nucleotide exchange factor of G-proteins of the Arf family. arfs recruit and activate effectors, which function in vesicular transport, phospholipid metabolism, non-vesicular lipid transport and actin cytoskeleton regulation. in support of additional GBF1 functions, we recently isolated a series of BFA-resistant cell lines derived from Huh-7 cells. a partially active secretory pathway in the presence of BFA does not support HCV replication, suggesting a distinct mechanism of action of GBF1 in the protein secretory pathway and in HCV replication. the membranous web was initially described in U-2 OS cells inducibly expressing the HCV polyprotein [88], indicating that its formation does not depend on the active replication of viral RNA. similar membrane alterations were later observed in Huh-7 cells harboring a subgenomic replicon of genotype 1b [89] and in JFH1-infected Huh-7 cells [90] the absence of membrane-associated ribosomes suggests that different types of membrane alteration observed in HCV-infected cells are not involved in translation of the genome. the replication complex gather NS3 protease and its co-factor NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. the presence of the three viral modules triggers the synchronous nucleocapsid assembly and envelopment potentiated by endogenous factors like PLA2G4A (6). the immature viral particle fuses or attaches to a luminal lipid droplet through apoE-E1E2 interaction. phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase-III (PI4KIII), also known as PI4KA, is involved in HCV replication. PI4KIII interacts with, and is activated by NS5A during HCV replication. PI4KIII activation leads to overexpression of PI4P in HCV-infected cells. PI4P produced in HCV-infected cells does not appear to generate PI(4,5)P2 or other phosphoinositides. PI4P appears to function as a beacon for recruiting host factors at replication complexes. two PI4P-interacting lipid transfer proteins have been reported to be involved in HCV replication. NS5A and PI4KIII inhibits HCV replication and generates morphologically aberrant NS5A-positive structures. similar PI4P-OSBP-cholesterol pathway controlled by PI4KIII is also used by poliovirus. expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism is modulated during HCV infection. fatty acid synthase is required for HCV replication and upregulated during HCV infection. other enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis have also been reported to be involved in HCV replication. sphingosine kinase-2-mediated lipid peroxidation of endogenous PUFAs induces a lipid peroxidation of endogenous PUFAs. this regulation by lipid peroxidation is proposed to participate in long-term persistence of the virus. the formation of membrane rearrangements is not inhibited by GBF1 inhibition [152,153,155], indicating that GBF1 is involved in the maturation or the activity of viral replication complexes. therefore, a GBF1-Arf1-COP-I pathway has been proposed to play a role in the replication of HCV [105,121,127,161] HCV Assembly HCV particle assembly assumes the spatial and temporal synchronization of the structural proteins and the replication complexes to result in the budding of an enveloped nucleocapsid. in the early stage, the viral modules involved in the process have to form and localize in the proximity of the assembly site. NS2 is a transmembrane protein localized in the ER with a critical role in viral replication and assembly. NS2 is a transmembrane protein localized in the ER with a critical role in viral replication and assembly. NS5A is the main assembly determinant of LDs. NS5A is a multifunctional protein composed of three domains: D1, D2 and D3 [178]. NS5A is involved in both replication and assembly through D1 [179] and D3 [180]. the hyperphosphorylation of NS5A is also dependent on the phosphorylation of a patch of serine residues. core association with LDs is a crucial step for the recruitment of other viral proteins to assembly sites. DGAT1 is involved in HCV assembly without affecting LD morphology. DGAT1 is a host factor with a role in direct recruitment of core to LD. NS5A is expressed without other non-structural proteins. it localizes both in the ER and abundantly around LDs. in the context of HCV subgenomic replicons, NS5A is located in puncta. NS5A hyperphosphorylation correlates with assembly step. the recruitment of NS5A along with the replication complexes to LD represents a major step in the debut of HCV particle assembly. the third event characterizing early assembly implies the arrival of the envelope proteins at the assembly site. the late stage of HCV assembly debuts with core, the NS2 complex and the replication complexes in close proximity of LD. PI4P and PI4P-binding protein GOLPH3 have a role in HCV secretion. hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is responsible for lipid metabolism and VLDL-mediated lipid transport. downregulation of HNF4 or its downstream target phospholipase A2 GXIIB also evidenced an impairment of HCV secretion. apoB is dispensable for HCV secretion, but apoE and MTP are not. apoE-HCV particle interaction in post-envelopment step. nascent particle matures further in post-ER step to get to low density of an infectious particle. NS2 is a transmembrane protein localized in the ER with a critical role in viral replication and assembly. NS2 is a transmembrane protein localized in the ER with a critical role in viral replication and assembly. NS5A is the main assembly determinant in the replication complex. NS5A is involved in both replication and assembly through D1 [179] and D3 [180]. the hyperphosphorylation of NS5A is deeply involved in HCV assembly. the current assembly picture assumes that the core protein attaches to LD through the D2 domain, dislocating the cellular ADRP in the process. this determines a change in both size and subcellular distribution of LD. core association with LDs is a crucial step for recruitment of other viral proteins to assembly sites. this step was reported to be modulated by different host factors. DGAT1 is involved in HCV assembly without affecting LD morphology, but DGAT2 has no effect on HCV assembly. NS5A is expressed without other non-structural proteins. it localizes both in the ER and abundantly around LDs. in the context of HCV subgenomic replicons, NS5A is located in puncta. NS5A hyperphosphorylation correlates with the assembly step. the recruitment of NS5A along with the replication complexes to LD represents a major step in the debut of HCV particle assembly. the third event characterizing early assembly implies the arrival of the envelope proteins at the assembly site. cellular proteins seem to play a central role during these processes. i-localized PI4P and the PI4P-binding protein GOLPH3 have a role in HCV secretion. the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is responsible for lipid metabolism and VLDL-mediated lipid transport. downregulation of HNF4 or its downstream target phospholipase A2 GXIIB also evidenced an impairment of HCV secretion. apoB is dispensable for HCV secretion, but apoE and MTP are not. the mere presence of apoE can lead to the production of infectious particles in non-hepatic cells, suggesting the crucial role of this protein in HCV infectivity. viral assembly is associated with LD, it strongly depends on apoE and the particle seems to follow a similar maturation pathway as VLDL. however, the assembly step of infectious HCV particles leaves a series of aspects not addressed. further studies of the interaction between HCV and lipid metabolism may also potentially help to better understand the role of some lipids in cell metabolism."}
