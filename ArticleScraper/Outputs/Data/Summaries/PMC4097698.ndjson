{"summary": "the first geographically disseminated biological warfare attack on american soil was launched and unwittingly disseminated by the postal service. a few clinical microbiology laboratories were testing clinical specimens from acutely ill patients and also being asked to test nasal swabs from the potentially exposed for both treatment prophylaxis and support of the concurrent epidemiological and criminal investigations. many clinical microbiology laboratories across the country received similar requests to test the worried well or evaluate potentially contaminated mail or environmental federal laboratories in the department of defense and the department of health and human services were surviving through mission-specific direct-line budget appropriations and research grants. in 1996, limited public health laboratory funding resulted from the Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) in 1999, a nascent public health Laboratory Response Network (LRN) received its first federal funding (5). a week in the life of the Laboratory Response Network (Florida) Date in 2001 Eventa Location Monday 1 October 73-year-old man hospitalized with a respiratory infection A Miami-Dade County hospital Tuesday 2 October 63-year-old man (index patient) hospitalized with symptoms of meningitis A commercial laboratory in Fort Lauderdale Wednesday 3 October Index patient isolate confirmed to be Bacillus anthracis. a nasal swab sample was collected 5 October 2001 from a patient hospitalized since 1 October. the 2nd case patient, who was a coworker of the index patient at American Media Inc., was tested. microbiology results confirmed that the isolate was B. anthracis Florida Bureau of Public Health Laboratories. first responders deploy and report rapid test positive for anthrax. 6,000 nasal and environmental swabs submitted for culture over the next 72 h U.S. Senate Hart Building. the clinical laboratory (level A sentinel) that received the initial specimen could not rule out B. anthracis and referred the isolate to the federal public health laboratory (level D definitive) for definitive characterization. an additional asymptomatic patient was identified by clinical sampling of the index patient's colleagues and contacts at the workplace intervention clinic supporting American Media Inc. activities were occurring regarding which clinical microbiologists were uniquely prepared to consult or participate. these activities included consultation on first-responder test kit use and interpretation, operation of therapeutic intervention clinics utilizing the Strategic National Stockpile, evidence collection and processing. these activities highlighted the essential role of the microbiology laboratory in supporting a public health and criminal investigation related to a bioterrorism event. the PHLs as part of the LRN have become an essential part of national laboratory preparedness. the LRN is also responsible for participating in the development and implementation of related legislation concerning select agents, biosecurity, and biosurety (16). since 2001, a number of laboratory-focused regulations have been legislated. laboratory personnel must obtain clearance through fingerprinting and background checks to work with select agents. biosafety procedures are defined as the discipline addressing the safe handling and containment of infectious microorganisms and hazardous biological materials to prevent unintentional exposure. laboratories must have appropriate practices, equipment, and infrastructure to protect biological pathogens and toxins from theft, loss or misuse. federally mandated consequences for sentinel laboratories if regulations are not carefully followed. federally mandated consequences if regulations are not carefully followed. federally mandated consequences if regulations not carefully followed.

(AMI), was tested. microbiology results confirmed that the isolate was B. anthracis Florida Bureau of Public Health Laboratories\u2014Miami a WBC, white blood cells; RBC, red blood cells. a hot-zone investigation was initiated to determine the extent of human exposure and environmental contamination. first responders deploy and report rapid test positive for anthrax. 6,000 nasal and environmental swabs submitted for culture over the next 72 h. the index case was identified in Florida on 4 October 2001. inel event for the nascent Laboratory Response Network (LRN) worked according to the organizational design. the clinical laboratory (level A sentinel) that received the initial specimen could not rule out B. anthracis. the state public health laboratory (level B or C confirmatory) forwarded the isolate to the federal public health laboratory (level D definitive) a number of unusual but similar activities were occurring regarding which clinical microbiologists were uniquely prepared to consult or participate. these activities included consultation on first-responder test kit use and interpretation, operation of therapeutic intervention clinics utilizing the Strategic National Stockpile, evidence collection and processing. these activities highlighted the essential role of the microbiology laboratory in supporting a public health and criminal investigation related to a bioterrorism event. since 1999, the PHLs as part of the LRN have become an essential part of national laboratory preparedness. the LRN is also responsible for participating in the development and implementation of related legislation concerning select agents, biosecurity, and biosurety. laboratory facilities that possess, use, or transport select agents must meet stringent documentation requirements for the SAP. tier 1 agents were designated and requirements imposed for laboratories possessing, shipping, or receiving such agents to enhance biosecurity barriers and biosurety procedures. laboratory personnel must obtain clearance through fingerprinting and background checks to work with select agents. checklist items for sentinel laboratories can be found at http://www.asm.org/index.php/guidelines/sentinel-guidelines. the select agent protocols can be found at http://www.asm.org/index.php/guidelines/sentinel-guidelines.

Criminal investigations. the FBI is rarely involved in processing of clinical specimens but in the event of a threat would coordinate with referral and sentinel laboratories. a good example of this was the influenza A virus H1N1 outbreak in 2009. the LRN/PHEP was able to provide surge capacity through public health laboratory support of increased testing demands. most clinical laboratories are rightly focused on improving technology for patient care while attempting to maintain sentinel laboratory compliance. a multicenter validation study is performed before each new assay is released. the CDC and the FBI have the final say for clinical laboratories that seek to provide definitive laboratory testing using CDC assays that are not FDA approved. additional challenges include biosurety, biosecurity, communications, and funding. dr. Bruce Ivins, a scientist and former employee at USAMRIID, acted alone in planning and executing the 2001 anthrax attacks. the NRCC report concluded that it was not possible to reach a definitive conclusion about the origins of the B. anthracis spores in letters mailed to New York City and Washington, DC. the report proposed other possible explanations for the similarities. the committee recommended that realistic expectations and limitations regarding the use of forensic science in such investigations need to be clearly communicated."}
