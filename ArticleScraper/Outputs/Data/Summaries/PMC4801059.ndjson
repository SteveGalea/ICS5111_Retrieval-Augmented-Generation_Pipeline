{"summary": "the burden is greatest in developing countries, at an estimated 0.22 episodes per child-year, but remains a major public health concern even among developed countries where there are an estimated 0.015 episodes per child-year. in the u.s., pneumonia is the second only to newborn infant births as the most common reason for hospital admissions. pneumonia cases without a detected pathogen underscore the limitations of current surveillance and detection methods. the large proportion of pneumonia cases without a detected pathogen underscores the limitations of current surveillance and detection methods and how they frame our understanding of pneumonia etiology. iology of pneumonia by altering bacterial carriage structure in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and (ii) respiratory viruses promote or inhibit colonization of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) by certain bacterial species residing in the URT. the human respiratory tract can be defined as an ecosystem with two distinct niches: the URT, characterized by regular asymptomatic carriage of commensal bacteria, and the LRT, which is inhabited at a low abundance by bacteria in healthy individuals. microbial selection in the URT may play an important role in etiology as bacterial strains in the URT can be readily aspirated into the LRT. nasopharynx Organism 1 Organism 2 Interactiona Potential mechanismsb S. pneumoniae S. aureus Antagonism [19, 20, 24\u201327, 29\u201332] Hydrogen peroxide production [107] Catalase [108] Pilus [109] Immune-mediated competition [110, 111] S. pneumoniae H. influenzae Synergism [18\u201327, 112] Provision of nutrients [15] Production of -lactamase [113 in the LRT microbiome studies suggest that bacteria colonizing the LRT overlap with those found in the URT. however, the abundance of organisms is quite low and their role in pneumonia etiology has yet to be explored. 50% of children 2 years in the u.s. frequently causes URT infections, such as acute otitis media. however, unlike S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis rarely causes pneumonia [46], suggesting differences in mechanisms of pathogenicity may be the explanation. in developed countries, the risk of pneumonia is highest in individuals 65 years or over. adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other viruses have been temporally associated with an increased risk of pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other viruses have been associated with an increased risk of pneumococcal pneumonia. one found an association only among children [68], the last observed an association only in individuals 2 years or older [69]. Temporal associations provide evidence of virus\u2013bacterial interactions, but do not necessarily prove these interactions exist. many viral infections are seasonal, as is pneumonia infection. in the u.s., 47% of children and 19% of adults with bacterial pneumonia are co-infected with one or more viruses. vaccine for S. pneumoniae reduced pneumonia associated with RSV, influenza A and parainfluenza (PIV types 1-3) of 20 respiratory viruses and the main commensal bacteria in the nasopharynx of 433 healthy Dutch children aged 6\u201324 months. rhinovirus was positively associated with S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, coronaviruses and adenovirus were positively associated with M. catarrhalis. influenza virus was positively associated with S. aureus. infection with influenza A virus showed increased colonization by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in the URT [79\u201383]. epidemiologic studies suggest the introduction of a virus to the URT niche can substantially alter the bacterial community present [26] a link between viral co-infection, carriage and pneumonia for S. pneumoniae needs further exploration. studies that can directly test whether viral infection led to bacterial colonization or overgrowth by a potential pathogen, are in order. there is no definitive answer to our first hypothesis. sion IAV S. pneumoniae [88, 89] Increased expression of cell surface receptors ADV S. pneumoniae [121] PIV H. influenzae [100, 123] RSV S. pneumoniae [100, 123] S. pneumoniae [100, 123] Direct binding of virus and bacteria RSV S. pneumoniae [124, 125] Damaged and inhibited repair of respiratory epithelium cells IAV S. aureus [26] S. pneumoniae [75 in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest free sialic acid released by viral neuraminidase can behave as signaling molecules promoting pneumococcal biofilm formation, nasopharyngeal colonization and bacterial spread to the lungs. viruses can promote bacterial adhesion by upregulating receptors for pathogenic bacteria. despite literature on potential mechanisms of viral\u2013bacterial interactions, most studies are limited to experiments conducted in animal models. the interactions between virus and bacteria are undoubtedly far more complex than identified in animal models. we hypothesized that viruses influence bacterial selection in the LRT leading to colonization of the LRT and sometimes pneumonia. in vitro and in vivo studies suggest viruses can promote entry and colonization of the LRT for select bacterial species via a range of biological mechanisms including URT biofilm dispersion. authors report no potential conflicts of interest."}
