{"summary": "chicken anaemia virus (CAV), a member of family anelloviridae genus Gyrovirus, is the etiological agent of chicken infectious anaemia. the virus infects several bone marrow-derived cells which results in severe anaemia and immunosuppression in young chickens. in terms of older birds, CAV can jeopardize the immune responses. VP3, also called apoptin, is also a non-structural protein that mainly implicats in the induction of apoptosis and viral cytotoxicity in host cells. in 1996, CAV was first reported from young broilers in china [13]. a high prevalence of 87% resulted in studies of the virus on live bird markets in Southeast China [15]. 722 clinical specimens from suspected sick fowl or fowl embryos were collected from 2014 to 2015. samples included livers, spleens, and thymuses. the samples were not only collected from clinical dead chickens, but also from suspected sick ones. aplification was carried out using premix ex Taq (Version 2.0 plus dye, TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China), MgCl2, dNTPs, and 10 pmol each primer in a 20-L total reaction volume. the reactions ran in an automated thermal cycler (Gene Amp PCR System TC-960F; Blue Marlin, Switzerland) after three washes with PBST, cells were incubated for 1 h with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody in the dark. cells with positive PCR results were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS (pH = 7.4), and lysed with lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 blotting membranes were incubated with primary antibody at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. the membranes were incubated with the IRDye 800CW secondary antibody for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. proteins were visualised using the Odyssey system (Li-Cor, USA) the two regions were purified using the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction kit. DNA extraction and PCR were performed at least twice for each sample. specific PCR products of \u201cVP1\u201d and \u201cInVP1\u201d regions were subcloned into the pMD18-T Easy vector. mini-preparation of plasmid DNAs was performed with a plasmid extraction kit. plasmid DNAs were sequenced by Comate Bioscience Co., Ltd. (Changchun, Jilin, China) complete VP1 were cloned into pCAGGS (reserved by our laboratory) AV strains were named using the format PPYYXXX, where PP was the location of sampling, and YYXXX was the time and order of the sample origin. Relevant whole genome and coding sequence (CDS) available in GenBank were included for comparison. the new CAV strains were named using the format PPYYXXX. the strains were named using the format PPYYXXX. PP was the location of sampling, and YYXXX was the time and order of the sample origin. the animal experiments were performed in strict compliance with the guideline for the care and use of laboratory animals of the People\u2019s Republic of China. total DNA was extracted from the tissue homogenates using the AxyPrep Body Fluid Viral DNA/RNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen, 15916KC5, USA), following the manufacturer instructions. the DNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water and stored at 70\u00b0C. IFA IFA was performed using MDCC-MSB1 cells (preserved by our lab) to detect CAV antigens. cells were smeared onto 35-mm culture dishes with 20-mm cover glass inserts. cells were dried, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. whole lysates were boiled for 10 min in presence of 5 sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading buffer. equivalent sample amounts were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. membranes were incubated with primary antibody at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. initial denaturation of 98\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 15 s, extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. PCR products were analysed by 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and imaged using the BIO-RAD Universal Hood II system. regions were subcloned into the pMD18-T Easy vector (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China), and the ligated products were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5 competent cells. plasmid DNAs were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted into pCAGGS. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using the neighbour-joining method [26], the Kimura 2-parameter model [27], pairwise deletion, and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. the new CAV strains were named using the format PPYYXXX, where PP was the location of sampling. 6155 16 01\u20134201 USA 2007 DQ991394 17 3\u20131 Malaysia 2003 AF390038 18 3\u20131 P60 Malaysia 2003 AY040632 19 10 United Kingdom 1997 U66304 20 98D02152 USA 2016 AF311892 21 98D06073 USA 2016 AF311900 22 704 Australia 1996 U65414 23 AH4 Anhui, China 2005 DQ124936 24 AH6 Anhui, China 2005 DQ124935 25 BD the new CAV strains were named using the format PPYYXXX, where PP was the location of sampling. results CAV was prevalent in poultry in coinfection type We obtained 96 CAV-positive samples out of 722 clinical samples. positive samples Percentage of total samples Single infection CAV 32 41.67% 5.58% Dual infection CAV+MDV 18 25.00% 3.14% CAV+REV 3 4.17% 0.52% CAV+AGV2 1 1.39% 0.17% Subtotal 23 31.94% 4.01% Triple infection CAV+REV+MDV 10 13.89% 1.75% CAV+AGV2+MDV 3 4.17% 0.52% CAV+ARV+MDV 2 2.78% Fig 1. Detection, isolation, and identification of chicken anaemia virus (CAV) from clinical samples. M, Marker (DNA ladder 2000); N, negative control; P, positive control; Lane 2, 6, 12, 13, and 14 were CAV-positives. the obtained sequences had a high level of nucleotide similarity with each other. the divergence is only 1.0% (JS15165 and JS15166) to 2.5% (HLJ1508 and JL15120) all the sequences in this study belonged mainly to Subgroup A1 (14/15, 93.33%), indicating that the main CAV prevalent isolates possessed the typical Asian virus characteristics in whole genome sequence. strain HLJ15108 (1/15, 6.67%) which belonged to Subgroup A6 with a unique mutation. twenty-three substitutions were detected in VP2 (amino acid sites 5, 6, 28, 35, 43, 46, 60, 70, 74, 77, 116, 126, 143, 153, 160, 163, 167, 177, 180, 186, 187, 201, and 209) with a mutation probability of 10.65%. nine amino acids sites in VP1 had at least three substitutions each. four major groups were present in the VP1 protein sequence phylogenetic tree. phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of 15 new viral protein 1 (VP1) sequences and 46 VP1 sequences available in GenBank. at amino acid sites 89, 141, and 394, all CAV isolates presented threonine (T) instead of alanine (A), typical of low virulent strains. at amino acid sites 125, 139, and 144, fourteen isolates presented valine (V), except HLJ1508 that presented isoleucine (L), lysine (K), and glutamic acid (E), respectively, as low virulent strains. the single infection of CAV was detected in 32 (41.67%) samples; the remaining samples (58.33%) indicated mixed infection. the 23 dual infections included CAV and following co-infecting virus. the 15 triple infections included CAV and REV + MDV (n = 10), AGV2 + MDV (n = 3), and ARV + MDV (n = 2). Mixed infection with MDV was most common infection type (87.5%) of coinfection samples. compared to the non-infected cells and the eukaryotic transfection of truncated VP1, three main bands were observed. one 52-kDa band (50-kDa of the truncated) was observed as expected. two additional bands (38-kDa and 36-kDa band) were also detected. the 15 new CAV genomes had a length of 2,298 nucleotides, containing only four 21-nucleotide direct repeat regions in the 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) all the sequences had high levels of nucleotide similarity with each other, the divergence is only 1.0% (JS15165 and JS15166) to 2.5% (HLJ1508 and JL15120). CIA-1, two european sequences, and three Chinese sequences belonged to Subgroup A6. group B comprised only one sequence (82\u20132 (D31965). group C comprised two Chinese strains (SD22 (DQ141673). twenty-three substitutions were detected in VP2 (amino acid sites 5, 6, 28, 35, 43, 46, 60, 70, 74, 77, 116, 126, 143, 153, 160, 163, 167, 177, 180, 186, 187, 201, and 448) nine amino acids sites in VP1 had at least three substitutions each, while there was only one amino acid site (28) in VP2. four major groups were present in the VP1 protein sequence phylogenetic tree. phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of 15 new viral protein 1 (VP1) sequences and other 46 VP1 sequences available in GenBank. the percentages of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1,000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. the critical amino acid substitution in CAV VP1 At the amino acid level, the new CAV strains showed virulent characteristics. the key amino acids of VP1 determines the virulence of CAV. a high positive rate of CAV was detected in sick chickens. a high positive rate of CAV was detected in sick chickens. reovirus can be immunosuppressive in chickens [37], which demonstrates the reovirus has strong link to the pathogenicity of CAV [37] VP1, the only structural protein in CAV encodes the viral capsid, encodes the viral capsid, whose predicted mass is 50 kDa [38]. some sites induced caspase-dependent cleavage to benefit viral replication. some sites induced caspase-dependent cleavage to benefit viral replication. some sites induced caspase-dependent cleavage to benefit viral replication. all the new isolates in this study had glutamine (Q) at amino acid site 394, indicating that all strains were highly pathogenic. the attribution to the VP1 amino acid is due to the pathogenicity and monoclonal antibody reactivity differences. using high quality chicks and embryos (CAV-free) in the vaccines production process will be a good option. it is necessary to eliminate and replace the CAV positive chickens. sequences from GenBank are named by the country name followed by the accession number."}
