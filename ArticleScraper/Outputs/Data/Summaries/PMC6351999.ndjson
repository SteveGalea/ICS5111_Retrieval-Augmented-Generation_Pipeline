{"summary": "YF was suspected and confirmed by a real-time PCR diagnostic assay on samples collected on 19 November. the patient was discharged 3 weeks after admission and has fully recovered from the infection. a complete YFV genome (10771 nt) was obtained from the analysis. all available YFV genomes retrieved from GenBank (n=188) were aligned using MUSCLE [5], manually checked in AliView [6], and trimmed to the complete Open Reading Frame (ORF). a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using the sequence alignment in RAxML [8] under the GTR + 4 model of evolution. the reported YFV genome is indicated in red; the YFV vaccine strain is indicated in turquoise and the YFV strain from angola outbreak is indicated in blue. the phylogeny was mid-point rooted for clarity and only bootstrap values for major clades were shown. discussion and conclusion YF is a severe, mosquito-borne flavivirus infection caused by YFV. there have been several reports of YF cases in unvaccinated travellers returning from endemic regions in the past years. a key component of a successful elimination campaign is the ability to detect new cases and to understand the ecology of YF in regions at risk for cases from enzootic circulation or new introductions. YFV genomic sequence reported here is available on GenBank with the accession number MK292067."}
