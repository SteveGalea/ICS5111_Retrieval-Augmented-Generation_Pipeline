{"summary": "Morbilliviruses belong to the order Mononegavirales, family Paramyxoviridae, and include measles virus (MeV), rinderpest virus (RPV), and canine distemper virus (CDV) rinderpest became the second viral disease, after smallpox, to be eradicated. vaccination has contributed to reducing the mortality rate in infants. deaths due to measles were reduced by 78% worldwide between 2000 and 2008. the virus uses this protein to attach to cell receptors during first step of infection. administration of the live attenuated vaccine results in transient immunosuppression, but induces both expression of the neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses sufficient for protection. the original Edmonston B vaccine was licensed in 1963 (Griffin, 2007) the most important function of CD46 is as an inhibitor of complement activation. it protects host cells from complement deposition by functioning as a cofactor for factor-I-mediated proteolytic inactivation of C3b and C4b. in addition, CD46 has been implicated in modulation of T-cell functions. CD46-mediated immunosuppression in MeV infection has been reported. one mechanism involves inhibiting activation-induced expression of interleukin (IL)-12, which is essential for the generation of successful effector T-cell responses. interleukin binding to CD46 also induces IL-10. strains of MeV do not induce typical symptoms in non-human primate species. rhesus and cynomolgus macaques have been described to cause outbreaks of measles in colonies. but laboratory strains of MeV do not induce disease in these animals. strains isolated in B95a cells or human B-cell lines were shown to grow only in a limited number of lymphoid cell lines. the H protein of MeV isolated from B-cell lines neither induced downregulation of CD46 nor caused cell\u2013cell fusion in CD46-positive cell lines. the sequence of the clone was a homolog of signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM), and consequently, human SLAM was identified as a lymphoid cell receptor for wild-type MeV. SLAM acts as a receptor not only for B-cell line-isolated MeV strains but also for vaccine and laboratory-adapted strains. SLAM is implicated in regulation of T-cell activation by affecting T-cell antigen receptor signaling. SLAM has the ability to regulate the functions of several other immune cell types. mutagenesis of the H protein based on its ability to induce SLAM-dependent cell\u2013cell fusion has also been linked. residues important for interaction with SLAM are I194, D505, D507, Y529, D530, T531, R533, H536, Y553, and P554. the SLAM extracellular domain is composed of a variable (V) and a constant (C2) Ig-like repeat. SLAM interacts with another SLAM on an adjacent cell. meV entered the host at the alveolar level by infecting macrophages or dendritic cells. recombinant viruses possessing H are incapable of recognizing SLAM but can enter epithelial cells (SLAM-blind) the virus is completely avirulent in ferrets; infection caused only a small, short-lived decrease in the blood leukocyte count. the SLAM-blind RPV in rabbits could infect epithelial but not lymphoid cells. this suggests that SLAM-mediated cell entry is crucial for expression of full pathogenicity of morbillivirus. in vitro studies have shown that a number of SLAM-negative cell types of epithelial or neuronal origin result in cytopathic effects. polarized epithelial cells possess a putative epithelial receptor, EpR. the receptor appears to be expressed on the basolateral side of the cells that is associated with tight junctions. an EpR-blind MeV maintaining SLAM-dependent cell entry was generated and inoculated intranasally into monkeys. only human PVRL4 (nectin-4), a tumor cell marker found on breast, lung, and ovarian carcinomas, rendered cells susceptible to MeV infection. antibodies specific for human nectin-4 inhibited MeV infection. details of the interaction mechanism of the newly identified receptor, nectin-4, with MeV-H have not been elucidated. it is unclear whether nectin-4 produces intracellular signals upon engagement with MeV-H. further studies are necessary to clarify the implications of the interaction of MeV-H and nectin-4 in MeV pathogenicity. meV-infected immune cells transmit MeV to epithelial cells from the basolateral side. progeny viruses are released from the host as respiratory aerosols. morbillivirus is also detected in endothelial and neuronal cells. meV binds to cellular CD147, a receptor for CypA and B. it is known that CypA incorporated into HIV-1 particles translocates to the surfaces of virions. this finding is the first among viruses belonging to the order Mononegavirales. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
