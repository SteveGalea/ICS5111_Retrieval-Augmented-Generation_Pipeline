{"summary": "avian influenza outbreaks in downwind areas of Asian dust storms suggest that viruses might be transported by dust storms. results We successfully quantified ambient influenza virus using the filtration/real-time qPCR method during ADS days and background days. air samples were monitored during the ADS season (1 January to 31 May) in 2006 at two air monitoring stations run by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA) the wan-Li station is located in a remote area near the northern tip of Taiwan. results confirmed no detectable influenza virus RNA in either trip blanks or field blank controls. the Shin-Jhuang station is located in Shin-Jhuang City, an important business and industrial center in Taipei County. significant ADS episodes originating in the deserts of Mongolia and western China were detected as yellow dust at ground observation stations in China. satellite images provided by the MODIS onboard the Terra or Aqua satellite were also used to track the ADS paths in East Asia. grangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model (http://www.arl.noaa.gov/hysplit-bin/trajtype.pl)runtype=archive) wind trajectories on both episode days and background days were confirmed using HYSPLIT back-trajectories. in our study, samples were first analyzed for influenza A virus. only those positive samples were then analyzed for A/H5. 103 to 104 colonyforming units (CFU) per cubic meter bacterial and fungal bioaerosols inhibited PCR amplification. positive samples were those in which cDNA was quantified in any diluted solution. the chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to evaluate the differences in positive rates and inhibitory rates between ADS days and background days. we used the Spearman correlation to evaluate relations between ambient influenza virus and environmental factors. results confirmed no detectable influenza virus RNA in either trip blanks or field blank controls. side-by-side duplicate field samples yield comparable results. air samples were monitored during the ADS season (1 January to 31 May) in 2006 at two air monitoring stations. influenza virus was analyzed on days reported as ADS days according to TEPA. air quality trends measured by three types of air monitoring stations in northern Taiwan were used to define beginning and end of each ADS episode in Taipei. the commercially available QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was used to isolate RNA. the procedure followed manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. the sampled Teflon filter was folded into quadrants with virus inside. the viral RNA was stored at 80\u00b0C until analysis within 1 month. 5\u2032-TCAACAGTGGCGAGTTCCCTAGCA Amplification and detection were performed using a TaqMan One-step Reverse Transcriptase PCR Master Mix Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems) with 5 L viral RNA solution in an end volume of 25 L. all samples analyzed using the real-time qPCR were done in triplicate. we defined the inhibitory rate as the number of inhibitory samples divided by the number of positive samples. environmental parameters subjected to statistical analysis included concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter 10 m (PM10; micrograms per cubic meter), PM with aerodynamic diameter 2.5 m (PM2.5; micrograms per cubic meter), nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide (NOx; micrograms per cubic meter), ozone (O3; parts per billion), sulfur dioxide ( samples collected for 24 hr using an MFC-PM10 sampler and a PTFE cassette. sample type PTFE cassette High-volume sampler p-Valuea Spiked samples (copies/m3) 701.9 309.6 433.1 128.4 0.076 Unspiked samples (copies/m3) 76.4 22.09 5.9 8.7 0.606 Inhibitory rate 43% 80% a Mann-Whitney U-test. for influenza A virus, both the positive rate (the number of positive samples divided by the number of all samples) and mean concentration were higher during ADS days than during background days. inhibitory rates for influenza A virus were higher during ADS days than during background days. HYSPLIT back-trajectories indicated that the trajectories of all positive samples collected during ADS periods were from mainland China. those collected during background days were not. HYSPLIT back-trajectories of air masses arriving at the Wan-Li air monitoring station in Taiwan during the ADS period (A) and background days (B) Plots show 3-day air mass back-trajectories on 8 February 2006 (A) and 11 January 2006 (B) negative samples from wan-Li and Shin-Jhuang stations were significantly negatively correlated with PM10 and PM2.5 on background days. mean PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were also significantly lower among negative samples. the average concentrations of influenza virus measured from both spiked and unspiked samples were higher when sampled with the PTFE cassette. the overall inhibitory rate was higher for the high-volume sampler than for the PTFE cassette. sampler (mean SD) Sample type PTFE cassette High-volume sampler p-Valuea Spiked samples (copies/m3) 701.9 309.6 433.1 128.4 0.076 Unspiked samples (copies/m3) 76.4 22.09 5.9 8.7 0.606 Inhibitory rate 43% 80% a Mann-Whitney U-test. 1.8 ND Median (copies/m3) 0 ND Range (copies/m3) Influenza A Positive rate (%) 46 (11/24) 20 (2/10) 0.25 Mean (copies/m3) 276 9 0.11 Median (copies/m3) 89 9 Range (copies/m3) 4\u20131,160 5\u201313 Inhibitory rate (%) 72.7 (8/11) 0 (0/2) A/H5 Positive rate (%) 0 (0/24) 0 (0/10) Mean ( p-Valuea Mean Median Range Mean Median Range Wan-Li station PM10 (g/m3) 47.71 45.40 0.0 100 to 1.5 102 32.13 29.15 7.7 100 to 6.5 101 0.041 PM2.5 (g/m3) 31.50 32.21 7.0 100 to 7.2 101 18.91 14.18 3.5 100 to 3.4 101 0.005 CO (ppmm) 0.35 0.35 2.0 101 to 5.2 101 0.25 0.25 9.0 HYSPLIT back-trajectories of air masses arriving at the Wan-Li air monitoring station in Taiwan during the ADS period (A) and background days (B) Plots show 3-day air mass back-trajectories on 8 February 2006 (A) and 11 January 2006 (B) mean PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were significantly lower among samples positive for influenza A virus (22.86 g/m3 and 10.85 g/m3) than among negative samples (46.88 g/m3 and 26.94 g/m3; p-values for the difference in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations of 0.010 and 0.013, respectively) study successfully quantified ambient influenza virus using filtration/real-time qPCR. this is the first report describing concentrations of influenza virus in ambient air. airborne viruses were detected using filtration coupled with a PCR-based method. a high-volume sampler would increase the total amount of virus collected in a given sample, enhancing detection sensitivity. the face velocity of the high-volume sampler is actually lower than that of the PTFE cassette (0.3 m/sec) qPCR for influenza A and A/H5 virus were 0.8 copy/m3 and 1.23 copies/m3 respectively. the lowest concentrations measured in positive samples were 1 copy/m3 and 2 copies/m3 for influenza A and A/H5 virus, respectively. human influenza virus could occur in the winter months due to low dose of virus required for infection. previous studies report a relationship between particle association/attachment and enhanced survival. this suggests that the attachment of infectious viruses to dust particles moving across the ocean might enhance long-range host-to-host transport. temperature was significantly lower during episode days than during background days. no significant correlations between ambient influenza virus concentration and air pollutants. similar composition of air pollutants during the ADS period might be the reason. the concentration of ambient influenza A virus was significantly higher during ADS days than during background days."}
