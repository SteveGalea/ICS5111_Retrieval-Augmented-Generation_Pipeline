{"summary": "a new coronavirus was identified as the suspected causative agent of an increased number of atypical pneumonia cases reported from Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and Canada. a total of 8,422 patients were affected during the first 6 months of 2003. this fact, together with the reappearance of the SARS-associated coronavirus in late 2003, makes it clear that rapid and reliable diagnostic tools are essential for accurate disease reporting and subsequent disease management. 98.8%\u201399.4% of the 3,768 bases of S gene, 99% of 658 bases of M gene, and 99% of 1,068 bases of N gene are isogenous with those submitted to public databases. however, even these minimal changes could render existing PCR assays ineffective. gTAgTgTCAgTATCATCACC S 4609\u20134631 56.6 pp1a TM F-TCACTTCgTCATCAAAgACATC XT gAggAgC p S 4661\u20134690 66.2 NS pp1ab (88 bp)d NS F TTTTgTTgTTTCAACTggATACCAT S 14387\u2013411 57.0 NS R GAAACTgAgCTATg the real-time RT-PCR assays were successfully run on the Applied Biosystems real-time PCR systems (SDS7700 and SDS7000; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) all assays were designed as one-step RT-PCR reactions to be run under identical conditions on the respective PCR platform. cycling conditions were 30 min at 50\u00b0C for RT reaction, 15 min at 95\u00b0C for inactivation of RT, activation of the Taq DNA polymerase, and cDNA denaturation. total running time was 140 min for each 20-L reaction. ral RNA Kit (Qiagen) from cultured SARS-CoV with defined amounts of genome equivalents (GE) Detection limits of the three new assays were 10 GE. the new assays were at least as sensitive as the previously described assays (5,8) and the commercially available kit. five hundred genome equivalents (GE) of SARS-CoV were amplified with the three single assays-NS pp1a, NS pp1ab, n.d., not determined. agarose gel analysis of the amplification products in a 3% gel is shown. no fluorescence signal was observed for control pathogens. all samples were positive for L13 and cyclophilin control sequences. between 20 and 1,000 GE/mL of SARS-CoV-specific RNA was detected in 21 of 35 serum samples. none of the assays displayed cross-reactivity to clinical samples containing human cDNA from blood; human CoV 229E; influenza viruses A and B; parainfluenzaviruses 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus; rhinoviruses; enteroviruses 1\u201310; human metapneumovirus; Mycoplasma pneumonia amplification of two human reference genes, L13 and cyclophilin, confirmed negative results in clinical samples by demonstrating amplifiable RNA. the separation of the control reaction was chosen to guarantee the high sensitivity of the SARS-CoV detection of 10 GE of SARS-CoV per reaction."}
