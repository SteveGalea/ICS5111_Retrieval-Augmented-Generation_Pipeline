{"summary": "avian infectious coronavirus, calf diarrhea, winter dysentery, respiratory infections (BRD-BCoV) in cattle, SDCV, PEDV, SECD in swine and dog, intestinal disease or Feline Infectious Peritonitis (Saif, 2014), and the human mild and common cold. emergence of these two events shed light on the threat posed by coronaviruses to humans. 56 species of bats are hunted and consumed by low-income populations. they are also used in traditional medicine and on farms for the production of guano. biological problem of viral emergence has not fundamentally changed. probability of occurrence of the risk is increasing owing to environmental change. anthropized rural environments are characterized by a wide variety of landscapes. houses, barns, fields, orchards, and woods of differing density. common belief is that deforestation and anthropization will lead to the disappearance of species. this increases the risk of transmission of viruses through direct contact, domestic animal infection, or contamination by urine or feces. the risk of emergence of disease is as much on domestic animal diseases as on human diseases. the emergence of a disease is impossible to predict. it is an accidental process, i.e., the occurrence of an extremely low probability event. the increased probability of encounter and occurrence of an emergence-leading chain of events yielded by anthropized environments must be considered seriously. 2% of the bats sampled in three bat farms carried CoV, which is a high level of animal contamination. HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 were reported as endemic and responsible for mild to moderate respiratory tract diseases. HCoV-NL63, found in 9.3% of samples from people hospitalized for respiratory diseases displays sequence similarities with the bat. 83.2% of transmission events were epidemiologically linked to five \"superspreaders\" the problem of bat-borne viruses is not restricted to CoVs. 59 are RNA viruses which might possibly be responsible for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in humans. the main risk for emergence of diseases is directly linked to the development of anthropized environments. lyssaviruses like ABLV, Lago virus or Duvenhage virus are examples of bat-borne viruses directly transmitted to humans by bats. these events of direct transmission remain rare but stress the risk associated with a higher biodiversity of bats and a higher density of bat populations in close proximity to humans. s between bat CoVs, domestic animals and humans poses a significant threat for the future. it is necessary to increase CoV surveillance in wildlife, cattle, pets and humans. it will certainly be crucial to pay special attention to \"superspreaders\" who are very efficient at transmitting CoVs through exposure to respiratory droplets."}
