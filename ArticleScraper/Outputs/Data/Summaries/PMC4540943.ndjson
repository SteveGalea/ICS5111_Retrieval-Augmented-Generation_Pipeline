{"summary": "in most cases, infections have directly or indirectly been traced to the Arabian Peninsula. at least 1,082 human cases are known, including 439 fatalities. clinical symptoms include fever, diarrhea, and mild to severe respiratory symptoms. patients under study were diagnosed with MERS between February and June 2014. patients were part of a larger observational, single-center trial. 51 samples from 32 patients were subjected to virus isolation. cell culture supernatant was taken to monitor the increase of MERS-CoV RNA by real-time RT-PCR using the MERS-CoV upE assay. the supernatant of isolation-positive wells was harvested, centrifuged at 200 g for 3 min to remove cell debris, diluted 1:2 in OptiPro (Gibco) containing 0.5% gelatin for storage. diluted in 2 DMEM supplemented with 2% sodium pyruvate, 2% nonessential amino acids, 2% l-glutamine, 2% penicillin-streptomycin, and 20% FCS. three days after infection, cells were fixed in 6% formaldehyde. 100 l of a virus solution containing 60 to 80 PFU was incubated with 100 l diluted patient serum for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. patients were part of a larger observational, single-center trial. 51 samples from 32 patients were subjected to virus isolation. a total of 51 samples from 32 patients were subjected to virus isolation. 50 l of cell culture supernatant was taken to monitor the increase of MERS-CoV RNA by real-time RT-PCR using the MERS-CoV upE assay. the supernatant of isolation-positive wells was harvested, centrifuged at 200 g for 3 min to remove cell debris, diluted 1:2 in OptiPro (Gibco) containing 0.5% gelatin for storage. three days after infection, cells were fixed in 6% formaldehyde and stained with a solution containing 0.2% crystal violet, 2% ethanol, and 10% formaldehyde. 100 l of a virus solution containing 60 to 80 PFU was incubated with 100 l diluted patient serum for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. yadh regional laboratory using upE and ORF1A assays. a total of 21 MERS-CoV isolates were obtained from 32 different patients. no virus could be isolated from any of the 4 upper respiratory tract samples. isolation success for 47 lower respiratory tract samples was 48.6%. four of 4 isolates from sputa and 16 of 17 isolates from endotracheal aspirates were grown in Caco cells. only 1 isolate from sputa and 8 isolates from endotracheal aspirates grew in vero B4 cells. the general levels of IgA and IgG were substantially lower in samples yielding an isolate than those of samples from which isolation failed. the amino acid variability within the viral spike protein is extremely low between MERS-CoV strains (4). the patient from which MERS-CoV Najran-351 was isolated provided a reference for virus neutralization by a homologous serum. initial diagnostic tests were done by RT-PCR at Riyadh regional laboratory using upE and ORF1A assays as described previously (10). a total of 21 MERS-CoV isolates were obtained from 32 different patients. only 9 of the 21 MERS-CoV isolates were obtained on vero B4 cells. there was only one isolate that grew exclusively in vero B4 cells. the proportion of successful isolates was significantly superior in Caco-2 cells over vero cells. recombinant ELISA determined the reduced isolation success in later stages of the infection. the general levels of IgA and IgG were substantially lower in samples yielding an isolate than those of samples from which isolation failed. there may be other factors that determine the virus's immunogenicity. DISCUSSION We have conducted the first study of MERS-CoV infection based on virus isolation. we provide information on infectious doses in patient material as well as serotype variability of human MERS-CoV strains. IgA secretion is quantitatively correlated with IgG production in serum. the presence of IgA antibodies in respiratory secretions has an influence on infection rates and virus-associated illness. the presence of mucosal IgA antibodies in respiratory secretions has an influence on infection rates. circulating in the human population form only one serotype."}
