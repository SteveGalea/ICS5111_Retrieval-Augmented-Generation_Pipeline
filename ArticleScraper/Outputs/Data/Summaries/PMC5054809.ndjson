{"summary": "a good quality specimen from the site of the infection is not readily available 1\u20134. access to such a specimen would be an important advance in the monitoring and treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) and other lower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, asthma, lung cancer, etc. the device uses a reservoir to separate oral contents from lung aerosols. the first volume of air that comes from exhalation or coughing is contaminated air from the upper respiratory tract, also known as anatomic dead space. this air flows to the reservoir first as it has the least resistance compared to the filter at the end of the device. patients with CF (n=20) aged >18 years old were recruited from the Emory Cystic Fibrosis Center Adult Clinic in Atlanta, Georgia. the goal of this study is to determine if the cough device can capture lung pathogens from adult patients while simultaneously excluding oral bacteria. the cough device used in this study provides a less cumbersome option. each patient coughed 10 times into the device to ensure sufficient aerosol collection. microbiology microbiology culturing has several limitations. the extracted nucleic acid was eluted into 100 L of elution buffer and stored at -80\u00b0C for qPCR testing. the sputum specimen was mixed with 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), homogenized with pipetting and vortexing. the resultant solution was divided into 400 L aliquots and stored at -80\u00b0C. all specimens from CF patients were run in duplicate for each target. the C T values for individual PCR assays were used as an indication of the relative quantity of bacteria in the specimen. ella pneumoniae are cystic fibrosis related bacteria (CFRB) 18\u201320. determining sufficient aerosol collection Fennelly\u2019s Cough Aerosol Sampling System (CASS) 29, 30 and Knibbs\u2019 Distance Rig 13 demonstrated that cough particles can carry substantial concentrations of bacteria from lower respiratory infections. each patient coughed 10 times into the device to ensure sufficient aerosol collection. sputum specimen was mixed with 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), homogenized with pipetting and vortexing. resultant solution was divided into 400 L aliquots and stored at -80\u00b0C. extracted nucleic acid was tested for P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and S. mitis targets by individual real-time PCR assays. enzyme activation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. all subjects completed specimen collection safely. 10 healthy subjects were used for controls. sputum specimens were positive for CFRB in 15/15 (100%) samples. sputum specimens had a 93% rate of oral commensals. cough specimens had no commensals and were positive in 65% of CF patients. six sputum specimens were not tested for S. mitis C T values. small values indicate higher quantities of colony forming units (CFU) 8/12 (67%) sputum and cough specimens had concordant positives. 6 of these eight were positive for additional bacteria in sputum. differences demonstrate that the cough device is not just collecting sputum. the majority of exhaled gas passes out of the end of the RTubeTM as only water condensate is intended to be collected. the majority of exhaled gas passes out of the end of the RTubeTM as only water condensate is intended to be collected. the majority of exhaled gas passes out of the end of the RTubeTM. C T values in the sputum specimens ranged from 19\u201338, whereas the range in cough specimens was 33\u201343. the background noise level of the virgin filter is >60, allowing limits of detection by PCR that may be more sensitive to lung CFRB. both CF and TB patients can produce aerosols with viable pathogens. but the amount of pathogens produced by individuals varies greatly 31. the quantity of pathogens in a cough may be a critical metric in transmission of infectious disease, controlling epidemics, and monitoring colonization. a new device can collect lung pathogens from adult patients with CF from cough aerosols with identification using molecular assays. the device excludes oral contaminants showing higher specificity than sputum samples. the data in this study suggest an alternative to sputum collection."}
