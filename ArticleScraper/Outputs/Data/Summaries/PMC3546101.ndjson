{"summary": "respiratory viral infections are common causes of upper respiratory infection (URI) and are often associated with bacterial or fungal co-infections (5, 6). respiratory viral infections cause progression from URI to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and are frequently associated with bacterial or fungal co-infections (5, 6). Respiratory samples were collected from patients who visited the emergency room or were hospitalized when eligible subjects had febrile episodes or respiratory symptoms. 402 respiratory specimens were collected from 358 clinical episodes that occurred in the 116 children of the 175 consecutive HSCT cohort. clinical diagnosis was classified as URI and LRTI. lymphopenia was defined as absolute lymphocyte count below 200 cells/L. each clinical episode was defined as an independent clinical episode. transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for 12 respiratory viruses; rhinovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, influenza virus types A and B, human coronavirus (hCoV) 229E/NL63, OC43 and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) co-detection was defined as a detection of 2 respiratory viruses. results were considered statistically significant when the P value was less than 0.05. clinical characteristics of 175 patients who underwent HSCT consecutively are summarized in Table 1. respiratory viral infection Respiratory viruses were identified from 89 episodes (28.2%) that occurred in 58 children (49.6%) Rhinovirus was detected most frequently, in 25 episodes (28.1%), RSV in 23 (25.8%), adenovirus in 12 (18.0%), hCoV in 10 (11.2%), influenza virus B in 3 (3.4%), PIV-1 in 2 (2.2%) and hMPV in 1 (1.1%). clinical diagnoses were URI in 55 (61.8%) episodes and LRTI in 34 (38.2%) episodes. URI was more commonly associated with LRTI than URI (33.3%). 89 clinical episodes developed in 58 HSCT patients, 3 died of respiratory failure directly related to respiratory viral infection. one patient who underwent bone marrow transplantation for relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia died of acute respiratory distress after an adenoviral infection. HSCT patients with respiratory viral infections HSCT, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; PBSCT, peripheral blood stem cell transplantation; DCBT, double cord blood transplantation; BMT, bone marrow transplantation. more than 2 viruses were co-detected in 8 patients. the monthly distributions of respiratory viruses are shown in Fig. 1. Rhinovirus was detected year around and RSV was prevalent between December and March (82.5% of total isolates). hCoV (90.0%, P = 0.053) seemed to present more commonly as. URI was more commonly associated with LRTI (66.7%) than URI (33.3%). clinical diagnoses were URI in 55 (61.8%) episodes and LRTI in 34 (38.2%) episodes. 66 episodes (74.2%) recovered without pulmonary complications or intervention. a third patient, who underwent PBSCT, was hospitalized for relapsed acute myelodysplastic leukemia. a PIV-3 infection occurred during immunosuppressant treatment for GVHD. after PIV-3 was confirmed, her respiratory distress aggravated. the reported frequency of RSV infections has varied from 35% to 49%; influenza virus infections from 11% to 45%; PIV infections from 8% to 30%; and rhinovirus infections from 4% to 9% (15, 21) this study demonstrated that rhinovirus was the most common isolate (37.0%) in HSCT patients (22) respiratory viral infection triggered respiratory dysfunction, and their death was probably related to respiratory viral infection. there are few antiviral therapeutic options against respiratory viruses except influenza virus. graft-versus-host disease, taking history of immunosuppressant agents, and separation principle of hospitalized patients cannot be investigated. this effort is meaningful considering aspects that show the common prevalence of respiratory viral infection in HSCT children."}
