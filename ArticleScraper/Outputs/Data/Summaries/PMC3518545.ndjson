{"summary": "Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a macrophage-tropic lentivirus that can cause persistent infection in equids. the infection is characterized by recurring febrile episodes associated with viremia, fever, thrombocytopenia, and wasting symptoms (11,23). in the past 30 y, a variety of EIAV experimental vaccines have been developed. vaccines using a regimen of DNA vaccine prime/viral vector vaccine boost have been observed to elicit stronger humoral and cellular immune responses than vaccination with either vaccine alone. however, so far, there are no data to confirm whether this vaccination strategy can induce potent protection-associated immune responses in horses. pDRVI-SV1.0-Env-Syn (SV1.0-Env-Syn) and pDRVI-SV1.0-Gag-Syn (SV1.0-Env-Syn) encoded wild-type env and gag genes of pLGFD3V in SV1.0 respectively. in vitro expression of synthetic EIAV genes and their corresponding wild-type genes was compared through Western blotting (WB) 293T cells were transfected with SV1.0 vector control, SV1.0-gag-wild (native gag), SV1.0-gag-syn (codon-optimized gag), SV1.0-env-wild (native env), or SV1.0-env-syn (codon-optimized env) at 48 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting using 30 g 143TK cells were grown in Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin\u2013L-glutamine. the cells were washed with Eagle's medium containing glutamine and antibiotics in the absence of fetal bovine serum. wild-type Tiantan vaccinia virus was inoculated at a multiplicity of infection. EIAVLNV is a high-virulence EIAV strain and was used as the challenge strain in this study. PLGFD3Mu12V and DLV34 are two relatively heterologous virulent variants of EIAVLNV. their virulence and env sequences have been described previously. horse D/V1 was inoculated with empty vectors (SV1.0 and wild-type TTV) at the same doses, route, and schedule as rD/V1, rD/V2, and rD/V3. horses were challenged through the hypodermal injection of 1 mL of virus stock (1000 copies/mL of viral RNA) of EIAVLNV at week 104 and observed until death. horses vaccinated with EIAVFDDV were collected at months 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 post-vaccination. plasma samples were stored at 20\u00b0C for antibody assays. whole blood samples were used for platelet enumeration. clinical episodes of EIA were defined as thrombocytopenia. izing activity against pLGFD3V (L) and the end-point titer of p-26 specific antibodies (O) were compared between serum samples collected from 3 horses vaccinated with DNA/rTTV vaccines at 2 wk following each boost with rTTV vaccines. 4 horses vaccinated with EIAVFDDV at 5 and 6 mo post-inoculation. the serum neutralizing activity against homologous (pLGFD3V) virus strains was assessed with a modified indirect cell ELISA-based infectious center assay method. the serum neutralizing activity against DLV34 was assessed with an RT assay. an additional two plasmids, SV1.0-Env-Wild and SV1.0-Gag-Wild, were constructed as controls for in vitro expression. the properties of the expression vector pDRVI-SV1.0 have been previously described (18,29) 293T cells were transfected with SV1.0 vector control, SV1.0-gag-wild (native gag), SV1.0-gag-syn (codon-optimized gag), SV1.0-env-wild (native env), or SV1.0-env-syn (codon-optimized env) at 48 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting using 30 g monolayers of 143TK cells were grown in Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin\u2013L-glutamine. the cells were washed with Eagle's medium containing glutamine and antibiotics in the absence of fetal bovine serum. the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 0.5% CO2. horse rD/V1, rD/V2, and rD/V3 were vaccinated with 10 intramuscular injections of 4 mg of SV1.0-Env-Syn. horses were vaccinated with 10 intradermal injections of 2109 pfu of rTTV-Gag-Syn/rTTV-Env-Syn. all of the horses were challenged through the hypodermal injection of 1 mL of virus stock (1000 copies/mL of viral RNA) of EIAVLNV at week 104. whole blood and plasma were collected at weeks 0, 38, 69, 90, and 104. rD/V3 died from an accident in week 94. plasma samples were stored at 80\u00b0C for quantitative and qualitative analysis of EIAV in the plasma. rectal temperature and clinical status of all surviving horses were recorded twice per day throughout the trial. clinical episodes of EIA were defined as thrombocytopenia (100,000 platelets/L whole blood), occurring with fever (rectal temperature 39\u00b0C), and a concurrent high level of plasma viral RNA. serum antibody end-point titers are presented as the log10 of the highest reciprocal dilution yielding reactivity two standard deviations above background. the neutralizing activity is presented as the mean reciprocal dilutions of serum that neutralized 50% of input EIAV virus measured in an infectious center assay. pLGFD3Mu12V was assessed with a modified indirect cell ELISA-based infectious center assay method using a constant amount of pLGFD3V or pLGFD3Mu12V. serum neutralizing activity against DLV34 was assessed with an RT assay as previously described. pLGFD3V neutralizing activity was assessed with an RT assay as previously described (9). the main band was located at approximately 130 kDa (for the samples from transfected 293T cells/infected primary chicken embryo fibroblast cells), or 95 kDa (for the samples from transfected equine dermal cells) the bands were markedly thicker in the lanes with samples of the DNA vector encoding the wild-type env or gag gene. the housekeeping gene -actin presented comparable expression in all of the samples from transfected 293T DV-vaccinated horses, 3 were protected from infection and 1 was protected from death after challenge with EIAVLNV. Fig. 2A, D, G, and J show the development of Env-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against the homologous strain pLGFD3V. two weeks after the sixth DNA vaccination, the mean end-point titer, avidity index, and conformation ratio of Env-specific antibodies were 1:70, 26%, 0.29, and 1:1 end-point titer, avidity index, and conformation ratio of Env-specific antibodies gradually increased to a plateau after 4 or 5 mo post-vaccination. pLGFD3V-neutralizing activity peaked at month 2 or 3 and remained constant until the day of challenge. pLGFD3V-neutralizing activity peaked at month 2 or 3. horses vaccinated with EIAVFDDV plateaued between 1 and 3 mo post-vaccination. the end-point titer of p26-specific antibodies plateaued between 1 and 3 mo post-vaccination. however, the end-point titer of the p26-specific antibodies was higher in the former samples than the latter samples. antibodies and neutralizing antibodies induced by this strategy lacked durability compared to those induced by the attenuated vaccine EIAVFDDV. on the same day, the 4 horses vaccinated with EIAVFDDV and one nave control horse were also challenged with EIAVLNV using the same dose and route. all of the serum and plasma samples collected at 5 (for rD/V1, rD/V2, and D/V1) time points before challenge were AGID- and viral 3 horses (AV2, AV3 and AV5) were protected from infection. 1 horse (AV1) was protected from death during 253-day post-challenge observation period. studies of lentiviral attenuated vaccines have indicated low levels of antigen presentation are required to achieve and sustain adequate immune maturation. multiple DNA priming vaccinations only achieved low titer and a transient antibody response to HIV Env. high titer, avidity, and persistent IgG responses to influenza virus H1 were seen after the first DNA vaccination (21) these data suggest that mature specific antibodies against lentiviral Env may be more difficult to induce using DNA vectors. we did not observe any serum neutralizing activity against the TTV vector. these results suggest that a rapidly induced but not pre-existing neutralizing antibody response to the TTV vector might contribute to the inhibition of further maturation of Env-specific antibodies after the second boost with rTTV vaccines. in this context, immunization with the recombinant TTV-vectored vaccines via a heterologous mucosal route may be a more effective way to reduce this a vaccination regimen based on EIAV DNA vaccine priming and recombinant TTV vaccine boost failed to protect vaccinees from death following wild-type EIAV challenge. immature Env-specific antibodies and the lack of broadly neutralizing antibodies may partly account for this protection failure."}
