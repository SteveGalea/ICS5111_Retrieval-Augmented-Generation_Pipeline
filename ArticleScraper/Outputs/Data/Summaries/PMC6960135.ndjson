{"summary": "the development of new viral vaccines should be increasingly focused on biosafety, especially to remove the viral genetic material. vaccines such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitope vaccines have been experimentally researched in animals for the ongoing control of viral diseases. there are considerable challenges and specific requirements in the development of novel vaccines to prevent PRRS, such as the CTL-epitope vaccine (8, 9). the greatest challenge is that PRRSV can markedly suppress the swine immune defense system (10) swine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I has been referred to as swine lymphocyte antigen (SLA-I) there are three classical SLA-I loci (SLA-1, SLA-2, and SLA-3) in the swine genome. SLA-I molecules can present viral peptide epitopes to swine CD8+ T cells. the potential SLA-1*1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching four typical genetic PRRSV strains were identified. our results provide a novel strategy, i.e. the use of the MHC-restricted structural mechanism, to identify and validate CTL epitopes.

SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was used to determine the efficiency of tetramerization. expressing the SLA-1*1502 alleles were divided into three groups. for initial immunization, the group was injected with the NSP9-TMP9 peptide mixed with CFA. the PBMCs were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C in staining buffer. the cells were then washed once with staining buffer and detected via flow cytometry. more than 106 cell events were acquired for each sample. SLA-1*1502 showed better PRRSV peptide-binding ability than others. all nine peptides could form complexes with SLA-1*1502 and swine 2m (pSLA-1*1502). the NSP9-TMP9 peptide is fixed by 15 hydrogen bonds with residues in the N- and C-termini of the PBG. the non-apeptide is shown in stick representation between the 1 domain and 2 domain of pSLA-1*1502. in most MHC I molecules, the residue at position 167 is Trp (32) due to the small Ser167 residue, the N-terminus of the PBG of SLA I molecules appears to be more open than in other MHC I molecules. OE1 Tyr7, Ala24, Val25, Val34, Met45, Glu63, Lys66, and Val67. the amino acid sequences of the PBGs of SLA-1*1502, SLA-1*0401, and SLA-3*hs0202 were aligned. the hydrophobic B pocket accommodates the non-polar side chain of P2-Met via the VDWs provided by the surrounding residues. the residue composition of SLA-1*1502 is similar to that of SLA-1*0401, and only the residue at position 66 (Lys/Val) is different. the turn between P3 and P4 of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide is much sharper than that in the other two peptides. previous studies on SLA-1*0401 and SLA-3*hs0202 showed that the residue at position 156 plays a key role in peptide binding by fixing the P3 residue with a salt bridge or hydrogen bond. the binding stabilities of P2-Ala, P3-Ala, and P9-Ala mutant peptides are significantly lower than that of the wild-type NSP9-TMP9 peptide. the binding stabilities of the pSLA-1*1502 complex are significantly lower than that of the wild-type NSP9-TMP9 peptide. CD spectra were used to assess the thermostability of purified pSLA-1*1502 complexes. denaturation was monitored at 218 nm as the temperature was ramped up from 25 to 90\u00b0C at 1\u00b0C/min. bars with different colors show the Tm values of different peptides. the uncharged D pocket of SLA-1*1502 might accommodate various uncharged P3 residues, unlike those of SLA-1*0401 and SLA-3*hs0202. Peptides with P3-Ala cannot provide sufficient affinity, unlike larger amino acids, such as L, M, F, S, N, and P (Table 1). RDRP contains 13 conserved peptides. peptides matching the motifs of the pSLA-1*1502 complex are indicated by bars. red indicates the conserved peptides in four PRRSV strains. a total of 10,000 events were recorded by the flow. the ratio of pSLA-1*1502 tetramer and CD8 double-positive cells was at a rate of 0.5\u20131%. the MLV-immunized group was significantly higher than in the control group (P = 0.0355) there was no significant difference between the MLV+NSP9-TMP9-immunized group and the MLV-immunized group (P = 0.0538) swine IFN- expression in the peripheral blood of each pig was detected according to the methods used by Kumar and Walker (34, 35) biotinylated pSLA-1*1502-BSP was mixed with streptavidin MagneSpheres. Lane 6 contains supernatants from first, second, third, and fourth washings. pigs in control group were injected with PBS, deionized water. the secreted IFN- content of the control group and immunized group was less than the lowest detectable limit (78 pg/mL) the secreted IFN- content of the control group was less than the lowest detectable limit (78 pg/mL) the root mean square differences between SLA-1*1502 and two other solved p/SLA I structures were found to be 0.446 and 0.592 respectively. the NSP9-TMP9 peptide is fixed by 15 hydrogen bonds with residues in the N- and C-termini of the PBG. the pockets of pSLA-1*1502, p/SLA-1*0401, and p/SLA-3*hs0202 are compared in Figure 3. the pockets of pSLA-1*1502 are composed of leu5, Tyr7, Phe33, Tyr59, Glu63, Tyr159, Leu163, Ser167, and Tyr171, are highly conserved. complex Peptide Hydrogen bond partner Van der Waals contact residuesa Residue Atom SLA-1*1502 /s2m/TY9 P1-Thr N Tyr7 OH Leu5, Tyr7, Phe33, Tyr59, Glu63, Tyr159, Leu163, Ser167, Tyr171 OH O Tyr159 OH OG1 Ser167 OG Tyr171 OH P2-Met N Glu63 OE1 Tyr7, Ala24, Val25, arrows indicate -strands, and orange cylinders denote -helices. residues at position 156 in the D pocket are indicated with a red star. the hydrophobic B pocket accommodates the non-polar side chain of P2-Met. pSLA-1*1502 and p/SLA-1*0401 can accommodate P9-Tyr. only two different residues were found between the two F pockets. the turn between P3 and P4 of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide is much sharper. peptide NSP9-TMP9 was mutated by alanine scanning (19), and CD spectra were used to test the stability of pSLA-1*1502 complexes with these mutant peptides. the binding stabilities of P2-Ala, P3-Ala, and P9-Ala mutant peptides are significantly lower than that of the wild-type NSP9-TMP9 peptide. bars with different colors show the differences in the refolding efficiencies of the pSLA-1*1502 complex with alanine scanning peptides. bar graph of the thermostability of the pSLA-1*1502 complex is shown. the binding peptides have a large overlap at the P2 and P9 residues. the B pocket of SLA-1*1502 accommodates multiple uncharged residues, while the F pocket mainly binds Phe, Tyr and Trp. the in vitro refolding results for the peptides supported this reasonable speculation. 9-mer SLA-1*1502-binding peptides exist in each of these four PRRSV strains. only 30 peptides were found to be completely conserved in all four strains. RDRP contains 13 conserved peptides, which is a much greater number than in the other proteins. six Landrace pigs expressing the pSLA-1*1502 genes were used to check the immunogenicity of NSP9-TMP9 peptide. the ratio of pSLA-1*1502 tetramer and CD8 double-positive cells was at a rate of 0.5\u20131% in the MLV+NSP9-TMP9-immunized group, which was significantly higher than in the control group. biotinylated pSLA-1*1502-BSP was mixed with streptavidin MagneSpheres. Lane 1 contains the supernatant from biotinylated pSLA-1*1502-BSP. pSLA-1*1502-BSP was mixed with streptavidin MagneSpheres. at day 14, the MLV+Peptide group was injected with the NSP9-TMP9 peptide mixed with CFA. the MLV group was injected with MLV mixed with CFA as the second immunization. Pigs in control group were injected with PBS, deionized water mixed with CFA, and deionized water mixed with IFA. the structure of SLA-1*1502 is very similar to those of SLA-1*0401 and SLA-3*hs0202. the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1*1502 is determined by the three pockets B, D and F together. the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1*1502 is determined by the two pockets B, D and F together. SLA-1*1502 was predicted in silico to present more PRRSV peptide epitopes than other SLA-I alleles cloned from Landrace pigs. in vitro refolding results confirmed that most of the predicted PRRSV peptides could be bound by SLA-1*1502. RDRP (especially NSP9/10/11) may be the best target for developing a PRRSV vaccine to induce a CTL response to genetically heterologous strains. the absence of SLA-I tetramers limits effective and convincing research on swine antiviral CTL responses. the results increase our understanding of how to acquire a viral CTL vaccine against swine PRRS disease. the results increase our understanding of how to acquire a viral CTL vaccine against swine PRRS disease.
