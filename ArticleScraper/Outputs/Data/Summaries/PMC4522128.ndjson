{"summary": "PEDV was first detected in the u.s. in may 2013 and spread rapidly across the country. some serological assays for PEDV have been previously described. but few were readily available in the united states. ISA and bELISA showed a sensitivity and specificity of 97.9 and 97.6 %; and 98.2 and 98.9 %, respectively. kappa agreement was calculated to be 0.941 between iELISA and IFA, 0.945 between bELISA and IFA."}
