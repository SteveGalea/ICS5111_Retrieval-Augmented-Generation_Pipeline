{"summary": "the re-emergence of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in 2003 has caused 262 fatal cases among a total of 442 infected individuals. there is an urgent need to develop an effective and safe vaccine against the divergent H5N1 viruses. matrix protein 2 (M2) is the most conserved. the native M2 protein exists as a homotetramer formed by two disulfide linked dimers. the 24-amino-acid extracellular domain of M2 protein (M2e) is conserved across influenza A subtypes. mice were vaccinated with 10 g of M2e-MAP plus Freund's or aluminium (alum) adjuvant. the highest titer was 1:105 and 1:104 for M2e-MAP+FCA/FIA and M2e-MAP+alum, respectively, at 10 days post last boost vaccination. mice were challenged with 10LD50 of H5N1 virus, clade1: VN/1194 or clade2.3.4: SZ/406H (B.) five days post-challenge, lungs were removed from infected mice. infectious virus titers in the lung tissues were measured to determine protective effects of M2e-MAP vaccine on viral clearance. mation, pulmonary vascular dilatation, congestion, infiltration of prominent number of lymphocytes accompanied by exudates and severe edema. in contrast, lungs of M2e-MAP-vaccinated mice exhibited less histopathological changes, accompanied by mild pulmonary interstitial pneumonia and moderate lymphocytic infiltration. most vaccinated mice with clinical signs only exhibited slight or partial piloerection for 2-3 days and then recovered. the observed protection against clinical signs correlated with the changes in body weight. in the adjuvant group, body weight dramatically decreased and even reached a near 25% severe weight loss after H5N1 virus infection. M2e-MAP immunization induced potent M2e-specific antibody responses. mice were vaccinated with 10 g of M2e-MAP plus Freund's or aluminium (alum) adjuvant. the highest titer was 1:105 and 1:104 for M2e-MAP+FCA/FIA. two weeks after last boost, mice were challenged with 10LD50 of H5N1 virus. clade1: VN/1194 or clade2.3.4: SZ/406H were selected to evaluate the protective immunity afforded by M2e-MAP vaccine in vivo. damage in the pulmonary airways and parenchymal tissues in the adjuvant group, including severe damage of bronchial epithelium with necrosis and desquamation, pulmonary vascular dilatation and congestion. infiltration of prominent number of lymphocytes accompanied by exudates and severe edema, especially around vessels. lungs of M2e-MAP-vaccinated mice showed less histopathological changes, accompanied by mild pulmonary interstitial pneumonia and most M2e-MAP vaccinated mice with clinical signs only exhibited slight or partial piloerection for 2-3 days and then recovered. compared to the adjuvant control, M2e-MAP vaccinated mice that did not survive the challenges were observed to have delayed the onset of illness. no H5N1 virus was detected in the lungs of surviving mice. the lung tissues of these mice presented almost normal structures. the above data confirmed that M2e-MAP vaccine can afford cross-protection against lethal challenge of divergent H5N1 viruses. high titers of M2e-specific antibody responses could be induced following immunization of M2e-MAP plus Freund's adjuvant, a common adjuvant for human vaccines. the antiviral effect of M2e-based vaccines was mediated by antibodies to M2e antigen. clade categorization of the VN/1194 and SZ/406H strains was based on the phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene. the clade2.3.4 viruses seem to have been prevalent in china since late 2005 and were also responsible for human infection in laos, Malaysia and Vietnam [26,27], which included A/Hunan/2/2009. tetra-branched M2e-MAP vaccine could provide cross-protection against divergent HPAI H5N1 viruses. such vaccine could be used in combination with current H5N1 influenza vaccines to enhance protection and prevent a possible future human pandemic of H5N1 influenza. peptide was purified by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) the purified peptide was characterized by amino acid analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) Mice Female BALB/c mice at 4-6 weeks were purchased from the laboratory animal unit. mice were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine (75/5 mg/kg) and intranasally (i.n.) challenged with 10LD50 of clade1: VN/1194 or clade2.3.4: SZ/406H H5N1 virus stain. infected mice were observed and weighed daily for 2 weeks. ten-fold serial dilutions of samples were added in quadruplicate to the monolayer of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells seeded at 96-well cell culture plates 12 h before infection. fresh medium was then added to the cells and continued to incubate for 72 h. hemagglutinin (HA) test indicated as follows. oc-Lys(Fmoc)]2-Lys-Cys(Acm)-Ala-Wang Resin was purified by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) the purified peptide was characterized by amino acid analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) prime vaccinated with M2e-MAP (10 g/mouse) plus Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA, sigma) mice were also intramuscularly (i.m.) vaccinated with the same amount of M2e-MAP immunogens plus alum adjuvant (Sigma) at the same condition of the above. assay was developed using 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) the reaction was stopped by adding 1N H2SO4. the absorbance at 450 nm was measured by an ELISA plate reader. euthanized mice were aseptically removed and homogenized in minimal essential medium (MEM) plus antibiotics. the significance between survival curves was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test. other data were analyzed using the 2-tailed Student's t test."}
