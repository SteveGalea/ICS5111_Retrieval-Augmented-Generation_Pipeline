{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses are the largest group of viruses. a common trait of these viruses is the cytoplasmic replication of their genomes in association with modified cellular membranes. a common trait of these viruses is the cytoplasmic replication of their genomes in association with modified cellular membranes. coexpression of two transmembrane NSPs of EAV, NSP2 and NSP3 is sufficient for the induction of membrane rearrangements, including DMVs. the mechanism and host factors essential for the generation of these structures remain, however, largely unknown. the nonlipidated form of LC3 is associated to the EAV-induced DMVs. dsRNA produced by EAV colocalizes with LC3 and EDEM1. dsRNA molecules localize to the virus-induced membrane rearrangements involved in RNA synthesis. ER, lysosomes, autophagosomes and EDEMosomes used antibodies recognizing the proteins disulfide isomerase (PDI), lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), LC3 and EDEM1 respectively. PDI and LAMP1 were not colocalizing with dsRNA-positive puncta induced by EAV. a similar degree of colocalization was detected during the entire course of the EAV infection BHK-21 cells were infected with EAV and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 16 h. they were processed for conventional electron microscopy (EM) to localize proteins to the EAV-induced DMVs. the same results were obtained using Vero E6 cells as well. dsRNA is localized into the interior of the DMVs, confirming the dsRNA-positive puncta observed by immunofluorescence are DMVs. dsRNA is localized to the interior of the DMVs, thereby confirming the dsRNA-positive puncta observed by immunofluorescence are DMVs. dsRNA is also localized to the interior of the DMVs. no significant differences in viral titer could be observed between autophagy-deficient atg7/ and wild-type atg7+/+ MEFs. replication of EAV in autophagy-deficient cells was unaffected because numerous dsRNA-positive puncta could be readily detected. nonlipidated LC3-I is associated with DMVs ATG7 is part of the set of ATG proteins that mediate lipidation of LC3-I into LC3-II. the colocalization of dsRNA with LC3 in the atg7/ MEFs implied that nonlipidated LC3-I associates with the EAV-induced DMVs. LC3-I (LC3-HA) (A) and LC3 (GFP-LC3) (B) were transfected with plasmids expressing either C-terminally HA-tagged nonlipidated LC3-I (LC3-HA) (A) or N-terminally GFP-tagged LC3 (GFP-LC3) (B) at 48 h post transfection, cells were inoculated with EAV. infected cells were lysed and protein extracts were processed for western blot analysis. antibody recognizing LC3, N protein or tubulin was used as a loading control. end point 10-fold dilutions of an EAV stock were titrated on indicated transfected cells. dsRNA puncta encodes a fusion protein of NSP2 and 3 (NSP2-3). expression of LC3 singly, in contrast, did not have the same effects. first we analyzed the localization of GFP-tagged NSP3 and NSP2-3 using the vaccinia virus expression system. cells in which LC3 was depleted showed a similar NSP2-3GFP distribution pattern as cells positive for LC3. these results suggest that LC3 is not recruited to and it is not essential for the formation of membrane rearrangements induced by NSP2-3. dsRNA molecules have been shown to localize to the virus-induced membrane rearrangements involved in RNA synthesis. vero E6 cells were thus infected with EAV and fixed at 16 h post infection (p.i.) before being processed for immunofluorescence analysis. as expected, no dsRNA was detected in noninfected cells. insets show enlargements of the boxed areas. dsRNA puncta colocalizing with indicated marker protein signals. Error bars represent the standard deviation from counting 50 cells in 3 independent experiments. cryo-sections were labeled with antibodies against dsRNA (top right panel), LC3 (top or bottom left panel) or both (bottom right panel) the size of the gold particles is indicated in the image double labeled sample. autophagy marker protein GFP-LC3 was redistributed into puncta and increased cellular levels of LC3-II. deletion of atg7, a gene essential for autophagy,35 affected replication of EAV. no significant differences in viral titer could be observed between autophagy-deficient atg7/ and wild-type atg7+/+. dilutions of an EAV stock were titrated on Atg7+/+ and atg7/ MEFs. TCID50 units per ml were calculated, indicating that Atg7 deletion does not affect EAV entry, replication or egress. ectopically expressed LC3 (GFP-LC3), a conventional protein marker for autophagosome membranes37,38, did not show appreciable colocalization with the dsRNA-positive structures. results show that lipidation is not required for LC3 recruitment onto the EAV-induced DMVs. dsRNA puncta are not autophagosomes, in agreement with EAV replication not dependent on a functional pathway. dsRNA was synthesized in infected cells upon depletion of LC3. LC3 is required for EAV life cycle. a back-transfection experiment was performed to confirm the effective depletion of LC3. nonlipidated LC3 restores EAV replication in LC3-depleted cells. cells were cotransfected with siRNA directed against LC3A and LC3B (siRNALC3) and the plasmid expressing nonlipidated LC3-HA. NSP2-3-GFP exhibited a very different localization pattern in puncta. this protein localizes to the ER when singularly expressed. LC3 and EDEM1 were recruited to NSP2-3-positive structures. LC3 is not recruited to and it is not essential for formation of membrane rearrangements. dsRNA-positive puncta contain the EDEMosome and autophagosome marker proteins EDEM1 and LC3 respectively, but not those of the ER (PDI) or lysosomes. the association of LC3 to the DMV surface was confirmed by IEM. studies have indicated that LC3 is associated with the DMVs induced in cells upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus or mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) the nonlipidated form of LC3 is associated with a large proportion of the MHV-induced DMVs. LC3-I is recruited to EDEMosomes and possibly MHV-induced DMVs. despite these differences, the DMVs induced in coronavirus-infected cells are connected to additional membrane rearrangements. despite these differences, EDEM1 and MHV-induced DMVs recruit LC3-I. LC3 is not recruited to or required for the membrane rearrangements induced by expression of an EAV Nsp2-3 fusion protein. it is not yet clear to what extent the DMVs induced by expression of an EAV Nsp2-3 fusion protein resemble DMVs observed in EAV-infected cells or rather correspond to biogenesis intermediates. fluorescence microscopy Cells were grown on coverslides and processed for immunofluorescence analysis as previously described. cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing either GFP-LC334 (a kind gift of Karla Kirkegaard, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University) or LC3-HA25 using Lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen, 11668-019) cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES pH 6.8, 2% CHAPS and protease inhibitors) before adding sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes before being analysed with antibodies against LC3 (nanotools, 0231-100/LC3-5F10) plasmid encoding a C-terminally GFP-tagged fusion of NSP3 was constructed by conventional cloning as follows. first, the NSP2-3 encoding fragment was amplified by PCR reaction from a plasmid containing a cDNA clone of EAV (pEAV515)52 using appropriate primers. subsequently, the NSP2-3-coding sequence was cut from pGEMNsp2-3EAV DMEM without FCS containing 10 units of Lipofectin (Invitrogen, 18324-020) and 1 g of the pTUG31 expression plasmids. incubation continued at 37\u00b0C for another 3 h. data represent the percentage of colocalized puncta per cell. primary immunological reactions were performed with polyclonal antisera against LC3 (Novus Biologicals, NB600-1384), PDI (a kind gift of Masakazu Kikuchi, Department of Physiology, Kansai Medical University) or monoclonal antibodies recognizing the HA tag (a kind gift of Guojun Bu, Washington University), dsRNA or LAMP1 (Dianova, ABR-30253) antibodies against LC3 (nanotools, 0231-100/LC3-5F10), N protein (a kind gift from Stuart Siddell, University of Bristol) and tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, T9028) were used for detection. one day after seeding, the vero E6 cells were transfected with 40 nM of siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000. T7 transcription-regulatory element (designated pTUG31Nsp2-3EAVGFP) was constructed by conventional cloning as follows. first, the NSP2-3-coding sequence was amplified by PCR reaction from a plasmid containing a cDNA clone of EAV (pEAV515)52 using appropriate primers. subsequently, the NSP2-3-coding sequence was cut from pGEMNsp2-3 culture medium was replaced by fresh FCS-containing culture medium. incubation was continued until cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence analysis. data represent the percentage of dsRNA foci colocalizing per cell."}
