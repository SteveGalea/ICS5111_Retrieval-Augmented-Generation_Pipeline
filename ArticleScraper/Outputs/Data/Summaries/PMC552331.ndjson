{"summary": "health relations with other nations in the field of health constitute an important sub-set of health policy. these health relations encompass a range of interactions with consequences for health, including: membership of global and regional bodies; the negotiation of international agreements; action to counter particular external threats to health; assistance to developing countries; and international trade and investment in health-related goods and services. the voluntary nature of WHO standards and regulations can be accepted or rejected by member states. the department of health and ageing was closely involved with international comparative health data projects. the department of health and ageing was closely involved with international comparative health data projects. a reciprocal health care agreement with Norway was signed. the arrangements are \"cost neutral\" and do not include costly accounting or administrative procedures. the continuing \"internationalisation\" of Medicare by the Liberal-National Party coalition is paradoxical. the new regulatory arrangements have created a virtual trans-Tasman free market in food and therapeutic drugs. the department of health and ageing has had memoranda of agreement with its counterparts in china, Indonesia, Thailand and Japan. in 2003 further activities were undertaken under the auspices of these agreements. emergence and rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) to several countries in East and Southeast Asia and to Canada revived popular atavistic fears of pandemics. a special meeting of health ministers, attended by Australia, was organized by Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to discuss the situation. a total of $ 1.8 b. was allocated to health-related international development assistance. security, good governance and counter-terrorism were emphasized as the focus for the official foreign aid programme. the lower priority of health was further underscored by a decision to no longer appoint designated health advisors to the permanent staff of AusAID. the protection of health in free trade arrangements is important for their domestic legitimacy. health links have served to promote good will in some otherwise difficult relationships, as has been case with Indonesia."}
