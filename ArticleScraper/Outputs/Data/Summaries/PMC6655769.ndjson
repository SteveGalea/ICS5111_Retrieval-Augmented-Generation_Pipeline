{"summary": "emerging viral pathogens are major threats to global public health. emergence is typically the result of zoonotic virus spill over from animal reservoirs into human populations. viruses similar to both SARS- and MERS-CoV are currently circulating in bats. we characterized the daily variation of different peripheral blood cell populations in a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection and pathogenesis until 4 days post infection. we observed significant modulation of leukocytes in MERS-CoV infected mice which was virus dose dependent and measurable prior to notable weight loss. this data highlight the predictive value of hematology in this model. mice were acclimated to the BSL3 environment for one week prior to infection. male and female 288/330+/+ mice were anaesthetized with ketamine and xylazine. mouse adapted MERS-CoV maM35C4 in 50l of virus collection medium. mice were sacrificed and the inferior right lung lobe was harvested, frozen at -80 C and then used to measure virus lung titer by plaque assay. on days 1\u20133 post infection, mice were sacrificed and the inferior right lung lobe was harvested, frozen at -80 C and then used to measure virus lung titer by plaque assay. all antibodies were purchased from Biolegend, unless otherwise noted, and were titrated prior to use. erythrocytes were lysed using a fixable live/dead Dye (Invitrogen) depletion resulted in a minimum of 28,000 events (range 28,000\u2013153,000; mean 82,000 events) cellular populations were further defined as i) \u201clymphocytes\u201d which included T cells (CD3+), B cells (CD19+), NK cells (CD3+NK1.1+CD49b+), and iii) \u201cmonocytes\u201d (CD115+), and iii) \u201cneutrophils\u201d (Ly6G+) mice were acclimated to the BSL3 environment for one week prior to infection. mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups, anaesthetized with xylazine and infected intranasally with 5.0 x 104 plaque forming units. lobe was harvested, frozen at -80 C and then used to measure virus lung titer by plaque assay. after 30 seconds, the maximum recoverable volume of PBS (generally 500\u2013800l) was collected and stored in Eppendorf tubes until prompt vetScan analysis. flow cytometry performed on the identical BAL and whole blood samples. antibody staining, erythrocytes were lysed using a fixable Live/Dead Dye (Invitrogen) cellular populations were further defined as i) \u201clymphocytes\u201d which included T cells (CD3+), B cells (CD19+), NK cells (CD3+NK1.1+CD49b+), and iii) \u201cmonocytes\u201d (CD115+), and iii) \u201cneutrophils\u201d (Ly6G+) [13\u201315]. 10-week-old female 288/330+/+ mice were mock infected (PBS, gray) or infected with 5.0 x 104 PFU maM35C4 (red) per independent experiment, 4 animals/day/group were harvested on 1, 2, 3, and 4dpi. per day, the inferior right lung lobe was harvested, stored at -80 C until titration by plaque assay of clarified homogenized tissue. all cell frequencies are expressed as a percentage of total WBCs. each symbol represents the data from one mouse. the line is at the mean and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean. in infected animals, the numbers of lymphocytes were significantly reduced (P = 0.0004) on 2dpi compared to mock. lymphocyte frequency was reduced in infected animals on 2-4dpi. ERS-CoV infected animals were consistent and invariant over time. we combined the independent frequencies of T cell, B cell, NK cell and NK T cell subsets to generate an aggregated \u201clymphocyte\u201d frequency. monocytes and neutrophil frequencies as measured by flow cytometry in blood were significantly elevated following MERS-CoV infection. the line is at the mean and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean. each data point represents the data from one mouse. asterisks denote statistical significance (P 0.05) study bled live mock and MERS-CoV infected mice via submandibular bleed to obtain longitudinal CBC data per mouse. the studies described in previous figures were all performed with a dose of MERS-CoV in between (i.e. 5E+04 PFU) those described in Fig 5. Similar to previously reported data, we observed MERS-CoV dose dependent weight loss. MERS-CoV infection caused significant lymphopenia on 2 and 3dpi. the numbers of neutrophils were elevated on 1dpi with the lethal dose. this increase was kinetically delayed in the sublethal dose to 2dpi. the number of neutrophil cells in mock or MERS-CoV infected mice described in A. for the box and whisker plots in A, B, C, D and E, the line is at the median, the box extends from the 25th to 75th percentile and the whiskers encompass the range. flow cytometry remains the ideal application for evaluating immune population dynamics in these kinds of samples. we infected 288/330+/+ mice with either PBS (mock) or 5E+04 PFU of the mouse adapted MERS-CoV strain maM35C4 and harvested blood and lung tissue for analysis each day after infection. the inferior right lung lobe was harvested, stored at -80 C until titration by plaque assay of clarified homogenized tissue. whole blood was harvested, and 50l was mixed with EDTA and analyzed via VetScan HM5. in mock and MERS-CoV infected mice, levels of total WBCs were not significantly modulated over time with consistent and unvarying cell count and frequency readings. by 2dpi, neutrophil (P 0.0001) and monocyte (P = 0.03) counts and frequencies were significantly elevated in MERS-CoV infected animals. lymphocyte frequency was reduced on 2dpi as compared to mock. other metrics (i.e. RBC counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, etc.) were not modulated by MERS-CoV infection. we then performed Pearson Correlation analysis to compare the frequencies of lymphocytes, neutrophils and monocytes from both flow cytometry and VetScan HM5. however, the overall trends of cell population frequency modulation as measured by either flow cytometry or VetScan HM5 from the entire time course were remarkably similar. Pearson correlation analysis of data from mock infected mice. kinetic frequencies of blood lymphocytes (circles), neutrophils (squares) and monocytes (triangles) are correlated. for A and B, the correlation coefficient (R squared) and p-values are indicated in each plot. compared with mock, sublethal and lethal doses of MERS-CoV. all groups were significantly different from each other beginning 2dpi. CBC derived from cardiac puncture and submandibular bleed of mice is equivalent. neutrophil elevation kinetics in peripheral blood was differentially modulated with virus dose. in mice infected with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV, there was a positive correlation between weight loss on 3dpi and the percentage and total numbers of neutrophils in blood on 1dpi. asterisk indicates statistically different values by two-Way ANOVA. weight loss on 3dpi in high dose MERS-CoV (5E+05 PFU) infected mice is correlated with % neutrophils in peripheral blood on 1dpi. linear regression was performed to determine correlation. models often rely on animal weight loss, a relatively non-specific marker, to chronicle disease which may overlook critical markers of disease progression and severity. in kinetic studies, we compared data generated by an automated veterinary hematology analyzer, VetScan HM5 to those from standard flow cytometry. this technique requires technical expertise, expensive reagents and equipment. the data from the VetScan HM5 could serve to inform experimental design (i.e. choose timepoints) and simplify more rigorous immune cell phenotyping by flow cytometry for BSL3 pathogens. small animal models of emerging viral pathogenesis are fundamental tools that further our understanding of human infectious diseases. a thorough understanding of the kinetics of blood cell population modulation can help in determining stage of the infection, clinical severity and inform possible therapeutic avenues. a study comparing sublethal and lethal doses of MERS-CoV found that neutrophil numbers in the peripheral blood on 1dpi correlated with degree of body weight loss 3dpi in the lethal dose group. onset of significant weight loss were predictive of disease severity. neutrophils in peripheral blood prior to the onset of severe clinical disease may serve as a predictive biomarker of severe MERS-CoV disease in mice. the inclusion of the CBC should elevate, increase the biological relevance and translation of future studies of emerging virus pathogenesis. tocrit and platelets are not modulated after MERS-CoV infection. each symbol represents the data from one mouse. the data are combined from two independent studies. each time point per group is created from 8 individual mice. on days 3 and 4 post infection contained sufficient cellular density to generate a VetScan reading within range. Flow cytometry analysis of BAL samples from experiments 1 and 2 was possible."}
