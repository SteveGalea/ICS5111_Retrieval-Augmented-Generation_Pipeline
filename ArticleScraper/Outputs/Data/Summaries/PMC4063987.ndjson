{"summary": "non-pharmaceutical public health interventions may provide simple, low-cost, effective ways of minimising the transmission and impact of acute respiratory infections. the aim of this synthesis was to explore public perceptions of non-pharmaceutical interventions that aim to reduce the transmission of acute respiratory infections. acute respiratory infections represent a significant public health issue. they place a continual and considerable burden on public health. they place a continual and considerable burden on public health. they place a continual and considerable burden on public health. non-pharmaceutical interventions for respiratory infection control Behaviour Definition Isolation Staying home if symptomatic for at least 7 days (minimising contact with other household members) to reduce peak incidence of respiratory infection. factors that influence the adoption of non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control include perception of risk, anxiety and efficacy beliefs. this has been demonstrated in both anticipated and actual respiratory infection outbreaks e.g. SARS coronavirus outbreak and H1N1 2009 pandemic. synthesised qualitative literature on non-pharmaceutical public health interventions. the aim was to synthesise the literature on public perceptions of non-pharmaceutical interventions that aim to reduce transmission of acute respiratory infections. the last search was conducted on 26th February 2013. we adopted a pre-planned, comprehensive search strategy. no language restrictions or year limits were applied to searches. qualitative studies were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) quality assessment tool. this tool enabled independent critical review of the quality of our identified studies. one paper was excluded following appraisal as it reported no details about data collection, management and analysis. the list of codes generated for each paper was then systematically compared and developed as subsequent papers were coded. initial themes and sub themes were developed and refined through discussion with MS, AG and LY. ET then carried out consistency checks on the text coded to each theme and sub theme. the last search was conducted on 26th February 2013. we adopted a pre-planned, comprehensive search strategy. no language restrictions or year limits were applied to searches. papers were reviewed and corresponding authors of included papers contacted. details about study design, participants (number and characteristics), type of non-pharmaceutical intervention and study context (timing, location, type of respiratory infection) were extracted into a Microsoft Word template. each paper was read repeatedly to become familiar with the data. findings from each paper were then extracted verbatim and imported into Nvivo version 9.2. coding manual was produced to ensure transparent coding of the data. 10 studies focused on an actual respiratory infection outbreak/pandemic, namely SARS and the H1N1 2009 pandemic. included studies explored multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions or combined mitigation strategies involving pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. personal protective measures were most commonly studied (n = 10) focus groups to examine perceptions of infection control measures in the context of pandemic influenza. to characterize public perceptions about social distancing measures likely to be implemented during pandemic. ive) Semi structured -think aloud

2009 (Pandemic, 2009) 48 members of the general public. focus groups (11) Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Joffe & Yardley, 2004) ISOLATION & REMOTE CARE (Social isolation, remote health care & vaccination) to explore people\u2019s beliefs, perceptions, reasoning, and emotional and contextual factors. seven key themes identified: perceived benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions, perceived disadvantages of non-pharmaceutical interventions, personal and cultural beliefs about infection transmission, diagnostic uncertainty in emerging respiratory infections, perceived vulnerability to respiratory infection, anxiety about emerging respiratory infections and communications about emerging respiratory infections. actions Isolation and distancing are believed to be socially responsible actions and seen as necessary for the protection of society as whole [41,42] 2 Perceived disadvantages of non-pharmaceutical interventions a Hand washing for respiratory infection control is irrelevant Additional hand washing behaviours are seen as irrelevant by those who class themselves as regular hand washers. public reassess the risk/impact of a new respiratory infection according to personal experience vs. information presented in the media [40] [46,49,51] [43] b High anxiety if perceived to be more vulnerable Greater anxiety experienced during an emerging respiratory infection outbreak is seen overhyped. chronic kidney disease patients in Hong Kong saw mask wearing as a useful way to demonstrate their desire to be socially responsible and protect themselves and others during H1N1 2009 pandemic. this was related to social stigma experienced by CKD patients during SARS, where they were perceived publically as high risk \u2018super spreaders\u2019 of infection. if you can\u2019t go to church for one week because everyone\u2019s sick, then you know, call everybody on the phone or something. non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control was seen as problematic for some in terms of its perceived irrelevance. concerns about frequent hand-washing attracting social stigma were evident in various infection contexts. mask wearing, although seen by some as an effective precaution, could generate concern about attracting discrimination. other perceived drawbacks revolved around potential negative impact of adopting non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control. common perceived barriers to social isolation and personal distancing from those who were symptomatic seemed to relate to perceived emotional costs. people who were quarantined during SARS reported feeling segregated and stigmatised for being infected. people seemed to consider the feasibility of distancing behaviours in terms of the economic impact. common perceived obstacles to staying home if sick and social distancing during the H1N1 2009 pandemic were economic pressures to continue to work. personal and cultural beliefs about respiratory infections were evident across various infection contexts. such beliefs are likely to influence the perceived efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly social isolation. the public seemed to evaluate their vulnerability to respiratory infection in terms of perceived health status and proximity to the origin of outbreak. this suggests that people do not see it as their role to self-diagnose in an emerging respiratory infection outbreak. a common belief expressed was that \u2018others\u2019 were at increased risk of infection. the public appeared to focus on their lack of geographical proximity to the origins of an emerging respiratory infection outbreak. a common belief was that a novel respiratory virus was unlikely to originate in a \u2018modern, developed country\u2019 so they would have more time to prepare and cope better if and when it reached them. in a pandemic context, the concept of geographical proximity was challenged. it was recognised that respiratory viruses could spread worldwide quite rapidly and to more geographically remote locations due to air travel. the public also appeared to evaluate their susceptibility to a new respiratory infection in terms of their own living environments. novelty factor (shock of the new) appeared to affect public anxiety in the early stages of an emerging outbreak. novelty factor (shock of the new) appeared to affect public anxiety in the early stages of an emerging outbreak. this could be a further example of people distancing themselves from threat. people with other health issues expressed less worry about becoming infected. communication efforts are seen as unreliable, premature, inconsistent, sensationalist and unduly alarmist. a common belief was that media reporting in an emerging outbreak is over-hyped or can amplify the risks. the public evaluated their personal risk by comparing personal experiences with the \u2018official\u2019 information they have been given. this inconsistency may lead to public fatigue about respiratory infection communications. studies were published between 2005 and 2012 and represented the views of 1,022 participants from 9 different countries. the majority of studies recruited members of the general public with varying demographics and in different contexts. the majority of studies recruited members of the general public with

Non-pandemic H1N1 2009 pandemic S1 S2 N1 N2 P1 P2 P3 1 Perceived benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions a Hand and respiratory hygiene is common sense/familiar Hygiene behaviours are seen as familiar and acceptable in varying contexts and populations. an emerging respiratory infection is seen as confusing and concerning and can lead to uncertainty about when to adopt infection control [36,37] [46,49-52] [43,45] 5 Perceived vulnerability to respiratory infections a Perceived health status Evaluating one\u2019s vulnerability to respiratory infection in terms of own perceived health status and the health of others. chronic kidney disease patients in Hong Kong saw mask wearing as a useful way to demonstrate their desire to be socially responsible and protect themselves and others during the H1N1 2009 pandemic. mask wearing was seen not only as an effective but also as a visibly demonstrative method of respiratory infection control, which could reduce social stigma. isolation and social distancing behaviours were viewed as acceptable in some contexts. isolation and social distancing behaviours were viewed as acceptable in some contexts. isolation and social distancing behaviours were viewed as acceptable in some contexts as a way of being socially responsible (i.e. protecting wider society) a mask being seen to explicitly indicate infection/illness in the wearer could generate concern about attracting discrimination. potential to attract social stigma and cause embarrassment or discrimination was another perceived downside of adopting personal protective measures. mask wearing could generate concern about attracting discrimination. common perceived barriers to carrying out personal protective measures appeared to relate to personal impacts. common perceived barriers to social isolation and personal distancing from those symptomatic seemed to relate to perceived emotional costs. people who were quarantined during SARS reported feeling segregated and stigmatised for being infected. personal distancing was viewed as unacceptable within households and some cultural groups. concerns about being able to observe specific cultural practices and greeting protocols seemed to outweigh the perceived need to adopt personal distancing behaviours. personal and cultural beliefs about respiratory infections were evident across various infection contexts. personal and cultural beliefs about how respiratory infections are caught and spread were evident across various infection contexts. such beliefs are likely to influence the perceived efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly social isolation. diagnostic uncertainty in emerging respiratory infections People seemed to acknowledge that a degree of uncertainty is to be expected in an emerging respiratory infection such as SARS. this suggests that people do not see it as their role to self-diagnose in an emerging respiratory infection outbreak. this could influence the likelihood of implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social isolation and using remote healthcare when symptomatic. a common belief expressed was that \u2018others\u2019 were at increased risk of infection, including people with chronic health problems, those in particular occupations (e.g. teachers), and those with impaired immune systems. this may result in people viewing non-pharmaceutical interventions to minimise the spread of infection as more applicable to others than to themselves. in a pandemic context, the concept of geographical proximity was challenged. it was recognised that respiratory viruses could spread worldwide quite rapidly and to more geographically remote locations due to air travel. the public also appeared to evaluate their susceptibility to a new respiratory infection in terms of their own living environments. anxiety about emerging respiratory infections appeared to affect public anxiety in the early stages of an emerging outbreak. novelty factor (shock of the new) appeared to affect public anxiety in the early stages of an emerging outbreak. some people with other health issues expressed less worry about becoming infected as they saw their current health issues as more pressing. some people with other health issues expressed less worry about becoming infected as they saw their current health issues as more pressing. some people felt that they were not given all the facts during the H1N1 2009 pandemic or that its severity was prematurely downplayed. a common belief was that media reporting in an emerging outbreak is over-hyped or can amplify the risks. the public doubted the credibility of information being presented. this inconsistency may lead to fatigue about respiratory infection communications. a blunting of advice messages on non-pharmaceutical interventions may influence behavioural responses. public consider perceived costs and benefits of non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control. widespread endorsement of non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control was highlighted by the synthesis. however, such endorsement of non-pharmaceutical interventions may not accurately reflect people\u2019s beliefs about these behaviours. socio-economic barriers to adopting social distancing behaviours were highlighted in the synthesis. this is consistent with previous research that has shown lack of access to child care and financial barriers with regards to social isolation exist. synthesis of qualitative research is one possible interpretation of the data. synthesis incorporates people\u2019s perceptions of different non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control behaviours. hygiene and respiratory hygiene appeared to be well-established concepts in the minds of participants. there were particular concerns about personal distancing and the wearing of masks in some contexts. the synthesis also suggested the perceived necessity, efficacy and feasibility of adopting non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control may be influenced by personal and cultural beliefs. the public do not see it as their role to self-diagnose and feel uncomfortable about taking on the perceived role of the doctor. promotion of self-diagnosis and accessing remote healthcare is vital to reduce spread of respiratory infection and avoid overstretching healthcare services. interpretation suggests an important role of emotional and sociocultural factors in shaping individual ways to perceive and react to respiratory infection risk. synthesis provides helpful insight into how the general public process the risk of respiratory infection and evaluate the feasibility of non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control. positive framing of advice messages might improve perceived relevance of non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control to those who do not acknowledge they could be at risk of infection. further research is needed to clarify how best to reframe advice. some members of the public have doubts about the relevance of non-pharmaceutical respiratory infection control, its adverse impact and potential to attract social stigma.
