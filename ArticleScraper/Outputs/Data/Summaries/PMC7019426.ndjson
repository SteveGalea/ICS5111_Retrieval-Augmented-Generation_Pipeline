{"summary": "the role of the receptor Siglec-1/CD169, a sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin-1 expressed by DCs, has greatly contributed to our understanding of how viruses subvert DC activity. despite the immune activity exerted by DCs after viral infection, it has been known that viruses evolved different strategies to escape DC antiviral activity. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 [24,25,26] and EBOV [22,27,28,29] incorporate such sialylated ligands within their membranes as an integral part of the gangliosides that are dragged from the plasma membrane. the role of Siglec-1 during viral infection has been mostly studied in murine models. the pathogenicity of the infecting retrovirus is key to tip the balance of these macrophages in favor of the protective immune function. the antiviral response dominates when the replicating virus has an expanded tropism [35], as it also happens in the case of the amphotropic VSV infection [32,33]. pDCs may produce type I IFNs in response to EBOV infection in vivo. bacterial translocation was suspected during a case of gram-negative septicemia in an EBOV-infected patient. pDCs may produce type I IFNs in response to EBOV infection in vivo. plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are considered the most potent type I IFN producers in blood. their capacity to secrete IFN in response to HIV-1 sensing has been demonstrated in vitro. pDC activation in response to HIV-1 sensing induces IFN secretion through toll-like receptor (TLR) -7 and -9 signaling. in vitro pDCs exposed to EBOV do not secrete IFN [67], activated pDCs have been found in EBOV-infected nonhuman primates. a cleaved and secreted form of EBOV glycoprotein signals through TLR4 [71], although IFN secretion in response to these glycoproteins remains unexplored. the presence of type I IFNs throughout the course of these viral infections is well-established. the role of type I IFN responses is controversial. the protective role of type I IFN responses is controversial. the role of siglec-1 in DC infection and antigen presentation. siglec-1 facilitates HIV-1 infection of antigen presenting cells (APCs) in most DC subtypes, however, the restriction factor SAMHD1 inhibits reverse transcription. EBOV employs different receptors to attach to target cells. de-phosphorylated form of the host factor sterile alpha motif histidine-aspartate domain-containing protein 1 is the most potent restriction factor that limits HIV-1 infection in DCs [97] if this lack of infectivity is actually beneficial for an immune control remains controversial. absence of viral replication impairs viral sensing and limits presentation of HIV-1-specific antigens to prime adaptive immune responses [98,99,100] DCs are highly susceptible to EBOV infection [11,103], and this is a complex process that involves several host factors whose function is still being identified. EBOV attachment to the DC surface is mediated by several receptors that recognize different elements on the viral membrane and often have a redundant activity. EBOV macropinocytosis allows trafficking into late endosomes. cleavage of viral glycoproteins by cathepsin B (CTSB) facilitates interaction with the endosomal receptor Niemann\u2013Pick C1. so, siglec-1-mediated attachment facilitates viral access to the cell cytoplasm [22] resistant infected DCs transfer viral antigens to resistant DCs. secretion of extracellular vesicles bearing antigen-loaded fragments is among the most effective ones. this mechanism also promotes viral trans-infection. extracellular vesicles exit this compartment to present antigens to T cells via immune synapse formation. exit of HIV-1 leads to trans-infection of CD4+ T cells. in EBOV, viral dissemination to other target cells needs further investigation. mature or activated DCs downregulate their macropinocytic capacity. they are still able to capture, process, and present antigens internalized via endocytic receptors. the fate of trapped extracellular vesicles on DCs is diverse. they provide a source for antigen cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells. siglec-1 directs captured HIV-1 particles to the same VCC where Ebola viral particles are retained [22], that is in addition the same compartment where extracellular vesicles are trapped in activated DCs [63,123]. in the case of HIV-1 recognition, viral entry via Siglec-1 favors the transfer of trapped viruses to bystander CD4+ T cells. siglec-1 expression on different anatomical compartments and viral dissemination routes. cells are capable of capturing HIV-1 and mediate viral transmission to target CD4+ cells via trans-infection. at the endocervix, basal Siglec-1+ DCs may mediate local HIV-1 trans-infection. in the cervical mucosa, there are two major sources of antiviral type-I IFN responses after retroviral infection. resident myeloid cells and pDCs are the most potent producers of IFN [44] and are soon recruited to the cervix [143]. increased antiviral IFN secretion could limit initial viral infection, but it could promote viral capture on cervical myeloid cells via Siglec-1 induction. cytokine TGF-1 is abundant in semen, and it upregulates Siglec-1 expression on DCs. this receptor could also boost systemic viral spread as previously suggested for HIV-1. future work should address if other enveloped viruses causing relevant human infectious diseases may contain sialylated gangliosides on their membranes. zygosis [160] indicates that the role of this protein is not essential. developing such pharmacological agents could pave the way to ameliorate viral dissemination. exploiting the immune-surveillance function of Siglec-1 receptor to induce antiviral immune responses may also prove valuable."}
