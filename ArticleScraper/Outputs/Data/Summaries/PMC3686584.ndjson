{"summary": "human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are the second-leading cause of childhood gastroenteritis worldwide. this virus is commonly found in environmental waters and is very resistant to water disinfection and environmental stressors. PCR alone does not allow the discrimination between infectious and non-infectious viral particles. ICC-RT-qPCR was able to detect as low as 1 102 HAdV genome copies per milliliter of infectious viral particles in the environmental water samples. results indicate a lack of proper public health measures. waterborne viral infection is one of the most important causes of human morbidity. a combination of cell culture and PCR has allowed detection of infectious viruses that grow slowly or fail to produce cytopathic effects in cell culture [7,8] Integrated cell culture PCR (ICC-PCR) has the benefits of cell culture and PCR and attempts to compensate for several disadvantages. this method has a disadvantage in that detection of nucleic acids of inactivated viruses from environmental samples adsorbed onto cell receptors without cell infection can result in false positives [10]. the average equivalence of a PFU unit for GC was 3.4 logs. the average equivalence of a PFU unit for GC was 3.4 logs. this means that 102 PFU is equivalent to 105 GC. ICC-RT-qPCR was more sensitive than the PA for detecting infectious particles in environmental water samples. 10 of 12 lagoon water samples contained undamaged viral particles. of these, only 3 samples contained infectious particles detectable by ICC-RT-qPCR. total of 19 samples that contained infectious or undamaged HAdV particles were sequenced for molecular characterization. the obtained sequences were compared with the ones already deposited in NCBI. a sequence of bovine adenovirus (BovAdV-7, GenBank accession number AY288821) was used as an out group. the average equivalence of a PFU unit for GC was 3.4 logs. this means that 102 PFU is equivalent to 105 GC. ICC-RT-qPCR assay was more sensitive than the PA in the detection of HAdV. infectious per PA* 66.0 (8/12) 8.0 (1/12) 33.0 (4/12) Undamaged** 1.65 106 7.72 105 1.24 106 Infectious by ICC-RT-qPCR** 4.80 105 3.69 103 2.18 104 Infectious by PA*** 1.07 102 3.33 100 3.33 101 * Rate (%). qPCR and 4 contained infectious or undamaged HAdV particles. the obtained sequences were compared with those already deposited in NCBI. the sequences were presented 95-99% identical to sequences of HAdV serotype 2 of subgroup C. this study presents data on the integrity, infectivity and molecular characterization of HAdV in water samples collected over a period of 1 year from Florian\u00f3polis. the impact caused by water contamination of enteric viruses has been less studied than the impact caused by bacteria and protozoa. in many countries, the water quality is evaluated according to bacteriological standards. ICC-RT-qPCR showed greater sensitivity and speed of detection of infectious viral particles compared to PA. ICC-RT-qPCR had a detection limit of 1102 GC/mL at 24 h. the integrity of HAdV particles was positively correlated with their infectiousness. HAdV-2 is one of the serotypes most commonly excreted by humans. this virus is intermittently excreted in the feces of most individuals, even if they are asymptomatic. some substitutions in the amino acids sequences were observed and analyzed. the method consists of filtration, concentration, and elution of viral particles in water samples through a negatively-charged membrane. the final sample was approximately 10 mL before centrifugation at 1,500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the concentrated samples were stored at 80\u00b0C until further analysis. a known amount of previously inactivated HAdV-2 was added in concentrated samples (previously HAdV-2 negative) of all sites and in nuclease-free water (NFW) as a control. the reactions were performed using 1 U of DNAse (sufficient quantity to degrade 100% of DNA added), 1 buffer and 180 L of sample or NFW. the enzyme was inactivated with EDTA 25 mM and incubated for 10 minutes at 65\u00b0C se Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium contains 4% FBS, 0.1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 U/mL penicillin, 10 g/mL streptomycin and 26 mM MgCl2. the samples were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 7 days. the agar overlay was removed, and the cells were stained with 20% Gram\u2019s crystal violet and the plaques counted macroscopically. a known concentration of HAdV was spiked into 2 L of each water matrix. the samples were concentrated, and the viral recovery was assessed by plaque assay (PA) and by integrated cell culture-RT-qPCR (ICC-RT-qPCR) decimal dilutions of concentrated seeded water samples were created and analyzed. the molecular characterization was conducted with MEGA 5.0 software [49]. the homology analyses were inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Kimura 2 - parameter model and calculated using pairwise deletion. Bootstrap was resampled as a test of phylogeny using 500 replications. nucleic acid was eluted in a 60 L elution buffer and stored at 80\u00b0C. a reverse transcriptase reaction was performed to generate cDNA from mRNA. water samples were previously treated with 10 U/mL penicillin, 10 g/mL streptomycin and 0.025 g/mL amphotericin B. the cells were then removed and overlaid with 0.6% Bacto-agar (previously melted) in high glucose DMEM 2X (high-glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium) the protocol was adapted from Rigotto et al. (2005) and Ko et al. (2003). water samples, in a non-cytotoxic dilution, were inoculated in triplicate. after 1 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C with rotation every 15 min, the inoculum was removed and the cell layers were overlaid with high-glucose DMEM. after incubation, the supernatant was recovered and 0.2 amplicons were purified with ExoSAP-IT (GE Healthcare UK Ltd, Buckinghamshire, UK) each product was sequenced four times in both directions. the quality of DNA sequences was checked and overlapping fragments were assembled using the BioEdit package 7.0.5 [47] and ContigExpress (InforMax, Inc.) consent obtained from the patient for publication of this report and any accompanying images.
