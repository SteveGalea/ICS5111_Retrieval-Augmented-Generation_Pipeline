{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus first isolated from a rhesus macaque in 1947. most infections are asymptomatic or show mild clinical symptoms, such as fever, headache, or rash. some adults infected with ZIKV present with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) ZIKV vaccine candidates under development include inactivated virus, live attenuated virus, DNA, mRNA, viral vectors, virus-like particles (VLPs) none are approved for use in humans. subunit vaccines do not contain live virus or normally elicit adverse side effects and are safe for use in humans including pregnant women and unborn offspring. a combination of Alum and MPL has been approved for use with conjugated vaccines for a number of viruses, including influenza virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) the protocols have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the national research council. the recombinant EDIII protein was transiently expressed in the culture supernatant of 293T cells, and purified by protein A affinity chromatography. mice were intramuscularly (i.m., 100 L/mouse) immunized with EDIII protein (10 g/mouse, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA), MPL (10 g/mouse, InvivoGen), Alum (500 g/mouse ELISA plates were washed with PBST for 3 times and incubated with serial dilutions of mouse sera and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) or IgG-Fab (1:2000) antibodies at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. reaction was visualized after addition of 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrate. three recent ZIKV human strains, including R103451 (2015/Honduras), PAN2016 (2016/Panama) and PRVABC59 (2015/Puerto Rico), were used in the study. Briefly, viruses were grown in vero E6 cells and detected for viral titers using a plaque-forming assay. splenocytes were isolated from immunized mice 3 days post-ZIKV challenge. they were stained for surface markers using a blocking anti-interferon-/ receptor 1 antibody (2 mg/mouse, Leinco Technologies, Fenton, MO, USA); and 24 h later, they were intraperitoneally (i.p.) challenged with ZIKV. 11TM anti-mouse interleukin 4 (IL-4), and Brilliant Violet 605TM anti-mouse IL-17 antibodies were analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD LSRFortessa 4 system) qRT-PCR This assay was performed to detect ZIKV RNA copies in sera and tissues of challenged mice. mice sera (about 10 L) and tissues, including eye, heart, spleen (about 20 mg), muscle, and testis (about 40 mg) were collected 3 days post-challenge. detection limit was about 103 RNA copies/mL (for sera), 5 102 RNA copies/g (for eye, heart, and spleen), and 2.5 102 RNA copies/g (for muscle and testis) mice were immunized with EDIII protein (10 g/mouse), alum (i.e., aluminum hydroxide, 500 g/mouse, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA), MPL (10 g/mouse, InvivoGen), Alum (500 g/mouse) + MPL (10 g/mouse), or MF59 (50 L/mouse) as controls. mouse sera and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) or IgG-Fab (1:2000) antibodies were washed with PBST overnight at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. reaction was visualized after addition of 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrate and stopped with 1N H2SO4. the detection limits were about 20 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/mL for sera, 50 PFU/g for eye, or 25 PFU/g for heart, spleen, muscle, and brain tissues. immunized mice were challenged with ZIKV as previously described. splenocytes (2 106 cells/well) were isolated from immunized mice 3 days post-ZIKV challenge. cells were stained for intracellular markers using PE anti-mouse interferon-gamma, Brilliant Violet 711TM anti-mouse interleukin 4 (IL-4) and Brilliant Violet 605TM anti-mouse IL-17 antibodies. qRT-PCR was performed to detect ZIKV RNA copies in sera and tissues of challenged mice. the detection limit was about 103 RNA copies/mL (for sera). Statistical significance of all data among different groups was calculated using one-way ANOVA: Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test. *, **, and *** indicate p 0.05, p 0.01, and p 0.001 respectively. results 3.1. Comparison of the Adjuvanticity of Alum, MPL, MF59 and in combination, for Immunization with ZIKV EDIII. mice were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with PBS (background control) or with ZIKV EDIII without an adjuvant, or with aluminum salts (Alum), monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), Alum + MPL, or MF59 adjuvant. fusion of hFc to the EDIII subunit vaccine did not affect the generation of ZIKV-specific IgG antibodies. c)-specific antibody levels were determined by ELISA using sera collected at seven days following the second dose of ZIKV EDIII. EDIII alone induced a good IgG1 response while the IgG2a response was noticeably weaker. combination of Alum with MPL adjuvant induced higher IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies than either Alum or MPL alone, or when MF59 was the adjuvant. in contrast, Alum generated a Th2-biased IgG1 antibody response, while EDIII alone showed a slight Th2 bias. neutralizing antibody titers induced by EDIII were significantly higher when Alum was used in combination with MPL than for Alum, MPL, or MF59 as the sole adjuvant. the combination of Alum with MPL adjuvant only induced a background-level neutralizing antibody (Figure 3A\u2013C) levels of secretion of IFN- (Th1), IL-4 (Th2) and IL-17 (Th17) by CD45-positive (CD45+)\u2013CD4+ T cells, and IFN- and IL-4 by CD45+\u2013CD8+ T cells. EDIII without an adjuvant did not induce a strong EDIII-specific T cell response. immunized mice were challenged with a high-dose ZIKV one day after administering an anti-Ifnar1 antibody. a significant reduction in viral titers was observed for mice immunized with EDIII alone. e immunized with EDIII formulated with a single adjuvant had significantly reduced viral titers compared to those immunized with EDIII alone (sera, heart, spleen, muscle, and brain) the combination of Alum with MPL adjuvant resulted in significantly lower, or undetectable, viral titers than other immunization conditions with a single adjuvant. mice immunized with EDIII alone had only slightly lower levels of ZIKV RNA in sera and tissues (eye, heart, spleen, or muscle) compared to those immunized with PBS (Figure 6A,B,D), confirming that an adjuvant is required to induce protection. a single adjuvant reduced the level of viral RNA more than immunization with EDIII alone or with PBS. viral RNA copies were the lowest in testis of mice receiving EDIII formulated with Alum and MPL in combination. MPL did not appear to enhance the antibody response to EDIII. EDIII protein was fused with hFc tag, but IgG antibodies targeting hFc were also generated. fusion of hFc to the EDIII subunit vaccine did not affect the generation of ZIKV-specific IgG antibodies. ZIKV EDIII-, E-, or Fc of human IgG1 (hFc)-specific antibodies were determined by ELISA using sera collected at seven days following the second dose of ZIKV EDIII. EDIII alone induced a good IgG1 response while the IgG2a response was noticeably weaker (Figure 2D,E). when used alone, Alum induced higher levels of IgG1 (but not IgG2a) antibodies than EDIII without an adjuvant, while MPL induced significantly higher levels of IgG2a (but not IgG1) antibodies. V strains (R103451, PAN2016, and PAVABC59) induced a significantly stronger neutralizing antibody response than EDIII alone. the neutralizing antibody titers induced by EDIII were significantly higher when Alum was used in combination with MPL than for Alum, MPL, or MF59 as sole adjuvant. V EDIII-Specific Cellular Immune Response Splenocytes isolated from immunized mice three days after ZIKV challenge were used to investigate if the adjuvants enhanced the ZIKV EDIII-specific cellular immune response. we determined levels of secretion of IFN- (Th1), IL-4 (Th2) and IL-17 (Th17) by CD45-positive (CD45+)\u2013CD4+ T cells, and IFN- and IL Splenocytes were isolated at three days post-challenge with ZIKV (strain R103451) and used to determine secretion of IFN- (A), IL-4 (B) and IL-17 (C) by CD45-positive (CD45+)\u2013CD4-positive (CD4+) T cells, and of IFN- (D) and IL-4 (E) by CD45+\u2013CD8-positive (CD8+) T cells using flow cyto mice immunized with EDIII formulated with a single adjuvant (Alum, MPL, and/or MF59) had significantly reduced viral titers compared to those immunized with EDIII alone (sera, heart, spleen, muscle, and brain) these results suggest that immunization with EDIII is unable to elicit adequate protection against ZIKV challenge. mice immunized with EDIII alone had only slightly lower levels of ZIKV RNA in sera and tissues (eye and spleen) compared to those immunized with PBS (Figure 6A,B,D), confirming that an adjuvant is required to induce protection. a single adjuvant (Alum, MPL, and/or MF59) resulted in a significantly lower level of ZIKV RNA in sera and tissues (eye, heart, the detection limits were 103 RNA copies/mL (sera), 5 102 RNA copies/g (eye, heart, and spleen) and 2.5 102 RNA copies/g (muscle and testis) the detection limits were 103 RNA copies/mL (sera), 5 102 RNA copies/g (eye, heart, and spleen) a single adjuvant (Alum, MPL, or MF59) significantly improved the antibody response over immunization without an adjuvant. however, the highest IgG titers were obtained when Alum and MPL were used in combination. a combination of MPL and Alum adjuvants may shift the immune responses from Th2 to Th1 and generate a more balanced immune response. antibodies, induced by ZIKV vaccines, may block infection. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secrete IFN-, IL2 (Th1), IL-4, and IL-5 (Th2) cytokines to further promote antibody production or directly kill infected cells. the combination of EDIII with individual adjuvants improved protection further. the combination of Alum with MPL significantly reduced viral titers and viral RNA copies in sera and tissues compared to other immunization regimes. EDIII alone without adjuvant(s) resulted in the highest viral titers and viral RNA copies in sera and tissues. the EDIII protein used in this study was fused with a C-terminal hFc tag. hFc-fusion proteins have been approved by the FDA for human therapy. a ZE-Fc has been shown to mimic native dimeric status of E protein and induce higher neutralizing antibodies than a monomeric E protein without Fc (monZE) EDIII formulated with Alum, MPL, or MF59 induced a specific antibody and cellular immune response. the greatest vaccine efficacy was achieved when combined in a single vaccine."}
