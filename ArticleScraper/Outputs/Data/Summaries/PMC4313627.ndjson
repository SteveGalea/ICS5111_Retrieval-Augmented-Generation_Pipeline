{"summary": "influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus spread rapidly throughout the world in 2009. it was most likely established in Australia (18) and Japan (19) before border screening was initiated in those countries. border screening to detect influenza-infected travelers is likely to be unsuccessful because persons with asymptomatic cases can be infectious. the study assumed a 50% detection rate for all incoming infected persons, including those with asymptomatic cases and those incubating the virus. in practice, detection was substantially lower than that. the models had also not been validated using data from an influenza pandemic (26) there is an opportunity to validate the models examine the efficacy of border measures. a substantial amount of resources were spent on border-screening measures in several countries, including Australia. cases of asymptomatic infection and persons in the incubation period do not appear to be infectious (27,28). if contacts are quarantined until beyond the incubation period, transmission will be limited (29). if contacts are quarantined until beyond the incubation period, this will also limit further transmission. two independent modeling studies modeled the effect of entry screening for SARS on SARS importation and subsequent spread. the authors concluded that entry screening would not reduce the probability of an outbreak of 100 cases by >7%. both studies concluded that entry screening would play a minimal role in reducing the number of imported cases. the public health response should focus on early identification and treatment of cases at risk of becoming severe. compared with influenza, SARS is more amenable to border screening because fever is a more consistent symptom and infected persons are not infectious when asymptomatic or during the incubation period. travel HANS (T-HANs) have been used in the united states by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) since the 1970s as a communication tool directed to incoming travelers. the use of current communication technologies (e.g., the Internet or short text messages to mobile phones) could also be investigated. warning clinicians in Vancouver, British Columbia, isolated a patient with SARS within 15 minutes of his/her arrival at the clinic. but clinicians in Toronto, Ontario, did not quickly isolate a patient with SARS or use adequate respiratory protection when treating the patient. most attempts at border screening have been ineffectual."}
