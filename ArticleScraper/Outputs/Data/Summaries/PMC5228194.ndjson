{"summary": "tumor microenvironment promotes tumor growth, stimulates angiogenesis, increases inflammatory response and induces metastasis (1\u20134) mouse models of human cancer play a crucial role in cancer research and the screening of anticancer agents (5,6) HB and SUB mouse models were established, and orthotopic tumor cells were obtained from orthotopic tumor masses by primary culture. differentially expressed genes were validated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) the humanized HB models were obtained in may 2013 from elective breast reduction mammoplasty surgery of 3 patients at the The First Affliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. sample collection was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (14), and approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University. the cells were harvested with 0.25% tyrosine and 0.02% disodium EDTA. human breast cancer cells (5105) in 0.2 ml PBS were injected into the implanted human breast tissues 1 week after implantation of the human breast tissue. the primary cultured human breast cancer cells were finally obtained. RNA extraction Total RNA was isolated from primary cells. RNA concentrations and the A260 nm/A280 nm ratio were assessed using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer. reactions were performed on the Eppendorf MasterCycler RealPlex. thermal cycling conditions consisted of 10 min at 95\u00b0C and 40 cycles of 10 sec denaturation at 95\u00b0C, 15 sec annealing at 58\u00b0C, and 45 sec extension at 72\u00b0C. the primer sequences for RT-qPCR are listed in Table I. t-test was used to screen differential genes in the microarray. human breast cancer SUM1315 cells were labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) as previously described (13) animals female severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) CB-17IcrCrl-scidbgBR mice aged 4\u20136 weeks were purchased from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University (nanjing, Jiangsu, China) the mice were kept under specific pathogen-free, temperature-controlled conditions. human breast cancer cells were cultured in fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. the cells were harvested with 0.25% tyrosine and 0.02% disodium EDTA (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) the samples were centrifuged at 129 g for 5 min in a centrifuge. subsequent to discarding the supernatant, the sedimentary tumor pieces were re-suspended in 5 ml DMEM. another 10 ml DMEM was added into the dishes for routine cell culture 16 h later. 500 ng of total RNA was amplified and biotin-labeled with the Ambion Illumina\u00ae total prep RNA Amplification kit. Labeled cRNAs were hybridized to the Illumina HumanHT-12 V4 expression BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.) and imaged using an Iscan system. RT-qPCR was used to verify the gene expression profile results.

RNA concentrations and the A260 nm/A280 nm ratio were assessed using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer. 500 ng of total RNA was amplified and biotin-labeled. labeled cRNAs were hybridized to the Illumina HumanHT-12 V4 expression BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.) the primer sequences for RT-qPCR are listed in Table I. mRNA quantities were analyzed in triplicate and normalized against -actin as a control gene.
