{"summary": "rRT-PCR of sputum samples is commonly used to diagnose MERS-CoV infection. sputum homogenization is desirable prior to nucleic acid isolation. RNA was extracted from pretreated samples using the easyMAG system. rRT-PCR of sputum samples is suitable for homogenizing sputum samples prior to RNA extraction. low viral load early or late in the illness, inadequate sputum samples due to poor sample collection from patients with dry cough or no cough. rRT-PCR of sputum samples yields conflicting results. sputum quality Forty-eight consecutive sputum samples sent to the laboratory for rRT-PCR testing were evaluated in terms of the number of white blood cells, squamous epithelial cells, and ciliated columnar epithelial cells. the sputum samples were graded by using Murray and Washington's grading system. one hundred microliters of proteinase K (1 mg proteinase K/1 mL proteinase K buffer; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to 100 L of sample. sputum samples were mixed with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline. sputum quality Forty-eight consecutive sputum samples sent to the laboratory for rRT-PCR testing were evaluated in terms of the number of white blood cells, squamous epithelial cells, and ciliated columnar epithelial cells. the sputum samples were graded by using Murray and Washington's grading system [9]. one hundred microliters of proteinase K (1 mg proteinase K/1 mL proteinase K buffer; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to 100 L of sample and incubated for 15 min at 55\u00b0C. sputum samples were mixed with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) ERS Virus Detection kit (SolGent, Daejeon, Korea) with bio-Rad CFX96 instrument. sequences of primers and probes used with the DiaPlexQ kit covered the same general regions of the upE and ORF1a transcripts. the minimum Ct values resulted from PK-DNase treatment of three samples, PBS treatment of five samples, and NALC treatment of two samples. the effects of each homogenization method on the MERS-CoV rRT-PCR results were evaluated. differences in Ct values were 5.4\u20137.8 for upE and 4.4\u20136.8 for ORF1a. those for samples treated with PK-DNase or NALC were 4.7\u20135.8 for upE and 4.4\u20135.6 for ORF1a. rRT-PCR results were evaluated using a one-tenth volume of a 1:1,000 dilution of inactivated viral culture. the effects of each method on the MERS-CoV rRT-PCR results were evaluated. the ranges of Ct values for upE from sputum samples were 31.1\u201335.4 using the PK-DNase method, 34.7\u201339.0 using the PBS method, and 33.9\u201338.6 using the NALC method. compared with the control, which were prepared by adding a one-tenth volume of 1:1,000 diluted viral culture to PBS solution. proteinase K is a serine protease that exhibits broad cleavage specificity. the enzyme cleaves peptide bonds adjacent to carboxylic group of aliphatic and aromatic amino acids. proteinase K degrades any RNases present in samples, preventing RNA degradation. treatment with NALC and sodium citrate solution resulted in complete homogenization of sputum samples, including purulent sputum. however, this method is not suitable for detecting MERS-CoV by rRT-PCR. obtaining and testing sputum samples containing ciliated columnar epithelial cells is recommended, if possible. the results may differ from those obtained by using authentic MERS-CoV-positive samples. however, the spiked sputum samples were similar to real sputum samples."}
