{"summary": "FMD is a highly contagious disease affecting artiodactylae, mostly cattle, swine, sheep, goats, and many species of wild ungulates. it is recognized as a significant epidemic disease threatening the cattle industry since the sixteenth century. the history of FMD may be traced to era of Hieronymus Fracastorius. the etiological agent, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is classified within the genus Aphthovirus in the family Picornaviridae. the virus exists in the form of seven serologically and genetically distinguishable types, namely, O, A, C, Asia1, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3, but a large number of subtypes have evolved within each serotype. VP1 is the most immunogenic protein of FMDV [18] having its G-H loop protruded from the surface [19], and is maximally exposed on the capsid surface [16, 20] forming large part (54%) of virus surface [21]. VP1 is the most immunogenic protein of FMDV [18] having its G-H loop protruded from the surface [19], and is maximally exposed on the capsid surface [16, 20] forming large part (54 RT-PCR has been evaluated as a diagnostic tool for FMDV detection in parallel with ELISA and virus isolation. RT-PCR provides relatively fast result, enables quantitative assessment of virus amount, and can handle more samples and/or replicates of samples in a single assay than the conventional RT-PCR procedure. mPCR is an indirect ELISA for detection of antibodies against nonstructural proteins. LPBE is being used for the antigen detection using the material from the lesions. the real-time PCR-based detection method is used in the many reference laboratories in the world for the purpose [7] the first three structural proteins (MW24 kDa) have surface components. the fourth (MW8.5 kDa) is internal. the virion is usually composed of one or two units of VP0. the 5\u2032UTR contains an S fragment at its 5\u2032 end. it folds into long stem loop and plays a role in genome stability. there is a poly \u201cC\u201d tract comprising over 90% \u201cC\u201d residues. the amino terminal L protease is responsible for the cleavage of P1 into 1AB (VP0), 1C (VP3), and 1D (VP1) cleavage occurs at the late stage in virus morphogenesis. cleavage occurs at the late stage in virus morphogenesis and is associated with maturation of capsid. the epidemiology of FMD is complex, and it is affected by different viral, host, and environmental factors. the environment can provide geographical barriers to virus dissemination or, alternatively, promote virus transmission when appropriate atmospheric conditions prevail. pathological Aspect of FMD Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an acute systemic infection affecting even-toed ungulates, both domesticated and wild, including cattle, swine, sheep, and goats. FMDV produces an acute, systemic vesicular disease, which requires a differential diagnosis from other vesicular diseases. infectious virus can be isolated from the oesophagus and throat fluids of the animals from a few weeks up to several years of the initial infection. epidemiological evidence to support the hypothesis that carrier animals may be the origin of outbreaks of acute disease when brought into contact with susceptible animals. complement fixation test (CFT), virus neutralization test (VNT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were developed. most recent is the development of molecular techniques, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method making diagnosis more rapid and precise. clone 7 [112, 113], LFBK cell line and BHK-21 [114] are also susceptible to FMDV. but these are less sensitive than primary cells for detecting low amount of infectivity. the BHK-21 cell culture provides better growth for FMDV than the suspension culture. microneutralization test (MNT) was used for the assessment of antigenic variation in field strains, as it correlated well with cattle protection test. but it was observed that minimal heterotypic contamination in the sample could interfere with precise type identification of the virus. ELISA came into use as diagnostic methods for many infectious diseases around the year 1975. the results can be obtained within 3-4 hours after sample is received. negative sample is confirmed by inoculation of sample into sensitive cultures followed by confirmation of the virus serotype by ELISA. a large number of samples failed to give positive results. a specific RT-PCR was developed and validated for the detection of the polymerase gene (3D) of FMD with an analytical sensitivity equal to 1000 times higher than that of a single passage virus isolation. a cell suspension plaque test on BHK21-CT cells and a reverse transcription nested PCR (RT-nPCR) were used to examine nasal swabs and probang samples obtained from FMDV infected cattle. multiplex PCR is a variant of the test in which more than one target sequence is amplified using more than one pair of primers. mPCR was originally developed to detect distinct/genetic alterations in large regions of human genome. mPCR was used for the detection and differentiation of multiple pathogens/different strains of the same pathogen. mPCR for differentiation of Indian FMDV serotypes has been developed and evaluated on tongue epithelium and cell culture samples. multiplex PCR are more sensitive than sandwich ELISA and virus isolation for detection of FMDV from clinical materials. real-time PCR has engendered wider acceptance of PCR due to its improved rapidity and sensitivity. real-time PCR assays recommended by the world organization for animal health (OIE) for detection of FMDV incorporate universal primers and fluorescent-labeled probes that recognized conserved region within the 5\u2032 UTR [39] or conserved gene regions within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (3Dpol) the use of a specific probe facilitates an increase in specificity compared to conventional agarose-gel PCR assays. real-time PCR is able to detect even twofold changes (e.g., 10 versus 20 copies) the greatest problem facing the diagnostic application of PCR is the production of false positive results. they are attributable to contamination by nucleic acids, particularly from the previously amplified material (carry over) the SDS 7900HT (AB) has successfully identified the FMDV genome and beta actin mRNA from several sources of infected nasal and oral swabs. the performance of rRT-PCR has recently been assessed on milk [179] and \u201cprobang\u201d samples [180] real-time PCR has been compared with VI and antigen-detection ELISA. in heterologous systems were used in ELISA (3ABC ELISA) for serodiagnosis of FMD. four serotypes of FMDV structural proteins expressed in P. pastoris have been successfully assessed in animal model. a recombinant FMDV polyprotein (P1) with 3C expressed in insect cells was evaluated for detecting antibodies to FMDV serotype Asia 1 in ELISA. the VP1 G-H loop was substituted with that from another serotype. this indicated that the VP1 G-H loop may not be essential for the protection of natural hosts against FMDV. if this could be substantiated there would be potential to develop FMD marker vaccines. the distinction between mutants of the same virus is becoming increasingly necessary in view of the extensive variation among representatives of most virus groups [207], the quasispecies population structure of RNA viruses and some DNA viruses [208], and the increasing recognition that one or a limited number of mutations in a viral genome can have a profound effect in its biological behavior [209, 210]. recombinant -galactosidases can be reactivated by anti-3B monoclonal antibodies. recombinant -galactosidases can be reactivated by sera from infected animals. recombinant -galactosidases could be reactivated by sera from infected animals. a nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for the detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was developed. two detection methods, NASBAelectrochemiluminescence (NASBA-ECL) and a newly developed NASBA-enzymelinked oligonucleotide capture (NASBA-EOC) were evaluated. a rapid and easy-to-perform test would circumvent problems associated with the transportation of samples to the laboratory. a rapid chromatographic strip test, lateral flow device (LFD) for pen-side diagnosis based on a monoclonal antibodies that reacts against FMDV of all seven serotypes. the technique permits rapid diagnosis, allowing time for early implementation of control measures to reduce the possibility of spread of FMD. the specificity of the LFA was 98.8%, compared to 100% for the AgELISA. a simple, rapid, colloidal gold-based immuno chromatographic strip tests were developed for easy clinical testing of serotype A of FMDV in field sites. such pen-side diagnosis would have particular benefits in FMD emergencies, relevance to FMD control programmes which operate in endemic regions. guinea pig cross-protection test used 96 well microtiter plates instead of tubes. in the years 1964-1965 CFT was used to replace the virus type identification by guinea pig cross-protection test. Mishra et al. adapted FMDV field isolates to BHK-21 clone 13 cells in 3-7 serial passage. if no CPE is detected the cells should be frozen and thawed, used to inoculate fresh cultures and examined for CPE for another 48 hours. a sandwich ELISA using convalescent bovine immunoglobulin (Igs) as capture and anti-146S guinea pig sera as tracing sera was found suitable for detection and quantification of FMD virus in infected tissue culture fluid and epithelial tissue samples. ELISA results were much more reproducible than those obtained with VNT and are not influenced by variations in tissue culture susceptibility. a sandwich ELISA was developed for detection and typing of FMDV directly from field materials [139]. a large number of samples failed to give positive results and such negative sample has to be confirmed by inoculation of sample into sensitive cultures. there is a need of an alternative assay system that allows more rapid confirmation of clinical diagnosis with more sensitivity. RT-PCR is a variant of the test in which more than one target sequence is amplified using more than one pair of primers. mPCR was originally developed to detect distinct/genetic alterations in large regions of human genome. multiplex PCR arrays have been developed to detect FMDV in infected tissue and food samples. mPCR for differentiation of Indian FMDV serotypes has been developed and evaluated on tongue epithelium and cell culture samples. real-time PCR has engendered wider acceptance of PCR due to its improved rapidity and sensitivity. there are currently five main chemistries used for the detection of PCR product during real-time PCR. these are the 5\u2032 endonuclease, adjacent linear and hairpin oligoprobes, and the self-fluorescing amplicons. real-time PCR has been developed to detect the nucleic acid. this is most sensitive and rapid method to detect the nucleic acid. the viral RNA can be consistently detected over a seven log range. the test can be performed in 2 hours or less on a portable instrument. real-time PCR assays for FMDV have also been automated using robots for nucleic acid extraction and liquid handling equipment. the assay has also been applied for FMDV and it is capable of detecting all seven serotypes [39, 161, 169\u2013177]. real-time PCR technology is rapidly replacing conventional PCR and other established diagnostic methods such as antigen-ELISA and cell culture isolation. real-time PCR is rapidly replacing conventional PCR and other established diagnostic methods such as antigen-ELISA and cell culture isolation. a number of antigenic non-structural proteins (NSPs) of FMD were identified and out of which 3ABC gene appears to be the most reliable marker of FMD virus replication. a mutant FMDV with deletion of immunodominant epitopes was evaluated to use as a marker vaccine recently. the rvAs-3A14D was rescued from BHK-21 cells. the infectivity, antigenecity, and replication kinetics were similar to that of its parent virus. virulence in mice of the rvAs-3A14D were similar to that of its parent virus. the application of the marker vaccine may open a promising new avenue for the development of a vaccine for DIVA. a set of forward primers and one reverse primer were also designed to allow amplification of approximately 1100 bp of target sequences from this region. a total of 23 different FMDV strains representing all seven serotypes were detected and typed by the FMD DNA chip. microarray technology offers a unique capability to identify multiple pathogens in a single chip. recombinant -galactosidases accommodating one or two different peptides from the FMDV NS protein 3B per enzyme monomer can be reactivated by anti-3B monoclonal antibodies. these recombinant -galactosidases could be also efficiently reactivated by sera from infected animals that permitted differentiation between sera from infected animals. phage display technology was used to produce bovine anti-FMDV Fabs. phages displaying the consensus motif ETTXLE (X is any amino acid (aa)) are highly homologous to 6ETTLLE11 at the N-terminus of the VP2 protein (structural protein) of the FMDV. the technique allows rapid diagnosis, allowing time for early implementation of control measures to reduce the possibility of spread of FMD. the detection of FMDV antigens by direct application of vesicular fluids and epithelial suspensions from animals of an infected farm may reduce the chances of diagnostic error arising from nonspecific reactions. such pen-side diagnosis would have particular benefits in FMD emergencies. relevance to FMD control programmes which operate in endemic regions. a pen-side device for diagnosis would reduce the need for routine diagnostic samples to an FMD laboratory."}
