{"summary": "the formation of the ILVs within the MVB and the budding of enveloped virions share many features. evolutionarily unrelated viruses, with dramatically different genomes, have converged in their use of the host machinery for ILV formation to promote their own budding. apoptotic cells shed large vesicles of about 500\u20132000 nm in diameter. exosomes, 30\u2013100 nm in diameter, are initially formed as ILVs inside the MVB. exosomes are conserved structures formed in every cell type [10]. exosomes are being investigated as a source of novel biomarkers. in recent years, a plethora of reports and reviews has explored several functions of exosomes in mediating intercellular communication, immune system functions, development and differentiation, neuronal function, cell signaling, regeneration. viruses such as IAV, RSV, Sendai virus (SeV) and Andes virus (ANDV) were shown to hijack Rab11 vesicles to transport their progeny RNA to the cell surface. human herpes 6 (HHV-6) virions were shown to be secreted upon fusion of MVB with the plasma membrane, together with exosomes. no underlying mechanism has yet been reported to differentiate MVB formation for degradation or fusion with the cell membrane. there are reports suggesting existence of subpopulations of MVBs, depending on their fate. exosomes are enriched in components such as lipids, RNAs, and proteins. exosomes are enriched in components such as lipids, RNAs, and proteins. cytokines, tetraspanins, major histocompability complex, Rabs, SNARES, and flotillin. ubiquitin- and ESCRT-independent pathways are the best characterized. the sphingomyelinase pathway catalyzes ceramide synthesis [56], or phospholipase D2 and ADP rybosylation factor-6-mediated ILV budding. Rab5-containing endosomes sort material to ILV, decrease pH, and acquire hydrolytic proteases able to degrade their internal contents [67] vesicles might acquire Rab9 to enter retrograde transport to the TGN [66], or instead acquire Rab27a/b and fuse with plasma membrane-releasing exosomes. oligodendroglial cancer and primary cells to analyze phospholipase D2-containing exosomes have been found to facilitate the release of the exosomal markers MHC II, CD63, and CD81 in many cancer types. Rab27 did not influence the release of Wingless in Drosophila S2 cells [71] and Rab27 did not affect the extracellular levels of flotillin or of anthrax toxin in retinal epithelial cells [70] the status of Rab11 required for the virus association is provided as activated (GTP-bound) or inactivated (GDP-bound) references where alterations in exosome biogenesis were identified are provided, if available. the orthomyxovirus IAV, the Paramyxoviruses SeV and RSV, and the Bunyavirus ANDV all share negative strand RNA genomes. vRNP hijacking occurs via activated (GTP-bound) Rab11a [73,77,78,79,80,81,82] in uninfected cells. 11 pathway \u201cslows down\u201d recycling efficiency. it could be used to assess effects of impairing Rab11 in exosome biogenesis. the effects in recycling efficiency might differ for RSV. HIV also uses the ESCRT pathway to facilitate budding [3]. this viral interference with many different steps of MVB/exosome formation suggests a high dependency on the host ILV machinery. how different Rabs regulate particular steps in the life cycle of specific viruses remains to be evaluated. phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) was recruited by Flavivirus and Picornavirus to sites near the endoplasmic reticulum. such enrichment was shown to be mediated by specific phoshoinositide (PI) kinases [100,101], one of them able to recruit Rab11 to the Golgi [102]. ARFs and ARLs are involved in early steps of vesicular biogenesis. vesicle scission and release are mediated by highly specialized proteins that recognize, encircle, and cut the membrane neck. other factors that control Rab delivery to specific membranes include proteins that directly activate/deactivate them. exosomes can transfer functional proteins, lipids, and distinctive sets of RNAs from cell to cell in homeostatic conditions. this machinery could, in principle, contribute to viral spread. first, viral RNA and proteins would need to access ILV. ESCRT component Hrs is critical for release of nucleocapsid [113] and hepatitis A virus. exosomes derived from infected human hepatoma cells containing full-length viral RNA were shown to be infectious and a major route of transmission. the non-enveloped virus HAV has been reported to acquire a host-derived membrane. exosome modulation of immune responses has been explored in some detail. exosomes can be found in bodily fluids (reviewed in [119,120,121]. exosomes can be found in bodily fluids (reviewed in [119,120,121]) exosomes secreted by nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells also contained high amounts of the immunoregulator protein galectin-9. exosomes are internalized by DC where they downregulate specific immunoregulatory genes. exosomes exert a stimulatory effect on non-infected B lymphocytes. this was illustrated with the identification of important innate immune effectors. manipulation of microenvironment Viral infection is thought to be responsible for 10% to 15% of all human cancers. seven human tumor viruses have been identified, including human papillomavirus (HPV), Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), HCV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) ERK and PI3K/Akt are renowned factors able to promote cell growth and migration. a specific miRNA composition has been found in tumor viruses\u2019 derived exosomes. exosomal miRNA compositions were dependent on the expression of the viral oncogene E6/E7. exosomes can transfer functional proteins, lipids, and distinctive sets of RNAs from cell to cell in homeostatic conditions. in the last decades, exosomes were also shown to facilitate cell-to-cell transport of disease-related proteins involved in neurodegenerative disorders. this machinery could, in principle, contribute to viral spread. component Hrs is critical for release of nucleocapsid [113] and hepatitis A virus (HAV) exosomes derived from infected human hepatoma cells containing full-length viral RNA were shown to be infectious and a major route of transmission. the non-enveloped virus HAV acquired a host-derived membrane for cell-to-cell transmission. exosomes release vesicles with immune modulatory properties. exosomes can be found in bodily fluids (reviewed in [119,120,121]) exosomes can be found in bodily fluids. exosomes secreted by nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells also contained high amounts of the immunoregulator protein galectin-9, which is able to induce apoptosis of EBV-specific CD4+ T cells. exosomes released from EBV-infected B lymphocytes exert a stimulatory effect on non-infected B lymphocytes, driving their proliferation, class-switch recombination, and differentiation into plasmablast- manipulation of microenvironment Viral infection is thought to be responsible for 10% to 15% of all human cancers. seven human tumor viruses have been identified, including human papillomavirus (HPV), Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), HCV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) ERK and PI3K/Akt are renowned factors able to promote cell growth and migration. a specific miRNA composition has been found in tumor viruses\u2019 derived exosomes [38,48,113,134,138,139,140,141,142] infected with tumorigenic HPV, the miRNA content was enriched for species controlling cell proliferation, senescence, and apoptosis. there are four areas that need detailed investigation. the next challenge is to better understand how each virus modifies distinct endocytic compartments. the inclusion of viral proteins and RNAs in exosomes offers a unique system to identify signals and sorting mechanisms into ILVs. exosomal fractions will facilitate the understanding of their role in infection, namely in immune activation, viral spread, and persistence."}
