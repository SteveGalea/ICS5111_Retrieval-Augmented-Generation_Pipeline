{"summary": "the national bio and agro defense facility (NBAF) is a balancing act with tradeoffs that can be staggering varying in outcomes and economic value. this study considers a timely and relevant case, food-and-mouth-disease, in one such facility. the current study is unique as it examines unintentional, hypothetical releases of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDv) from an animal research facility. this set of releases provides a nearly complete coverage of the feasible risk space, providing a broad landscape over which release events could translate into a range of economic consequences. a concern is that in the event of large outbreaks killing all infected animals may not be feasible. we are able to examine the impacts of FMDv releases over time and across commodities along the supply chain. between 1940 and 2004, 60% of emerging infectious diseases in the united states were zoonotic, a disease that is transmissible between animals and humans. the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in eastasia and canada resulted in estimated losses of $40 to $50 billion. in the 2001 FMD outbreak in the UK, over six million animals were culled with estimated losses of $10 billion to $12 billion. a modern biocontainment laboratory that is capable of conducting research and developing vaccines against such diseases is required. the department of homeland security has noted that PIADC is at the end of its lifecycle and is too small to meet the nation's research needs. it is the intent that NBAF will replace and enhance current research at PIADC; (2) enhance research capabilities diagnosing foreign animal, emerging and zoonotic diseases. initial risk assessment completed in 2010 was used in altering the design of NBAF and changing the standard operating procedures, personnel training, and emergency response planning. following the updated risk assessment, the design of NBAF was modified to conform to nuclear regulatory standards and withstand with up to 228 miles per hour [16]. d is subclinically infectious) or relational function. the parameters are developed through literature searches, research, and expert opinions. NAADSM is simulated 200 times for each scenario to generate a distribution of disease spread outcomes. the percent changes in endogenous variables are then applied to a baseline defined by the observed data for the first quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter of 2018 of no-disease. this results in estimated changes in per capita consumer welfare and changes in quasi-profits and captured by returns to capital and management. the indirect effects to tourism were more than 20 times larger when compared to the indirect effects to agriculture. RIMSII integrates the input and output relationships of approximately 500 industries and regional economic accounts. the final-demand multipliers for output are used to estimate the indirect economic activity generated by a specific economic activity in a region. MSII data separates the economic effects of various forms of travel. expenditures are allocated by category for each state in the study region. travel and tourism are not a dominant sector in the region. the non-indemnification costs per animal are consistent in magnitude with those reported by Abdalla et al. no federal vaccination policy for FMD exists in the u.s. and no definitive precedent was uncovered in previous studies. for outbreaks 180 days, the vaccinate-to-kill scenario is assumed where all vaccinated animals are assumed to be culled. 6 608 p50/p50 424 V2L 2,707,326 53,592 81,606 2,012,587 12,884 p50/p95 473 V2L 5,864,177 140,795 399,528 6,376,951 119,768 p95/p5 335 V2L 3,548,413 0 0 2,504,141 0 p95/p50 492 V2L 10,333,905 2K 207,849 793 224 10,252 5 p5/p50 48 V2K 283,757 838 224 11,910 5 p5/p95 420 V2L 811,038 13,413 14,663 89,342 5,798 p50/p5 266 V2L 3,417,986 0 0 2,596,428 0 p50/p50 424 V2L 3,417,986 1,158 0 2,416,037 0 p95/p50 492 V2L 4,217,057 80,383 82,913 9,253,821 9,760 p95/p95 533 V2L 9,574,132 238,228 713,783 10,055,838 12,974 *V2K is vaccinated-to-kill, V2L is vaccinated-to-live. 235,676 53,852 921,923 64,157 p50/p5 177,582 364,830 16,911 451,631 24,521 p50/p50 2,960,231 5,099,550 515,408 22,353,735 411,781 p50/p95 4,941,577 14,733,683 875,965 25,788,110 1,148,413 p95/p5 7,288,96 domestic demand shocks represent the share of the population decreasing consumption of a final good. domestic demand shocks represent the share of the population decreasing consumption of a final good. the impacts are small and short lived, but the likelihood of. consumers in the UK decreased their average weekly per capita carcass meat consumption from 235 grams in 2001 to 229 grams in 2002 (or 2.7% decline) domestic demand shocks are specified for FMD across the scenarios. following an FMD outbreak lasting less than one quarter, it was assumed that 5% of people would refrain from consuming beef, pork, and lamb. a review of literature is useful in identifying plausible time lengths defining trade bans for our FMD scenarios. the EU imposed a one year ban on the UK following its 2001 FMD outbreak. a review of previous literature is useful in identifying plausible time lengths defining trade bans for our FMD scenarios. full recovery is assumed to occur in approximately two years following one full quarter after the outbreak is eradicated. in 2009, cattle and calves are the most valuable agricultural commodity in four states in the study. production types used in NAADSM are adjusted to allow for use in the partial equilibrium economic model. the production types required by the partial equilibrium economic model are beef cattle, dairy, slaughter cattle, swine and sheep. the production types required by the partial equilibrium economic model are beef cattle, slaughter cattle, dairy, slaughter cattle, swine and sheep. there are multiple mechanisms and pathways in which a pathogen might be released from a containment laboratory. these pathways include liquid (e.g., through a drain), solid waste (e.g., carcass disposal system), fomite and vectors (e.g., clothing, mosquito), and aerosol (e.g., air filtration system). the probable cause of the outbreak was due to leaking drainage pipes at the Institute for Animal Health, a zoonotic disease research laboratory. Enhanced Fujita 4 tornado touched down on the campus of basketballF. each release scenario has different probabilities, amount of FMDv released, and means by which the virus is transported in the environment. the first three events represent unannounced events while the latter represents an announced event. the parameters are developed through literature searches, research, and expert opinions. NAADSM is simulated 200 times for each scenario to generate a distribution of disease spread outcomes. this study includes all possible starting locations for each release scenario. the economic model then solves for the percent changes in the endogenous variables (prices and quantities) for each quarter. this results in estimated changes in per capita consumer welfare and quasi-profits and captured by returns to capital and management. indirect effects to tourism were more than 20 times larger when compared to indirect effects to agriculture. RIMSII integrates input and output relationships of approximately 500 U.S. industries and regional economic accounts. RIMSII data separates the economic effects of various forms of travel. expenditures are allocated by category for each state in the study region. travel and tourism are more important in the region. partial equilibrium model includes major agricultural sectors along vertical and horizontal market chains beginning with livestock and grain production. shocks resulting from an FMD outbreak are incorporated into the model as percentage changes from the baseline. the economic model then solves for the percent changes in endogenous variables (prices and quantities) for each quarter. the direct losses of tourism following the 2001 UK FMD outbreak were equal to the losses to the agricultural sector, excluding the producer compensation from the government. the indirect effects to tourism were more than 20 times larger when compared to the indirect effects to agriculture. the economic impact from the loss in travel expenditures can be measured using RIMSII [36]. total domestic travel expenditures for overnight trips and day trips of over 50 miles in 2007 were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau by state. government costs include appraisal, cleaning and disinfection, disposal, euthanasia, indemnification, quarantine, surveillance, and vaccination. indemnification payments reflect the value of culled animals at average market prices in the first quarter of 2009 prior to an FMDv release. exogenous Shocks An FMD outbreak would result in shocks to production, domestic demand, and international trade [5, 7, 22]. Production (Supply) Shock Output from the disease spread model is used to estimate the production or supply shocks. the number of animals culled by production type, by quarter is used to calculate the percentage reduction in supply. sheep Liquid Waste p5/p5 0 V2K 0 0 0 0 p5/p50 0 V2K 0 0 0 p5/p95 15 V2K 21,640 25 0 0 0 0 p50/p5 78 V2K 1,093,786 5,667 6,507 105,646 608 p50/p50 424 V2L 2,707,326 53,59 154,198 758,512 13,547,509 111,235 p95/p50 492 V2L 10,357,307 276,457 837,208 14,633,068 73,298 p95/p95 533 V2L 12,354,311 338,167 1,161,410 13,453,333 72,937 Transference p5/p5 35 V2K 207,849 793 224 10,252 5p5/ V2L 3,379,717 0 0 2,759,748 0 p50/p50 424 V2L 3,755,606 147 504 2,599,759 0 p50/p95 473 V2L 8,512,799 101,207 375,891 8,396,696 116,893 p95/p5 333 V2L 3,582,124 1,158 0 2,416,037 0 p95/ 414 p95/p95 7,911,697 21,792,460 1,650,836 31,526,353 2,148,883 Aerosol p5/p5 5,048 30,848 1,104 3,672 1,492 p5/p50 115,651 134,906 25,423 731,283 9,009 p5/p50 115,651 134,906 25,423 731,283 9,009 p5/p 425,357 p95/p5 7,026,349 15,253,943 1,298,846 30,119,740 1,546,958 p95/p50 8,236,661 18,135,449 1,599,610 27,766,499 1,806,057 p95/p95 7,865,919 21,867,560 1,568,794 31,672,812 2,137,911 Tornado p5/p5 581,040 2,56 studies have quantified the impact of consumer demand in the united states to livestock and meat disease outbreaks. the impacts are small and short lived, but the likelihood of larger responses coincided with larger outbreaks/recalls. there have been FMD outbreaks experienced in other countries, including the UK in 2001. the magnitude and duration of trade shocks assumed in this study are based on observations from previous events in the world, including the united states. in 2003 and 2004, the U.S. and Canada faced complete bans on beef in major overseas markets. beef exports, as a percentage of beef production was 9.5% in 2003, dropped dramatically to 1.9% in 2004 and recovered to 7.4% in 2008. the interruption of exports for one quarter beyond the end of the outbreak is consistent with the world organization for animal health (OIE) guidelines and practices. after the additional quarter ended with no FMD reported, it is assumed gradual recovery of U.S. exports will occur until it reaches the baseline levels. and/or animals vaccinated listed in Table 3 and Table 4 are used in calculating the production shock, respectively.

impacts are small and short lived, but the likelihood of larger responses coincided with larger outbreaks/recalls. domestic demand shocks are specified for FMD across the scenarios. domestic consumer demand would decrease by 5% for one quarter and 2.5% for another quarter for beef, pork, and lamb. consumer demand for dairy and milk products would decline by 2.5% for one quarter following the outbreak. 95% of all exports of beef, pork, lamb meat, cattle, swine, and sheep are halted during the full quarter of the outbreak. for one quarter after the last case appears, some processed/cooked beef is still exported after the outbreak. gradual recovery of U.S. exports will occur until it reaches baseline levels. this study contains one of the largest, if not the largest, number of susceptible animals/herds of any FMD economic modeling study. the exact farm locations are not available in the united states. location data typically exists for medium and large sized operations. the production types used in NAADSM are beef cattle, slaughter cattle, dairy, swine and sheep. the production types required by the partial equilibrium economic model are beef cattle, slaughter cattle, dairy, swine and sheep. a pathogen may be released from a containment laboratory. an air leak in a gasket around a research laboratory door was the cause of in an internal release of FMDv at PIADC [2]. this scenario represents the virus accidentally released through an aerosol. 42 tornados, on average, are reported with 120 nautical miles of NBAF each year. additional consequences are reported for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of outbreaks based on animals culled. this provides a range of consequences that may arise from an FMD outbreak. in the aerosol, liquid waste, and transference release events, there are 10 scenarios in which the outbreak lasted less than 2 quarters. the number of animals culled and length of the outbreak for the 95th percentile of epidemiological output scenario was 20.6 million head and 533 days. the impacts at the 5th percentile were larger due to the initial spread of the virus by the tornado. the numbers of livestock vaccinated follow a similar pattern as duration and number of animals culled. management were a decline of $19,920 million while changes in consumer welfare increased by $3,489 million. the positive effect on consumers was a result of a small production shock, small adverse reactions from consumers, and trade sanctions. producers and consumer impacts for P50/P5 are similar in size to P5/P95 while the remaining distribution of epidemiological and starting location impacts range from $47,578 to $64,027 million. 4,152 -$136,331 p95/p5 -$47,578 -$43,436 $2,322 $771 -$831 -$94,938 p95/p50 -$61,231 -$58,915

from $0 to $15,448 million. the beef cattle sector returns to capital and management has rebounded to the pre-outbreak levels. the swine sector\u2019s recovery to pre-disease outbreak levels occurs approximately four quarters later (the 9th quarter) this result is mostly due to the amount of exports lost by both sectors. both the meat processing and crops sectors producer returns do not fully recover to pre-disease levels by the 40th quarter. the remaining sectors (eggs and layers, dairy cattle and milk, lambs and sheep, and soybean processing) are positive or negative, but they are very small. government indemnification costs range from $30 million for the P5/P5 scenario to $9,850 million for the P95/P95 scenario. non-indemnification costs are smaller with a range of $6 million to $5,600 million. impacts to regional non-agricultural sectors are declining of $50 million to $4,645 million across the scenarios. the total economic impacts range from losses of $76,426 million to $137,565 million. producers lose along the entire distribution of outcomes. however, consumers do not gain in any at any point along the distribution. there are 10 scenarios in which the outbreak lasted less than 2 quarters. the number of animals culled generally was less than 1.2 million head. the remaining scenarios were a vaccinate-to-live policy. the fewest vaccines are 0 in the Liquid Waste release event for P5/P5. the P95/P95 scenario for the Transference release scenario results in over 65 million vaccinations. the negative impacts to consumers were a result of a small production shock, small adverse reactions from consumers, and trade sanctions.
