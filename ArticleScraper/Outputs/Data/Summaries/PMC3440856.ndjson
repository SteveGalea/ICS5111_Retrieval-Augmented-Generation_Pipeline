{"summary": "systemic inflammation participates in atherosclerosis evolution from early development of endothelial dysfunction to formation of mature atheromatic plaques. inflammatory cells, involving activated neutrophils, are more frequently found in plaques vulnerable to rupture [3] neutrophil activation has been reported in unstable angina (UA) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) but not in patients with stable angina (SA) [4\u201310], therefore biomarkers of neutrophil activation could be study hypothesized that levels NGAL in blood may reflect the extent of neutrophil activation in various stages of ACS and could discriminate various types of ACS (UA, NSTEMI, and STEMI) and stable from unstable coronary syndromes. 2 cardiologists blinded to NGAL results reviewed all patients available records at the completion of their hospital stay. the SA group consisted of patients with angiographically documented organic coronary stenosis >70% by quantitative coronary angiography in major arteries who had chronic symptoms of angina or a positive SPECT test. our troponin-I assay fulfills imprecision criteria for concentration >0.2 ng/mL. in all ACS patients PCI was performed within 24 hours from admission. samples were collected from all healthy subjects in the morning and before training. multiple-comparison procedures (Dunn's method) for comparisons between groups. the Friedman test and Wilcoxon test with the Bonferroni correction. a P value of less than 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered to indicate statistical significance. twenty (20) healthy amateur athletes without risk factors served as control group. ten patients were excluded for malignant diseases (n = 1), active infections (n = 3), and end stage renal disease (n = 3) recent surgery (n = 3). also 20 patients with negative coronary angiography were excluded. angiographically documented organic coronary stenosis >70% by quantitative coronary angiography in major arteries. UA was diagnosed in patients with typical angina at rest, or a sudden increase in episodes of a previously stable angina. serum-NGAL was measured with an ELISA (Bioporto, Gentofte, Denmark). normal distributions for quantitative data were tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test. for normally distributed parameters data were presented as means + standard deviation. smoking habits did not differ significantly in the first three patients while it was significantly higher in group 4. the differences we observed in the median serum-NGAL values among the 4 patient groups and the healthy controls were significant. ng/mL 79.23 (37.50\u2013100.32) 108.00 (68.34\u2013177.59) 166.49 (109.24\u2013247.20) 178.63 (111.18\u2013305.92) 50.31 (44.30\u201369.78) s-Creatinine, mean (SD) mol/L 79.72 (16.94) 79.86 (17.78) 86.04 (21.74) 88.65 (3 there is a linear and positive correlation between serum-NGAL and hs-CRP. there was a positive and significant correlation between serum-NGAL and hs-CRP. differences that were observed among the four patient groups in WBC and PMN counts were statistically significant. negative predictive value of this cutoff is high (97.28%) the diagnostic value for serum-NGAL in discriminating ACS patients, from patients with SA is high (AUC = 0.929) and better than of hs-CRP (AUC = 0.794) and PMN count (AUC = 0.830).

NGAL is present in atherosclerotic plaques and in human abdominal aortic aneurisms. the main source of NGAL was found to be neutrophils, probably recruited in the vascular wall by platelet activation. serum levels of NGAL were significantly elevated in patients with angiographically confirmed CAD compared to those with normal arteries or controls. the expression of NGAL from vascular cells during atherogenesis can also explain the differences between patients with no risk factors observed in our study. increased serum NGAL resulting from activation of neutrophils may reflect an acute systemic inflammatory response to events such as stroke, renal failure, or infection. NGAL is also expressed by epithelial cells, renal tubular cells, and hepatocytes during inflammation or injury. serum levels of NGAL increase in patients with CAD with every coronary clinical syndrome. also in patients with ACS, serum levels of NGAL reflect the inflammatory status."}
