{"summary": "avian influenza viruses (AIVs), caused by influenza A viruses, are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family [1]. many reports have described their natural transmission to humans and occasionally to other mammals [2,3] many bacterial diseases were observed with positively AI-infected birds such as mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), mycoplasma synoviae (MS), Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus. the impact of such co-infections on the host responses, which includes viral shedding, sites of virus replication sites, and clinical outcome, was addressed in several studies [12,13,14, the bacterial infection, mediating the proteolytic activation of AIV, has been well documented. the exact mechanism is still not well known. four proposed mechanisms could illustrate the role of bacterial coinfection. co-infected flocks revealed lower or undetectable virus titers. co-infection usually occurs, but due to confusing similar clinical signs it cannot be easily diagnosed. most of the viral-viral or viral-bacterial interference studies do not reflect the field situation in which poultry are exposed to more than one infectious and/or non-infectious agent. chickens previously inoculated with one of the Israeli LPAIV H9N2 genotype G1 could show up to 100% survival after inoculation with the lethal HPAIV H5N1 virus. previous infection, not vaccination with LPAIV, modulates the course of subsequent infection with the Egyptian HPAIV H5N1. IBV infection may provide this enzyme and enhanced LPAIV H9N2 pathogenicity in chickens. the literature on coinfections of AI virus with IB virus is sparse on co-infection with IB vaccine or IB field stain 4/91. chickens co-infected simultaneously with LPAIV H9N2 (A/Chicken/Iran/SH110/99) and IBV (IBV/4/91) reported severe clinical signs (respiratory distress, facial edema, conjunctivitis, depression, lacrimation, ruffled feathers, whitish watery diarrhea, and nasal discharge which continued until eight days post-infection) a significantly higher HI titer against AIV infection frquent co-infections/interferences were reported in many areas of the world. lentogenic NDV with either LPAIV or HPAIV and velogenic NDV with either LPAIV or HPAIV can replicate in the upper respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells by binding to the sialic acid-containing receptors. chickens infected with the less virulent mesogenic NDV prior to HPAIV revealed reduced HPAIV replication and increased survival rates. vNDV with Either a LPAIV or a HPAIV in Duck Co-infection decreased the number of birds shedding vNDV. ducks simultaneously infected with vNDV and HPAI survived fewer days compared to those that received the vNDV two days prior to the HPAIV infection. reduced transmission of vNDV to nave contact ducks was reported. this confirms that infection with one virus can interfere with replication of another virus. reassortment can emerge when two different AIV subtypes co-infect the same cell at the same time. infected chickens shed HPAIV H5N1 in their feces (higher levels) and trachea (lower level), while the signs of the co-infected chickens were usually mild. IBV is considered one of the most economically important respiratory viral diseases. it threatens the poultry industry, along with the HPAIV and velogenic Newcastle disease virus (vvNDV) chickens co-infected simultaneously with LPAIV H9N2 and IBV (IBV/4/91) reported severe clinical signs (respiratory distress, facial edema, conjunctivitis, depression, lacrimation, ruffled feathers, whitish watery diarrhea, and nasal discharge. a significantly higher HI titer against AIV infection was noticed in the co-infected group, which may influence the diagnosis process. the IBV vaccine is used extensively in chicken farms in many countries where both IBV and LPAIV H9N2 are endemic. an experimental study with LPAIV H9N2 and an IBV live vaccine (H120 strain) was conducted concerning clinical signs, gross lesions, viral shedding, and mortality. the interference between LPAIV H9N2 and the IBV live vaccine increased the severity of LPAIV H9N2 clinical signs. a significantly higher HI titer against AIV infection was observed in the co-infected group. the findings showed that IBV co-infection enhanced LPAIV H9N2 pathogenicity through protease enzymes. the virus is a member of the genus Avulavirus in the paramyxoviridae family. velogenic NDV with either LPAIV or HPAIV can replicate in the upper respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells by binding to the sialic acid-containing receptors on the cell surface. virus replication may also be affected by the previous replication of another virus in the same site through the active antiviral immune responses. the death of all birds was recorded within 1.9 to 5.2 days with no difference in the clinical signs between the single infected or co-infected group in high dose of vNDV. chickens infected with the less virulent mesogenic NDV prior to HPAIV revealed reduced HPAIV replication and increased survival rates. lNDV and LPAIV in Duck An experimental study was carried out to investigate the effect of coinfection with lNDV and LPAIV. co-infection revealed less productive lNDV shedding and higher LPAIV shedding in cloaca swabs. the death of all birds was recorded within 1.9 to 5.2 days with no difference in the clinical signs between the single infected or co-infected group in high dose of vNDV. chickens infected with the less virulent mesogenic NDV prior to HPAIV (with a lower dose) revealed reduced HPAIV replication and increased survival rates. infection with one virus can interfere with replication of another virus, affecting its pathogenesis and transmission. co-infection revealed less productive lNDV shedding and higher LPAIV shedding in cloaca swabs. staphylococcus sp. produces soluble proteases that are able to activate the HA of AIVs. indirect activation of the HA could occur by staphylokinase that could activate chicken plasminogen into plasmin. pigeon, rook, duck, ostrich, goose, guinea fowl, turkey, chicken, red-legged partridge, and falcon cause airsacculitis and pneumonia. pathogenicity of the ORT depends on the route of inoculation, virulence of the strain, environmental factors, the immune status of the host, and the presence of the concurrent infection. Avian Influenza Coinfection with Avian Mycoplasmosis Mycoplasmas are prokaryote that are characterized by its very small size, absence of cell wall, small genome, and being surrounded by plasma membrane. some mycoplasma species are able to penetrate the host cells as Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS), and these two species are also able to hemagglutinate chickens and turkeys\u2019 the longer time of incubation with MG before the LPAIV H9N2 challenge enhanced ciliostasis. incubation with MG for 24 h followed by a LPAIV H9N2 infection promotes both viral and bacterial replications. this could be attributed to MG-inducing destruction of cilia and hyperplesia of epithelial cells. pre-infection of chickens with LPAIV H9N2 and secondary inoculation with E. coli was reported to induce significantly higher AIV antibodies 2 weeks post-infection (wpi) in the pre-infected group, a prolonged virus shedding up to 14 dpi was observed as compared to only 7 dpi in the group inoculated with H9N2 alone. staphylococcus sp. produces soluble proteases that activate the HA of AIVs. indirect activation of the HA could occur by staphylokinase that could activate chicken plasminogen into plasmin. pheasant, pigeon, rook, duck, ostrich, goose, guinea fowl, turkey, chicken, red-legged partridge, and falcon. pathogenicity of the ORT depends on the route of inoculation, virulence of the strain, environmental factors, the immune status of the host, and the presence of the concurrent infection.

NDV lNDV (LaSota) Co-infection with LPAIV-H9N2 (A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL/08) in chickens showed a significant reduction in virus replication and virus shedding compared to singly inoculated chickens. further significantly higher titer for LPAIV and lower for lNDV was detected in oropharangeal and cloacal swabs. co-infection with LPAIV (A/Mallard/OH/421/1987 (H7N8) caused no clinical signs in ducks. but co-infection decreased the number of birds shedding vNDV. it did not affect the number of ducks shedding LPAIV. chickens pre-infected with MG aerosol exhibit clinical signs, pathological lesions along the entire respiratory system. the longer time incubation with MG before LPAIV H9N2 challenge the more enhancement of ciliostasis and significant down regulation of antiviral innate immune response. chickens pre-infected with LPAIV H9N2 then inoculated with 1.6 109 cfu/ birds of E. Coli intrathoracic showed significant early mortality with more predominant clinical signs (conjunctivitis, diarrhea, ocular exudates and rales) compared to groups that received lower E. coli count."}
