{"summary": "chronic paralysis is an infectious and contagious disease of adult honeybees. it is known to induce a cluster of clinical signs, such as trembling and flightless bees crawling at the hive entrance. the viral particle is anisometric and non-enveloped, its size being about 30\u201360 nm in length and 20 nm in width. a phylogenetic study shows that CBPV seems to occupy an intermediate position between families Nodaviridae and Tombusviridae. the amino acid sequence of ORF 2 and 3 on RNA 2 yield two proteins with predicted molecular masses of about 65.5 kDa and 19.7 kDa respectively. the molecular mass of the 20 kDa protein is similar to the single capsid protein of about 23.5 kDa proposed by Bailey [6 pSP could be membrane-associated protein with 3 or 4 transmembrane segments. hSP could be a virion glycoprotein with two transmembrane segments. characterization from virus particles requires pure viral particle preparation, protein denaturation, electrophoretic separation and identification of proteins. we describe the first proteomic analysis of CBPV. we examined a CBPV preparation from honeybee heads that was purified on a sucrose gradient, followed by SDS-Page separation and nano-HPLC coupled to a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight. a sample of purified CBPV particles was negatively stained to be examined under a transmission electron microscope. the purified virus was quantified using real time RT-PCR [16,17] and the absence of other honeybee RNA viruses genomes. gel pieces were reswelled in 50 L of 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer containing 12.5 ng/L trypsin. the solution was removed and replaced by 50 L of 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer. after trypsin digestion, the solution was transferred to an eppendorf tube. tryptic peptides were isolated by extraction with (1) 50 L of 1% formic acid (FA) in water (v/v) and peptide separation was performed on a 75 m i.d. 150 mm (3 m, 100, DIONEX, LC Packings) at a flow rate of 200 nL/min. the solvent systems were: (A) 100% water, 0.05% TFA; (B) 100% ACN, 0.04% TFA. all raw data were transferred to ProteinPilot software. proteins from the CBPV purification were separated on a 12% SDS-Page gel. membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat-dry milk in TBST. computer-Assisted Sequence Analysis Putative amino acid sequences of pSP (GI: 188572677) and hSP (GI: 188572676) were used to generate the GRAVY score value with ProtParam [24] and hydrophobicity plots with the algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle [25] using PROTSCALE [26]. the downstream stem-loop structures of ATG codons were predicted with about 100 nucleotides starting from the A a sample of purified CBPV particles was negatively stained to be examined under a transmission electron microscope. the purified virus was quantified using real time RT-PCR [16,17] and the absence of other honeybee RNA viruses genomes. gel pieces were reswelled in 50 L of 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer containing 12.5 ng/L trypsin. the solution was removed and replaced by 50 L of 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer. after trypsin digestion, the solution was transferred to an eppendorf tube. peptide separation was performed on a 75 m i.d. 150 mm (3 m, 100, DIONEX, LC Packings) at a flow rate of 200 nL/min. the solvent systems were: (A) 100% water, 0.05% TFA; (B) 100% ACN, 0.04% TFA. series Explorer allows for an automatic selection of peptide masses for subsequent MS/MS experiments. all raw data were transferred to ProteinPilot software (Applied Biosystems, MDS Analytical Technologies) and protein identification was processed using the ParagonTM algorithm. the signal was detected with an alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad) computer-Assisted Sequence Analysis Putative amino acid sequences of pSP (GI: 188572677) and hSP (GI: 188572676) were used to generate the GRAVY score value with ProtParam [24] and hydrophobicity plots with the algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle [25] using PROTSCALE [26]. the predicted molecular weight of pSP is 19.7 kDa. however, four bands were observed (63, 44, 28 and 18 kDa) we hypothesize that the 18 kDa polypeptide corresponds to pSP. other bands could correspond to different oligomerization states of pSP. es corresponding to pSP and hSP, whereas only pSP peptides were detected in M2 (28 kDa) a band around 60 Da was also analyzed but identified peptides had a confidence value lower than 95%, which is insufficient to confirm the presence of pSP and hSP. pSP and hSP sequences revealed two hydrophobic regions. all identified peptides were outside of these hydrophobic regions. pSP contains an arginine cluster leading to tryptic peptides. hSP peptides were identified on bands between 50 and 68 kDa. this protein seems to be present at its expected molecular weight. however, hSP peptides were also detected in lower bands at about 18 and 44 kDa. HHpred detected sequence similarity between the N-terminal region of pSP (ORF 3, RNA 2) and the N-terminal region of the capsid proteins of several alphanodaviruses. by contrast, no homolog of ORF 2 could be detected using this program. anti-pSP antibodies raised against purified viral particles detected four polypeptides with molecular masses of approximately 60, 43, 29 and 18 kDa. the predicted molecular weight of pSP is 19.7 kDa, but four bands were observed (63, 44, 28 and 18 kDa) M1 (18 kDa) and M3 (44 kDa) contained peptides corresponding to pSP and hSP, whereas only pSP peptides were detected in M2 (28 kDa) a band around 60 Da was also analyzed but identified peptides had a confidence value lower than 95%. pSP and hSP sequences revealed two hydrophobic regions. pSP contains an arginine cluster leading to tryptic peptides that are too small to be analyzed. pSP is composed of 582 amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of 65.5 kDa. hSP peptides were also detected in lower bands at about 18 and 44 kDa. a positive score indicates a hydrophobic protein and a negative score indicates a hydrophilic protein. hSP contains one internal predicted hydrophobic region (residues 200 to 222) and another one at the C-terminus (residues 504 to 560) HHpred detected sequence similarity between the N-terminal region of pSP (ORF 3, RNA 2) and the N-terminal region of the capsid proteins of several alphanodaviruses. no homolog of ORF 2 could be detected using this program. anopheline-associated virus possesses homologs of RNA2 ORF2 and ORF3 but lacks homologs of RNA 2 ORF1 and ORF4. one protein was detected at an apparent mass of 28 kDa, which is about 10 kDa larger than the predicted mass. pSP may be due post-translational modifications, raising its apparent molecular mass by about 10 kDa. this type of processing has been reported in the genera Aphtovirus [36], Enterovirus [37] and Alphanodavirus [38]. a combination of ORF 3 and ORF 2 would yield one fusion capsid protein (p65) this protein would be composed of 580 amino acids containing the whole sequence of pSP and mid-C-terminal region of hSP. the repartition of identified peptides from pSP and hSP could correspond to the location of these peptides on the sequence of p65 at about 65 kDa. the synthesized peptides used for the production of anti-pSP antibodies were located in the N-terminal region of pSP thus corresponding to the N-terminal region of p65. p65 may be cleaved by means of two non-simultaneous cleavage sites (arrowheads) into two proteins of about 45 kD, pSP until mid of p65 and mid-C-terminal region of p65 corresponding to immunodetected protein about 44 kD. the immunodetected protein of about 28 kD may be pSP alone with post-translational modifications. arginine- and lysine-rich motifs (ARM and LRM) have been found in capsid proteins of several insect viruses, such as members of the genus Alphanodavirus, but also in plant viruses. this motif in Bromovirus and Dianthovirus is involved in infection and the cell-to-cell movement. capsid protein alpha of nodamura virus contains ARM. prior entry into cell, protein alpha undergoes cleavage yielding capsid proteins beta and gamma. capsid protein alpha is essential for breaching the host membrane. strategy."}
