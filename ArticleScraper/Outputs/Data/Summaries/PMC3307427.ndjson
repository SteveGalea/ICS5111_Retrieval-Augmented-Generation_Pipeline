{"summary": "study aimed to investigate the presence of Chlamydia spp. in the intestines of growing pigs and in conjunctival swabs from finisher pigs. results By histology, 20 of 48 pigs had intestinal lesions that may be consistent with chlamydial infection. the epidemiology, clinical, and zoonotic importance of these species is however largely unknown [6-8]. in gnotobiotic pig challenge studies, C. suis caused dose-dependent diarrhoea in young piglets. villi atrophy, tip erosions, necrosis, inflammatory changes and lymphangitis were noted. PCR was a reliable, highly sensitive and specific tool for detection of C. suis. sensitivity was 94.4% and specificity 81.0%, whereas the two ELISAs performed considerably weaker. the pigs submitted from the good performance herds had a mean age of 67 days and a mean weight of 23.1 kg. all animals were weaned at approximately 5 weeks of age and none of the pigs had been treated with antibiotics. the pigs originated from several piglet-producing herds. the finisher pigs were snared and sterile cotton swabs were rubbed against the conjunctiva in the left and right eye. the swabs were placed in sterile tubes and transported to the laboratory. DNA from the conjunctival swabs was extracted by phenol/chloroform and precipitated by ethanol. threshold values below Ct 36 were regarded as positive. values between Ct 36 and Ct 38 were regarded as doubtful. difference in detection rate of Chlamydia spp. was analysed. antigen retrieval was performed by heat induced epitope retrieval (TBS-EDTA) in retrieval buffer pH = 9 (TBS-EDTA) slides were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against Chlamydia, clone ACI (Progen Biotechnik Gmbh, Germany) study on growing pigs with diarrhoea originated from major pig producing areas of Sweden. samples included 36 pigs from six herds with poor performance and diarrhoea in growing pigs. 12 pigs from four herds with good performance and no diarrhoea. the control pigs were selected based on clinical signs of moderate to severe conjunctivitis, defined as hyperaemia and chemosis with epiphora and/or muco-purulent secretion. the animals were stunned with electricity, weighed and exsanguinated, and necropsy was immediately performed. multiple negative controls were included and DNA from Cp. abortus and C. suis were used as positive controls. internal amplification control (mimic) was constructed and used as previously described. the predicted PCR product of 600 bp as well as one PCR product of larger and smaller size was purified prior to sequencing by using the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit. the purified products were sequenced with the same primers used in the PCR and by using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) slides were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against Chlamydia. clone ACI (Progen Biotechnik Gmbh, Germany) diluted 1:100. slides were weakly counterstained with haematoxylin. staining included one positive and one negative control section. pigs from the same poor performance herds (casecontrol) were tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC), necropsy, and PCR. the percentage given within brackets is calculated on the actual number of analyses performed in each group. real-time PCR and DNA sequence analysis Of 48 enteric samples analysed, 46 were positive for Chlamydiaceae. the major band of 600 b.p. found in all 19 samples was confirmed as C. suis. the larger PCR product described in the Methods' section was 98-100% identical to Escherichia coli. the two control specimens in which the PCR analyses had been inhibited were graded as + and ++, respectively, by immunohistochemistry. a significant (P 0.05) relationship was detected between the presence of clinical signs and a high degree (++ or +++) of infection. IHC - 1 (7%) 9 (53%) 2 (17%) + 5 (33%) 3 (18%) 7 (58%) ++ 7 (47%) 4 (24%) 3 (25%) +++ 2 (13%) 1 (6%) 0 missing 3 1. the major band of 600 b.p. found in all 19 samples was confirmed as C. suis. larger PCR product was 98-100% identical to Escherichia coli. smaller PCR product did not match any sequence in the BLAST search. a significant (P 0.05) relationship was detected between the presence of clinical signs and a high degree (++ or +++) of infection. no relationship was detected between the presence of clinical signs and the demonstration of chlamydial antigen by immunohistochemistry. in one of the herds in the present study, factors such as emission of ammonium and carbon dioxide gases, air movements and overcrowding were investigated. however, in one stable a high relative humidity (83%) was noted that might facilitate microbial survival. in one stable, a significant relationship was noted between conjunctivitis and the presence of Chlamydia spp. when the lower threshold value was applied in the real-time PCR. this might further indicate that chlamydia suis was found in high prevalences in growing pigs with or without diarrhoea, and in finisher pigs with or without conjunctivitis. no correlation was detected between samples with a high degree of infection and the presence of clinical signs. authors declare that they have no competing interests. FA was responsible for collecting conjunctival swabs, PCR analysis and interpretation of these data. MJ was planning studies, collected and prepared the intestinal specimens. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
