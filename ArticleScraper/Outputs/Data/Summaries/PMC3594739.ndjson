{"summary": "multicellular organisms have developed a set of antimicrobial recognition and defense systems, which enable them to survive. the innate immune system detects molecular structures, denoted as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are distinct from host molecular pattern. these PAMPs are detected using an array of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) [1-3], which are expressed at the first line of defense against infection by cells like macrophages, monocytes, TLR1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are expressed on the cell surface and recognize PAMPs derived from bacteria, fungi and protozoa. TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria. peptidoglycan is sensed by TLR2 [15], which also detects lipoarabinomannan. signaling through TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR6 primarily induces the production of inflammatory cytokines, whereas TLR7 and TLR9 induce type I interferons. many pathogenic organisms synthesize proteases thatresemble host proteases. despite similarities in sequence and structure, cysteine cathepsins differ among each other in specificity. most of the cathepsins are endopeptidases, while cathepsin B and X are also carboxydipeptidases. psin L in the nucleus is regulated by a nuclear cystatin, denoted as stefin B. the regulation of nuclear cathepsin F activity by stefin B in hepatic stellate cells implies the role of stefin B in transcriptional regulation [34]. thyropins are a superfamily of inhibitors homologous to the thyroglobulin type-1 domains. type 3 cystatins are multidomain proteins of high molecular mass (60-120 kDa) cystatins present three tandemly repeated type 2-like cystatin domains. serpins are essentially serine proteinase inhibitors [50,51] only some of them inhibit both serine and cysteine proteases [41] the human genome encodes for two cathepsin L-like proteases, namely the human cathepsin L and cathepsin V. in mouse only cathepsin L is present [29], while cathepsin L is ubiquitously expressed. cathepsins are synthesised as preproproteins, which are activated either by other proteinases or self-activated. psins are homologous to the thyroglobulin type-1 domains. the best characterized human representative so far is the MHC-class II associated invariant chain (Ii) fragment. the tertiary structures of cystatins are conserved and exhibit the so called cystatin fold. the serpins are essentially serine proteinase inhibitors [50,51] only some of them inhibit both serine and cysteine proteases [41] the mechanism by which cysteine proteases are inhibited involves the cleavage of the serpin. macrophages play a critical role in host defense against pathogens. macrophages activated with IFN- and stimulated with IFN- chicken cystatin generated increased amounts of NO and the cytokines TNF- and interleukin 10 (IL-10) macrophages up-regulate a variety of proteinases that can degrade endocytosed pathogens. only some of the endogenous inhibitors (cystatin F and Spia3g) are also up regulated. cystatin C and p41 form of major histocompatibility complex invariant chain did not inhibit cathepsin L. authors suggested that cystatin F might be the inhibitor that selectively regulated cathepsin L activity in macrophages. cytosolic NLR (NLRP1, NLRP2, and NLRP3) are involved in assembly of inflammasome. the NLRP3 can be activated by a number of molecules like crystals silica, asbestos, alum and -amyloid. cytosolic cysteine proteinase inhibitors could regulate cathepsin activity in this process and prevent excessive inflammation. cDCs express low levels of endolysosomal proteases and degrade internalized antigens slowly. resulting limited lysosomal proteolysis in cDCs is favourable to antigen presentation. only cDCs isolated from peripheral blood or derived in vitro from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells are protease poor. the lack of cystatin C did not change the formation of peptide-loaded MHC class II complexes in any of the DC types, nor the efficiency of antigen presentation. pDCs behave differently than conventional DCs in antigen presentation following activation via TLR9 ligands such as CpG DNA. cells derived from cathepsin B, L, K and S deficient mice show no single protease is responsible for TLR7 or TLR9 processing. macrophages play a critical role in host defense against pathogens. they can change their physiology in response to micro-environmental stimuli. chicken cystatin generated increased amounts of NO and the cytokines TNF- and interleukin 10 (IL-10), in comparison with macrophages activated only with IFN-. only some of the endogenous inhibitors (cystatin F and Spia3g) are also up regulated, while cystatin C is down regulated. the authors suggested that cystatin F might be the inhibitor that selectively regulated cathepsin L activity in macrophages. a lack of activity of cathepsin L in classically activated macrophages could be due to different nucleolar localization of cathepsin L and co-localization with Spia3g. cytosolic cysteine proteinase inhibitors could regulate cathepsin activity in this process and prevent excessive inflammation. cytosolic cysteine proteinase inhibitors could regulate cathepsin activity in this process and prevent excessive inflammation. endolysosmal proteases and in vivo degrade internalized antigens slowly. resulting limited lysosomal proteolysis in cDCs is favourable to antigen presentation. cDCs isolated from peripheral blood or derived in vitro from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells are protease poor. the lack of cystatin C did not change the formation of peptide-loaded MHC class II complexes in any of the DC types. pDCs behave differently than conventional DCs in antigen presentation following activation via TLR9 ligands such as CpG DNA. pDCs undergo maturation and present antigens in complex with MHC class II. pathogen-derived proteases range from nonspecific proteases that degrade multiple proteins involved in the immune response to enzymes that are very specific in their mode of action. enzymatically active staphopains degraded collagen and fibrinogen in the host. silico studies revealed the presence of cystatin superfamily representatives in bacterial genomes. only some of them were pathogens of humans (V. cholerae and V. vulnificu) [107] authors suggested that they might inhibit the cysteine proteases of their eukaryotic hosts. the majority of viruses are internalized by endocytosis. in some cases, endolysosomal cysteine cathepsins are required for their transport into the cytosol. infections by the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses cause a fatal haemorrhagic fever in humans and non human primates. a recent study confirmed that GP cleavage by endosomal cathepsins was essential to reveal a putative binding domain for the endolysosomal cholesterol transporter Niemann\u2013Pick C1 (NPC1) [125]. lack of NPC1 on target cells prevented Ebola virus glycoprotein-dependent fusion. several promising vaccines have been tested on nonhuman primates. ACE2 is a cellular receptor for two divergent coronaviruses, SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus NL63. it was reported that the inhibitors of cathepsin L blocked the infection only by SARS, but not by NL63 virus. a combination of antibodies and inhibitors could have several advantages. virions undergo stepwise disassembly in host cell endolysosomes. virions undergo stepwise disassembly, forming discrete intermediates. titers at sites of secondary replication in all strains of cathepsin-deficient mice were lower than those in wild type mice. proteinases and inhibitors used by pathogens interfere with host adaptive and innate immune response. authors confirm that this article content has no conflicts of interest."}
