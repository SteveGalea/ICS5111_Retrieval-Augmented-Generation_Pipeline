{"summary": "METHODS The Dermatological Society of Singapore (DSS) Acne Advisory Board members represent various institutions and the private sector in Singapore. management recommendations were developed based on the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II. references include meta-analyses and current guidelines. a body of scientific evidence comprising studies classified as 1+ that are highly consistent with each other. evidence drawn from a NICE technology appraisal B A body of scientific evidence comprising studies classified as 2++, directly applicable to the target population and highly consistent with each other. 80% consensus of the Advisory Board was required to generate a consensus. these guidelines will be updated every five years. clinicians should assess for signs of hyperandrogenism (i.e., menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and androgenetic alopecia) previous acne treatments and response, as well as specific adverse effects and adherence issues, should be evaluated. obtaining previous treatment history and psychosocial effects data are essential. a low glycemic index (GI) diet is encouraged for patients with acne (Level 2, Grade B) high-GI food (GI>70) results in rapid rise in blood glucose, while low-GI food causes little change. fresh fruit is preferred over juice in the context of a healthy diet. factors that influence GI include amount of soluble fiber (high fiber has lower GI); fat and protein content; type of sugar; type of starch; amount of cooking/processing (i.e., cooking/processing increases GI); food form (e.g., small particle size is more quickly digested and absorbed); and acidity (delays absorption). studies have shown a correlation between chocolate consumption and acne. however, there is generally insufficient evidence supporting the withdrawal of oily or fatty food. the combination therapy of BPO and adapalene is more effective than adapalene or BPO alone. Level 1+, Grade A Combination topical therapy is preferable and more effective than topical antibiotic alone. Level 1+, Grade A Consider alternative antibacterial agents, such as benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or dermocosmetics. retinoid esters (e.g., retinol, retinyl palmitatem, retinyl propionate) also demonstrate the same effects but to a lesser extent. tolerability was lowest among Chinese patients, followed by Indian, Malay, and Caucasian patients. acne.50 maintenance anticomedogenic agents have been shown to effectively control acne and prevent relapses and minimize sequelae. antibiotics do not prevent the development of microcomedones and should not be used for maintenance. antibiotics work by reducing P. acnes levels. inhibition of neutrophil leukotaxis, reduction in cytokine secretion, and decrease in matrix metalloproteinase activity. the characteristics of systemic antibiotics commonly used in acne are seen in Table 7. first-line antibiotics Erythromycin 500\u20131,000mg/day. potential drug interactions with carbamazepine, theophylline, cyclosporine. studies have shown that minocycline is as effective as tetracycline and doxycycline in the quantitative reduction of inflammatory acne. the rationale for recommending minocycline as second-line therapy is based on a systematic review of case reports. long-term use of other systemic antibiotics for acne, such as penicillin and clindamycin, is not favored by the Advisory Board. the current best practice regarding the use of systemic antibiotics is an individualized approach. acceptable high-dose isotretinoin therapy of nodulocystic acne is 120 to 150mg/kg cumulative dose. Level 1+, Grade A For non-nodulocystic or moderate acne, a 0.3 to 0.5mg/kg dose for six months might be sufficient. Level 2+, Grade C Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to systemic isotretinoin. pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to systemic isotretinoin. treatment can be withheld until commencement of the next menstrual period. the causal link between isotretinoin and depression is controversial. relapse rates following systemic isotretinoin treatment can vary between 21 and 30 percent. male sex, age younger than 16 years, residence in urban areas, cumulative oral retinoid dose greater than 2,450mg, and treatment duration longer than 121 days. maintenance with topical retinoids is recommended for at least several months after the cessation of oral isotretinoin. BRAND CONTRACEPTIVE AGENTS CYPROTERONE ACETATE (ANTIANDROGEN) DESOGESTREL DROSPIRENONE (ANTI-ANDROGEN) ETHINYLESTRADIOL LEVONORGESTREL GESTODENE Diane\u201335TM 2mg 35mcg GracialTM 25mcg (blue) 125mcg (white) 40mcg (blue) 30mcg (white) 30mcg a drospirenone COC appeared to be more effective in treating acne than norgestimate or nomegestrol acetate plus 17-estradiol, but less effective than cyproterone acetate. more trials comparing COCs to each other and other acne treatments are needed. contraindications to COCs89 ABSOLUTE CONTRAINDICATIONS RELATIVE CONTRAINDICATIONS \u2022 Lactation less than six weeks postpartum \u2022 Age >35 years and smoking >15 cigarettes/day \u2022 Hypertension. the association of VTE and COCs is known, with an estrogen dose-dependent relationship. in healthy, young women, the risk of ischemic stroke is low, but concomitant COC use and smoking increases the risk significantly. for cervical cancer, there might be an association; however, the association is reduced with cessation of a COC. photodynamic therapy with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid and intense pulsed light (IPL) has been shown to reduce the inflammatory lesion and atrophic scar scores compared to at baseline. 90% of the patients experienced significant or moderate overall improvement. phototherapy at home reduces sebum production, attenuates inflammatory cell infiltrations, and decreases sebaceous gland size. treatment efficacy is due to the antibacterial effect on P. acnes and the ablation of sebaceous glands. studies investigating cosmeceutical products tend to involve a combination of agents, making it difficult to provide a level of evidence for a single agent. only a few cosmeceutical agents are listed and without an assocciated level of evidence. clindamycin 2% and 1% gel for women with mild to moderate acne. Nicotinamide is more effective in oily skin type and clindamycin gel is more effective in non-oily skin types. antimicrobial agents are used alongside topical antibiotics. photoprotection is important especially in those treated with retinoids, oral contraceptives, or postacne hyperpigmentation. oral anti-androgen + topical retinoid/azelaic acid + BPO (Level 1+, Grade A) or oral antibiotics + topical retinoid/azelaic acid + BPO (Level 2+, Grade A) use of COCs in women should take into account higher risks of adverse side effects. adapalene 0.1% gel or cream causes less irritation versus tretinoin. azelaic acid 20% is a mild comedolytic with anti-inflammatory activity. it is safe and effective as a treatment and maintenance option for women with adult acne. treatment recommendations for moderate papulopustular acne include fixed combinations of antibiotics and/or adapalene/BPO and/or topical azelaic acid. treatment recommendations for moderate papulopustular acne include fixed combinations of antibiotics and/or adapalene/BPO. more than 50 percent of individuals in their 30s reported acne, and late onset is more common in women. the majority (93.7%) of women had facial comedones. the majority (93.7%) had facial comedones. treatment of acne in this population requires safety considerations for the mother and fetus/infant. hormonal therapy, tetracyclines, cotrimoxazole, and both oral and topical retinoids should be avoided. topical BPO and adapalene are generally safe. IQ scores reported; embryopathy reported even with single dose; likely not dose-related Excretion in breast milk unknown; use not recommended X Tretinoin Not recommended in pregnancy; avoid particularly in first trimester due to reported teratogenicity Minimal amounts found in breast milk; not thought to be harmful to infants C TABLE 16. grade A Fixed-dose combination topical therapies might be useful in regimens of care for all types and severities of acne Level 1+, Grade A for adolescents, Grade B for preadolescents and younger. grade D Oral antibiotics are appropriate for moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne at any age. patients with acne should be advised accordingly. there is dystrophy of the epidermis and dermis that results in focal skin atrophy. this is in contrast to dyspigmentation due to postinflammation without any skin dystrophy. es, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, hypopigmented macules 2 Mild Mild atrophic/hypertrophic, not obvious at social distance of 50cm away, might be adequately covered Mild rolling, soft papular 3 Moderate Moderate atrophic/hypertrophic, visible at 50cm, not easily covered, can be flattened by stretching skin Deep box car, ice pick, bridges and tunnels. a systematic review comparing AP to NP reported a short-term improvement in acne scars based on both subjective and objective measurements. FP is the current gold standard of laser treatment, due to less downtime. activeFX fractional CO2 laser therapy (Lumenis, San Jose, California, USA) is a new technology for the treatment of facial acne scars, using a diffractive lens array and 755-nm picosecond laser."}
