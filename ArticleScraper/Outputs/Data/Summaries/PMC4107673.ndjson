{"summary": "monocytes circulate in the blood, bone marrow and spleen during homeostasis. these patrolling cells migrate from the blood into the tissues. they produce cytokines to attract monocytes and a constellation of other inflammatory cells, thus establishing the particular inflammatory environment of the tissue. the lack of CD13 leads to compromised reperfusion and muscle regeneration after hindlimb ischaemia due in part to a CD13-dependent reduction in specific myeloid cell subsets. chimeras verified that the CD13 C-terminus determines monocyte/endothelial adhesion and myeloid cell trafficking. this investigation confirms the requirement for CD13 expression for adhesion and trafficking of myeloid cell subsets. mice 6\u20138 weeks of age were injected with 1 ml of 3% TG intraperitoneally. Flow cytometry Cells were isolated from peritoneal lavage, spleen, bone marrow and peripheral blood 48 hr after TG administration. a mouse CD13 forward primer was designed to eliminate the N-terminal half of human CD13. all human, mouse, M/H, H/M constructs/chimera cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA/V5/GW/D-TOPO. quantitative PCR Gr-1hi, Gr-1int and Gr-1lo monocyte populations were sorted by FACS and analysed for CD13 expression. RNA was isolated using Trizol according to manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of splenic myeloid cells Total splenocytes from CD13WT and CD13KO mice were run through a Ficoll-Paque gradient. cells collected from the interface were incubated with anti-CD3/CD19/NK1.1-PE antibodies followed by treatment with PE-conjugated microbeads. images were photographed with an Optronics camera attached to a Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus microscope using a 10, 20, 40 and 63 objective. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired, two-tailed t-test. Flow cytometry was performed on LSRII (Becton Dickinson, Franklyn Lakes, NJ) and the data were analysed with FlowJo software. live/dead cells were negatively gated for T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells and Ly6G+ cells to eliminate lymphocytes, NK cells and neutrophils. high titre virus preparations were obtained using a Phoenix amphotropic cell line (Orbigen, San Diego, CA) for infection of C33a, 50% confluent dish was treated with 10 ml virus stock in the presence of 5 g/ml polybrene. for infection of WEHI 78/24 cells, 1 105 cells were resuspended in 5 ml virus stock in 15 ml conical tube. WEHI 78/24 cells were stained with human CD13 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 452 followed by goat anti-rat Alexa488 and then analysed for human CD13 by flow cytometry. each condition was assayed in triplicate. mCD13 WEHI 78/24 splenic myeloid cells or WEHI 78/24 transfectants were differentially labelled with the fluorescent dyes PKH67 (green) and PKH26 (red) the cells were either untreated or treated with 1 g of SL-13 mAb. cell lines mouse monocytic cell line, WEHI 78/24, human cervical cancer cell lines, C33a and human leukaemic monocytic cell line, U937 were used in this study. TG-induced sterile peritonitis Wild-type CD13 (CD13WT) and CD13KO FVB/N, age-matched male mice 6\u20138 weeks of age were injected with 3% TG intraperitoneally. mouse CD13 forward primer was designed to introduce a notI site. all human, mouse, M/H, H/M constructs/chimera cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA/V5/GW/D-TOPO (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. d for an additional 18 hr in modified Eagle's medium. CD13-V5 over-expressing cells were enriched by puromycin selection (1 g/ml for 36 hr) RNA was isolated using Trizol according to manufacturer's instructions. unbound WEHI 78/24 cells were washed extensively. adherent cells were lysed and fluorescence was quantified by a fluorescence plate reader. each condition was assayed in triplicate. in vitro membrane dye labelling Fluorescence of differently labelled cells with PKH67 (green) and PKH26 (red) dye was quantified. thirty non-overlapping fields at 20 were individually counted for green and red dye. the CD11b+ Gr1hi pro-inflammatory monocyte population was diminished by nearly 70% in the CD13KO animals compared with wild type. analysis of CD13WT and CD13KO bone marrow, spleen, peripheral blood and lavage showed equivalent levels of immune cells under resting conditions. infiltrating inflammatory monocytes-Gr-1hi CD11b+, reparative monocytes- Gr-1lo CD11b+, macrophages \u2013 F4/80hi CD11b+, and dendritic cells \u2013 CD11chi CD11b+ in the live CD45+ cell population. data represent average of three independent experiments. Thioglycollate (TG) -administered peritoneal lavage was isolated from four CD13 wild-type mice and pooled for FACS sorting. the plot of infiltrating inflammatory monocytes \u2013 Gr-1hi CD11b+, intermediate population \u2013 Gr-1int CD11b+ and reparative monocytes \u2013 Gr-1lo CD11b+ in the live CD45+ cell population. the peritoneal lavage revealed a specific reduction in the numbers of inflammatory monocytes, F4/80+ macrophages and CD11c+ dendritic cells of CD13KO labelled cells compared with the CD13WT cells. identical results in experiments where the dyes were interchanged argued against dye-specific effects on trafficking. therefore, CD13 regulates inflammatory cell egress from the circulation into the peritoneum. cells in gr-1hi CD11b+ inflammatory monocytes, gr-1lo CD11b+ reparative monocytes F4/80+ CD11b+ macrophages and CD11c+ dendritic cells. data represent average of three independent experiments. CD13 expression in monocytes is a prerequisite for optimal cell trafficking in vivo. untreated mouse CD13 (mCD13-red) and SL-13 blocking antibody-treated mouse CD13 (SL13 tx mCD13-green) into thioglycollate-administered CD13 wild-type (CD13WT) mice. chimeras of mouse or human CD13 constructs fused to human CD13 C-terminus. exogenous human and mouse CD13 was highly expressed in adherent and monocytic pools. anti-hCD13 only recognizes lines expressing hCD13. mouse anti-CD13 mAb only recognizes mCD13. injected differentially labelled cells from each of the CD13-expressing monocyte lines or empty vector control cells into CD13WT mice followed by TG injection. the percentage of cells in the circulation in either chimeras or control vector remained the same (Fig. 6a,b). the C-terminal domain of CD13 participates in inflammatory cell trafficking. chimeric monocytic cell lines obtained with our chimeric monocytic cell lines in vivo are the result of CD13 homotypic adhesion. we performed an in vitro adhesion assay using our engineered lines and the activating anti-hCD13 mAb 452. monocytes that express the hCD13 C-terminus mediate homotypic adhesion to hCD13+ monolayer cells treated with the activating anti-hCD13 calcein-labelled WEHI 78/24 expressing empty vector, human CD13, mouse CD13, M/H CD13 or H/M CD13 constructs were added to the activated monolayer. homotypic cell adhesion was measured as fluorescence intensity at optical density at 485 and 530 nm. CD13 expression on both monocytes and the endothelium is critical for optimal cell trafficking in vivo. we injected differentially labelled wild-type and CD13KO splenic myeloid populations into either CD13WT or CD13KO recipients along with peritoneal TG administration. mice showed significantly reduced numbers of CD13KO labelled cells in the CD13KO recipient. inflammatory cell profiles are skewed in CD13KO animals in response to TG-induced peritonitis. inflammatory monocyte profiles are skewed in CD13KO animals in response to TG-induced peritonitis. analysis of CD13WT and CD13KO bone marrow, spleen, peripheral blood and lavage showed equivalent levels of immune cells under resting conditions. inflammatory monocyte population was elevated in the peripheral blood of CD13KO animals, perhaps indicating an inability of this subset to enter the peritoneum. infiltrating inflammatory monocytes-Gr-1hi CD11b+, reparative monocytes- Gr-1lo CD11b+, macrophages \u2013 F4/80hi CD11b+, and dendritic cells \u2013 CD11chi CD11b+ in the live CD45+ cell population. data represent average of three independent experiments. administered peritoneal lavage was isolated from four CD13 wild-type mice. the peritoneal lavage was pooled for FACS sorting. a plot of infiltrating inflammatory monocytes \u2013 Gr-1hi CD11b+. a specific reduction in the numbers of inflammatory monocytes, F4/80+ macrophages and CD11c+ dendritic cells of CD13KO labelled cells compared with the CD13WT cells. identical results in experiments where the dyes were interchanged argued against dye-specific effects on trafficking. therefore, CD13 regulates inflammatory cell egress from the circulation into the peritoneum. inflammatory monocytes, gr-1lo CD11b+ reparative monocytes and CD11c+ dendritic cells. data represent average of three independent experiments. CD13 expression in monocytes is a prerequisite for optimal cell trafficking in vivo. untreated mouse CD13 (mCD13-red) and SL-13 blocking antibody-treated mouse CD13 (SL13 tx mCD13-green) into thioglycollate-administered CD13 wild-type (CD13WT) mice. data represent average of three independent experiments. anti-hCD13 only recognizes lines expressing hCD13. mouse anti-CD13 mAb only recognizes mCD13. analysis of cell lines indicated that these were expressed at lower levels. a mixture of a mixture of (a) WEHI 78/24 cells transfected with H/M CD13-red and empty vector-green or a mixture of (b) H/M CD13-red and M/H CD13-green were injected into CD13 wild-type (CD13WT) mice and cell trafficking to the injured peritoneum was analysed by flow cytometry. cell lines in vivo are the result of CD13 homotypic adhesion. we performed an in vitro adhesion assay using our engineered lines and the activating anti-hCD13 mAb 452. monocytes that express the hCD13 C-terminus mediate homotypic adhesion to monolayers treated with the activating anti-hCD13 mAb 452. calcein-labelled WEHI 78/24 expressing empty vector, human CD13, mouse CD13, M/H CD13 or H/M CD13 constructs were added to the activated monolayer. homotypic cell adhesion was measured as fluorescence intensity at optical density at 485 and 530 nm. CD13 expression on both monocytes and the endothelium is essential for optimal cell trafficking in vivo. we injected differentially labelled wild-type and CD13KO splenic myeloid populations (T/B/NK-depleted) into either CD13WT or CD13KO recipients along with peritoneal TG administration. mice showed significantly reduced numbers of CD13KO labelled cells in the CD13KO recipient. peritoneal exudates from recipients of both genotypes were isolated, cytospun and analysed by microscopy. total number of green-WT or red-KO cells was calculated in the recipient mice. a global lack of CD13 led to distorted inflammatory cell profiles. CD13 is identical to aminopeptidase N, a cell surface peptidase that cleaves neutral amino acids from the N-terminus of small peptides. however, studies have determined that in addition to its ability to hydrolyse small peptides, CD13 is a multifunctional protein that plays both enzyme-dependent and -independent roles. blocking mAb SL13 strongly supports that the lack of CD13 directly affects monocyte\u2013endothelial cell adhesion and subsequent trafficking. chimeric expression constructs mapped the CD13 residues dictating the host range to small, species-specific amino acid differences in the CD13 C-terminus. the \u2018inflammatory\u2019 monocytes (Gr-1high Ly6Chigh, mouse; CD14+ CD16, human) can differentiate into both activating or inhibitory macrophage and dendritic cell subsets. the second group, the resident/reparative monocytes (Gr-1lo CD11b+) populate resting tissues and replenish tissue macrophages or dendritic cells. the relative contributions of the distinct patterns of trafficking, differential differentiation of cells once at the site of inflammation, and sequential trafficking strategies in the different tissues are currently unknown. the possibility that the selective expression of CD13 on myeloid cells as well as the inflamed endothelium may orchestrate some element of this process is intriguing."}
