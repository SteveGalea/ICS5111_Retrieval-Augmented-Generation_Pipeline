{"summary": "the ability of the NHS to provide expected service levels is entirely dependent on HCWs continuing to work as normal. in phase one, qualitative methods will be used to collect the views of a purposive sample of HCWs to determine the range of factors associated with their responses to pandemic influenza. the impact of a pandemic is likely to be the greatest in low income countries. despite the UK being a developed and relatively affluent country, the effects of an influenza pandemic are likely to be considerable. a case fatality rate of between 0.2 and 2.5% is assumed, based on previous pandemics. the ability of the NHS to provide even basic essential care is entirely dependent upon the remaining HCWs continuing to work as normal. it is debateable whether professionals have a duty to work normally during a pandemic or other emergency [9,11], and it is also debatable to what extent this duty could or should be enforced. trust in government and management may affect HCWs' perceptions and reactions to a pandemic. trust in the pandemic is being well-managed and information they are provided with is reliable might reassure individuals that the work they are being asked to do is an effective way of dealing with the pandemic. if attitudes identified as prevalent are based on misconceptions, an information campaign could be mounted to address these. primary aim of this research is to enhance contingency planning and national preparedness by: \u2022 Exploring HCWs' views about their obligations to continue working during an influenza pandemic. aims are: to determine factors related to pandemic influenza that may erode an HCWs' sense of professional obligation. focus groups, lasting around 90 minutes, will explore attitudes to working during an influenza pandemic. aim will be to encourage participants to discuss views about their own, and other HCWs', obligations to stay at post during a pandemic and to isolate and articulate the source of any sense of obligation. focus groups and interviews will be digitally recorded and then transcribed ad verbatim. facilitator will make use of counter examples and counterfactual cases to challenge particpant's claims. focus groups and interviews will be digitally recorded and then transcribed verbatim. the emerging themes will be used to inform the design of the postal/online survey in phase two. the analysis will be conducted by specialists in qualitative resesarch and medical sociology and by specialists in public health and medical ethics. content analysis will identify recurring themes relating to HCWs' willingness and ability to work. trusts will identify potential participants and letters of invitation will be sent with a participant information sheet. potential participants will be able to phone, text or e-mail for more information. GPs and community healthcare workers will be recruited through letters sent to general practices inviting participation. 1.3 million staff in the NHS, over 80% (1.145 million) are front line staff, with the rest (220,000) providing infrastructure support. nearly one-third of front-line employees are professionally qualified clinical staff (over 122,000 doctors and 404,000 nurses), the rest comprising non-clinical support staff. we have assumed a very conservative 25% response rate, an estimated 3,750 responses. this will be sufficient to determine the overall proportion with a positive attitude to continuing working with an overall precision of 2% (95% confidence), when a worst case assumption of 50% with a positive attitude to continuing working is used. our aim will be to ensure a minimum of 150 responses from each of the 10 groups of HCWs. structured telephone interviews will be offered to those with poor literacy levels or visual impairments. a large print version of the questionnniare will be available on request. a topic guide will ask a series of open questions: what do you know about pandemic influenza? how likely do you think pandemic influenza might have on your workplace? focus groups and interviews will be digitally recorded and then transcribed ad verbatim. hand-written notes will be taken as a back up to this process and to record non-verbal interactions. emerging themes will be identified and fed back into subsequent groups. the following groups were identified: 1 hospital doctors across specialties (consultants) 1 hospital doctors across specialties (non-consultants) 1 general Practitioners (GPs) 2 nurses across specialities and grades \u2013 including students, health care assistants (HCAs) and midwives. 1 community based HCWs \u2013 practice nurses, community midwives, health visitors. participants will have been in contact with a member of the research team. facilitator will ask more specific questions as and when appropriate. focus groups and interviews will be digitally recorded and then transcribed ad verbatim. recruitment Ten focus groups will be run, each with 6\u20138 participants, across the range of HCWs likely to be affected during a pandemic. the composition of these groups also has to accommodate the inhibitions individuals might feel in speaking freely. potential participants will be able to phone, text or e-mail for more information. GPs and Community Healthcare workers will be recruited through letters sent to general practices inviting participation. consent to participate in the focus group/interview will be taken by members of the research team as participants arrive. participants will have received a participant information sheet when they were invited to participate. 1.3 million staff in the NHS, over 80% are front line staff. nearly one-third of front-line employees are professionally qualified clinical staff. 6% of front-line employees are professionally qualified clinical staff. target population will comprise all HCWs (e.g. hospital doctors, public health doctors, GPs, community nurses, healthcare managers, nurses, allied health professionals, paramedics, porters, laboratory staff, hospital laundry workers and hospital cleaners) target population will comprise all HCWs with 80% power at the 5% significance level. potential participants will have received information about the questionnaire and the project at the time of the invitation. analysis Descriptive analyses will concentrate on the ratings given to the decision to continue to work. associations between attitudes to continued working, agreement/disagreement with ethical principles, category of HCW and demographic characteristics will be explored using non-parametric statistics. target population will comprise all HCWs (e.g. hospital doctors, public health doctors, GPs, community nurses, healthcare managers, nurses, allied health professionals, paramedics, porters, laboratory staff, hospital laundry workers and hospital cleaners) target population will comprise all HCWs. a large print version of the questionnniare will be available on request. participants will have received information about the questionnaire and the project at the time of the invitation. analysis Descriptive analyses will concentrate on the ratings given to the decision to continue to work, including the percentage with a positive attitude. the response of HCWs to this pressure will determine how well the health service can cope during this crisis. it is vital to have information about how motivated HCWs will be to continue to work during such a crisis, and what factors might influence their decision to work."}
