{"summary": "recombinant baculoviruses are large viruses with circular double-stranded DNA genomes of 88\u2013153 kb [7], which makes it laborious to manipulate and generate recombinant baculoviruses. several construction strategies have been developed to increase the efficiency of recombinant baculovirus generation. baculoviruses have a biphasic life cycle in which two distinct forms of the virus spread throughout tissues and among individuals. some virus encoded proteins involved in ODV structure are not required to maintain virus cell to cell infectivity or virus replication. defective-rescue BmNPV Bacmid (reBmBac) expression system was established by using convenient tools such as phage the red recombinase system, the FLP/FRT (FLP recombinase recognition target) recombinase system [30], the rpsL-neo counter-resistance system [31, 32] and antibiotic resistance genes. copyControl pCC1BAC vector and luciferase assay system obtained from Promega. DH10Bac/pMON7124 (carrying a tetracycline resistance gene), transfer vector pVL1393 and Lipofectin were obtained from Invitrogen. low-melting agarose was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. the pPolh-1629 vector was used to construct the defective BmBac lacking a portion of the essential ORF1629 gene. the homologous arms were amplified from the BmNPV genome and inserted into the pMD18-T simple vector. the tetracycline resistance (tetR) gene was amplified from the pMON7124 plasmid and inserted between the arms by XhoI digestion. the plasmid pVL1393-PoIFN- was used to deliver the PoIFN- gene. the porcine IFN- gene was amplified and inserted into the pVL1393 vector by BamHI/EcoRI digestion. the targeting element with homologous arms was isolated by digestion or PCR from the targeting vector. the counter-selection gene was removed with FLP recombinase. the positive clones were selected on strR antibiotic plates after culture. the positive clones were also further screened by PCR. transfer vector DNA were mixed with 6 L of Lipofectin in a total volume of 60 L and incubated at room temperature for 15\u201330 min. the supernatants of cells transfected with recombinant virus were collected after culturing for 5 days at 25\u201327\u00b0C and stored at 4\u00b0C. silkworm larvae and pupae were reared or incubated at 25\u201327\u00b0C. the pCC-chi-cat vector was used to construct the defective BmBac. homologous targeting arms were amplified to remove the cathepsin (GeneID: 1724490) and chitinase (GeneID: 1724489) genes and were inserted into pUC19 via ecoRI/HindIII digestion. the transfer plasmid pVL1393-luc was used to deliver the luc+ gene into reBmBac. the luc+ gene was removed from the pGL3-Basic vector by BglII/XbaI digestion and then transferred to a BamHI/XbaI-digested pVL1393 vector. positive clones were selected after culture with the appropriate antibiotic. positive clones were further screened by PCR with primers that spanned the viral genome sequence and targeted element sequence. cells were washed twice in TC100 medium without FBS and added with the mixture of transfection or cotransfection. the cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 (multiplicity of infection of 0.1 p.f.u. per cell) for 1\u20132 h. the expression level of luciferase in 50 g of protein lysate was assayed with a Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) the amount of protein in the lysate was measured by western blotting. the antiviral activity of recombinant porcine IFNs was detected by western blotting. vector contained the rpsL-neo counter-selection gene and several mutant sites. however, FRT sequences with two mutant sites were inactivated. copyControl origin was inserted into BmNPV genomic DNA to inactivate the cat and chi genes. BmBac DNA was extracted by alkaline lysis method and transfected into Bm5 cells to confirm that the shuttle vector could replicate in both E. coli and insect cells. the extracted BmBac DNA was then transformed back into E. coli for the following study. the pPolh-1629 vector was constructed to knock out the function of this gene. a portion of the essential ORF1629 gene was deleted from the BmBac DNA. a 2.3 kb tetR element fragment was obtained from pPolh-1629 via PstI digestion and purification. chlR and tetR genes were introduced in the ORF1629 gene-defective BmBac vector. the tetR gene would be replaced during cotransfection. one antibiotic resistance gene is sufficient for genetic manipulation in coli. thus the chlR gene should also be deleted to ensure environmental biosafety. positive clones that lacked the chlR and rpsL-neo genes were selected on antibiotic-containing plates. the positive plasmid was replaced with the FRT-rpsL-neo fragment by homologous recombination. the rpsL-neo counter-resistance gene was removed through FLP recombination. luciferase gene was obtained from the pGL3-Basic vector by using BglII/XbaI digestion. pVL1393-luc and reBmBac DNA were cotransfected into Bm5 cells. the supernatant contained recombinant BmNPV (reBm-luc) was collected after 4\u20135 days of incubation. luciferase expression in silkworms was not significantly different from that of original viral stocks. recombinant virus acquired in cotransfection was pure and with stably expression level of luciferase. the purity of the recombinant virus harvested via cotransfection approached 100%. recombinant reBm-PoIFN- virus was injected into larvae or pupae. expression product of porcine IFN- was analysed by western blotting. no immunoreactive protein was detected in the negative control sample. the highest antiviral activity was 2.4 0.7x106 IU/mL of haemolymph. the activity of PoIFN- in one mililiter of haemolymph from the best sample was equal to that of 271.4 81.5 g standard recombinant porcine IFN- (R&D Systems, USA) copyControl origin was inserted into BmNPV genomic DNA to inactivate the cat and chi genes. a 7.9 kb fragment (chlR-ori) was obtained from the pCC-chi-cat vector by EcoRI/HindIII digestion and was then purified using gel electrophoresis. positive clones were identified and screened by a PCR assay. BmBac DNA was extracted by the alkaline lysis method and transfected into Bm5 cells to confirm that the shuttle vector could replicate in both E. coli and insect cells. the extracted BmBac DNA was then transformed back into E. coli for the following study. pPolh-1629 vector contained two homologous arms of the polyhedrin and ORF1629 genes. tetracycline resistance gene was inserted between the arms as a selectable marker. a portion of the essential ORF1629 gene was deleted from the BmBac DNA. chlR and tetR genes were introduced in the ORF1629 gene-defective BmBac vector. the tetR gene would be replaced during cotransfection, and it was not present in the recombinant baculoviruses. the chlR gene should also be deleted to ensure environmental biosafety. the chlR gene was replaced with the rpsL-neo fragment by homologous recombination. the positive plasmid was transformed into electrocompetent DH10B cells. positive clones that lacked the chlR and rpsL-neo genes were selected on tetR and strR (streptomycin resistance) antibiotic-containing plates. luciferase gene was obtained from the pGL3-Basic vector by using BglII/XbaI digestion. pVL1393-luc and reBmBac DNA were cotransfected into Bm5 cells. the supernatant contained recombinant BmNPV (reBm-luc) was collected after 4\u20135 days of incubation. the recombinant virus acquired in cotransfection was pure and with stably expression level of luciferase. twenty-four reBm-luc plaques were isolated and used to infect Bm5 cells cultured in 24 plates. the purity of the recombinant virus harvested via cotransfection approached 100%. recombinant reBm-PoIFN- virus was injected into larvae or pupae. expression product of porcine IFN- was analysed by western blotting. no immunoreactive protein was detected in the negative control sample. the highest antiviral activity was 2.4 0.7x106 IU/mL. the activity of PoIFN- in one mililiter of haemolymph was equal to that of 271.4 81.5 g standard recombinant porcine IFN- (R&D Systems, USA) recombinant proteins expressed in silkworm larvae or pupae were harvested after an additional 4\u20135 days. the Bm-Bac-to-Bac system and the BacPAK system are two typical and commonly used baculovirus expression systems. a foreign gene can be inserted into BmNPV baculovirus DNA in E. coli by using the Bm-Bac-to-Bac system, which is a convenient and easy-to-use expression vector for recombinant baculovirus. the batch production of different baculoviruses can be achieved conveniently via one-step cotransfection. it is much more convenient to prepare a large amount of high-quality parental viral genome DNA by using the reBmBac BEVS system because of the CopyControl ori. mBac viral DNA, extracted from E. coli by induction or non-induction methods, are different. the same amount but different quality of pVL1393-luc transfer vector DNA mixed with the same tube of well-preserved pVL1393-luc vector. luminescence from cells and larvae could reach a tenfold difference. we performed 8\u201312 cotransfections in two 6-well cell culture plates for one batch. the luciferase reporter evaluated the recombination and expression efficiency in silkworms. the luciferase expression level was stable by using this reBmBac system. recombinant recombinant virus stocks could be at least twofold higher than cotransfection stock. this optimization of expression level is recommended step for further large-scale production. copy number for Bacmids could increase by 10- to 20-fold upon induction. the deletion of the chlR gene was also an example of the genetic manipulation of viral genes or the introduction of foreign genes into the other baculoviral genome sites in E. coli. the remaining FRT sequence is inactivated after recombination, which is favourable for the stability of the viral genome. the luminescence of 50 g of proteins lysed from cells and larval haemolymph indicates the expression of luciferase. the three rounds of expression in larval haemolymph were not different from the original viral stocks. the cell-control and Larvae-Control were the cells and larvae samples infected with non-luc recombinant BmNPV. the standard sample was reconstituted at 50 g/mL and its antiviral activity was about 4.5 x 106 IU/mL. the negative control sample was the non-interferon recombinant BmNPV infected larvae and it showed no antiviral activity."}
