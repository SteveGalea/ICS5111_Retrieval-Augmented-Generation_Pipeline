{"summary": "the study population (n = 77) comprised 8 litters of 3-d-old male and female Sprague\u2013Dawley rat pups. rats were free of rat coronavirus, rat Theiler virus, Kilham rat virus, rat parvovirus, toolan H1 virus, rat minute virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, murine adenovirus types 1 and 2, reovirus type 3, sendai anesthesia was induced by using an induction chamber (2 L 100% O2 containing either isoflurane at 5% or sevoflurane at 8%) each pup was maintained by using a nose cone (500 mL of 100% O2 with either isoflurane at 3.5% 0.1%. the pups (including 2 unmanipulated pups as controls) were euthanized by rapid decapitation. blood was collected in a 0.5-mL microfuge tube for analysis of corticosterone and glucose. time to recovery (return of righting reflex) was recorded. rats were free of rat coronavirus, rat Theiler virus, Kilham rat virus, rat parvovirus, Toolan H1 virus, rat minute virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, murine adenovirus types 1 and 2, reovirus type 3, sendai virus, mites, lice, and pinworms. animals were housed in static microisolation cages on a 12:12-h dark:light all pups within a litter were tested on postnatal day 4. rats were randomly assigned to 3 experimental treatment groups. each pup was weighed prior to the start of anesthesia. the times to loss of righting reflex and paw withdrawal were recorded. at 15 min after induction, a 0.5-cm skin incision was made over the right lateral thigh. the incision was closed with cyanoacrylate glue (Vetbond, 3M Animal Care Products, St Paul, MN) rat serum corticosterone was measured by using a quantitative enzyme immunoassay. the assay has a lower limit of detection of 0.17 ng/mL and less than 10% intraassay variation. baseline HR was 290 8.8 and 278 7.8 bpm at 1 min after anesthetic induction. RR for the isoflurane, sevoflurane, and hypothermia groups gradually declined over time. the %SpO2 measured at 5 min (51% 8%), 10 min (23% 7%) and 15 min (23% 7%) after induction were significantly lower than the corresponding values for the isoflurane and sevoflurane groups. the paw withdrawal reflex was lost at nearly the same time in all 3 groups. corticosterone levels in blood samples collected at 20 min after induction were 9.4 1.1 g/dL in the isoflurane group. 12.6 5.6 g/dL in the sevoflurane group, and 13.5 1.8 g/dL in the hypothermia group. data are given as mean SEM. value is significantly (P 0.05) different from those of other groups. weight gain at 24 h after anesthesia induction did not differ among groups. %SpO2 measured at 5 min (51% 8%), 10 min (23% 7%) and 15 min (23% 7%) after induction were significantly lower than the corresponding values for the isoflurane and sevoflurane groups. %SpO2 measured at 5 min (51% 8%), 10 min (23% 7%), and 15 min (23% 7%) after induction. neonatal rats lost their righting reflex significantly (P 0.05) faster in both the isoflurane and sevoflurane groups than in the hypothermia (3 0 min) group. but the paw withdrawal reflex was lost at nearly the same time in all 3 groups. serum glucose values were significantly higher at the 20-min point (isoflurane, 144.1 3.9 mg/dL; sevoflurane, 142.1 3.3 mg/dL; hypothermia, 116.9 2.2 mg/dL) glucose levels at 20 min after induction were higher in the isoflurane and sevoflurane groups than in the hypothermia group. neonatal anesthesia and surgery has been reported to result occasionally in postoperative mortality as a result of cannibalism or neglect by the dam. previous studies have indicated that cannibalism after anesthetic and surgical treatment of pups is low in incidence overall and most severe among dams already in distress or with disturbed pups. hypothermia anesthesia was 7 min longer for hypothermia anesthesia than for isoflurane or sevoflurane groups. a longer recovery time is associated with a delayed return of essential physiologic functions, including respiratory and cardiovascular function. the stress-induced release of glucocorticoids by the adrenal cortex is a basic physiologic response in mammals. rats secrete the glucocorticoid corticosterone in response to a variety of stressors. a difference in corticosterone levels may be hard to detect due to the age of the pups. hypothermia is a relevant procedure-related complication because of its influence on lost nursing time. in neonatal pups, hypoglycemia is a relevant procedure-related complication because of its influence on lost nursing time. voflurane and sevoflurane offer additional physiologic stability. future studies should continue to analyze potential changes that occur in neonatal rodents. factors for consideration should include availability of equipment, scavenging of waste gas, familiarity of personnel with the agent."}
