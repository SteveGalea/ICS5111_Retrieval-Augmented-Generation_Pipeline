{"summary": "leptospirosis is a geographically widespread zoonosis. it is caused by species of spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. pathogenic leptospires can persist in the proximal renal tubules. the adhesion of pathogens to mammalian cells will provoke multiple changes in the physiology and/or gene expression of the host. microarrays are a powerful tool to explore those host-pathogen interactions by analyzing the transcriptional profiles of host cells or pathogens. human macrovascular endothelial cell line was grown in modified Eagle medium. both cell lines were cultured in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. both cell media were supplemented with 1 U/mL penicillin, 1 g/mL streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine. rogans serovar canicola (pathogenic, strain ATCC 23606 and strain 11203-32) were obtained from the ATCC and Dr. Richard Zuerner (USDA, Ames, IA) the bacteria were enumerated using a Petroff-Hausser counting chamber and dark field microscopy. 2107 cells per sample were incubated in suspension with either L. biflexa serovar Patoc or L. interrogans serovar Canicola. cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and harvested for RNA isolation. the quality of RNA was checked using a bioanalyzer. raw gene expression was imported from Imagene to GeneSifter (GeneSifter.Net, VizX Labs, Seattle, WA) for analysis. data from 3 biological replicate experiments were normalized using Lowess normalization and by the median of the raw intensities for each spot. slides were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 3% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde. cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed three more times with PBS, and blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C with HEPES buffered saline (HBS) endothelial cell lines EA.hy926 and HMEC were plated in 3.0 m (2106 pores/cm2) polyester transwell inserts. monolayer was washed with PBS and cell medium without antibiotics was added to the inserts and wells. live cells (bright green cytoplasm) and dead cells (bright blue nuclei) were enumerated in at least three fields per sample in at least three independent experiments. the cells were stained using the Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit 2 (Molecular Probes), which stains for annexin V and membrane permeability. both cell lines were cultured in the modified Eagle medium recommended by the supplier in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. both cell media were supplemented with 1 U/mL penicillin, 1 g/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine for routine propagation. the roles of proteoglycans in the endothelial cell response to L. interrogans were tested based on previously published protocols. the bacteria were enumerated using a Petroff-Hausser counting chamber and dark field microscopy. they were plated in tissue culture flasks (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA) and grown up to 90% or higher confluence. the MOI (multiplicity of infection) used was 10 bacteria per mammalian cell. cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and harvested for RNA isolation. the quality of RNA was checked using a bioanalyzer. images were overlaid and analyzed using Imagene (BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA) Raw gene expression was imported from Imagene to GeneSifter (GeneSifter.Net, VizX Labs, Seattle, WA) for analysis. data from 3 biological replicate experiments were normalized using Lowess normalization. cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C with HEPES buffered saline (HBS) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) plated in 3.0 m (2106 pores/cm2) polyester transwell inserts. lack of penetration of the fluorescent dye FITC-dextran 40,000. monolayer was washed with PBS and cell medium without antibiotics was added to the inserts. live cells (bright green cytoplasm) and dead cells (bright blue nuclei) were enumerated in at least three fields per sample in at least three independent experiments. the cells were stained using the Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit 2 (Molecular Probes), which stains for annexin V and membrane permeability. a second TUNEL-based kit, alert DNA Fragmentation kit, was also used. the comparisons were made between cells infected with the indicated bacterial strain vs. uninfected controls at 1 hr. post infection. the same pathways also showed significant changes in expression, in similar patterns, in a second endothelial cell line, HMEC. Rho GTPase activating protein 5 (RhoGAP5) was not differentially regulated in response to the bacteria. both genes were downregulated in response to the pathogenic leptospires and upregulated in response to the non-pathogen. effect of decreased GNA13 may be to decrease stimulation of Rho. integrin v +1.69 2.46 Less adhesion to ECM in cells infected with L. interrogans vs. L. biflexa (reviewed in [50]) CAV2 (ECM, FA) caveolin 2 +1.81 2.30 L. interrogans vs. L. biflexa (reviewed in [50]) titin +1.78 1.78 decreased actin polymerization, or rates thereof, in cells infected with L. interrogans vs. L. biflexa [54] TNC (ECM, ACT) tenascin 1.66 +1.90 more synthesis of this ECM component in cells infected with L. interrogans vs. L. biflexa ITGB1 (FA, ECM, ACT, TEM) integrin 1 +1 a fundamental stage in pathogenesis of Leptospira infections is the ability of the bacteria to cross mucous membranes and underlying epithelial barriers. pathogenic leptospires may be indirectly targeting the cytoskeleton via cell surface attachment mechanisms that co-opt the host cell signaling to achieve the same result. the cortical actin has largely disappeared in cells infected with L. interrogans Canicola by 1 hour post-infection. stress fibers have disappeared and cell rounding is evident by 3 hours. changes in endothelial cell morphology were most evident. micrographs are representative of multiple (>12) independent experiments. L. interrogans Copenhageni caused essentially the same changes in endothelial cell morphology as L. interrogans Canicola. however, no decrease in endothelial cell viability was found by any of several criteria. staining indicates DNA fragmentation consistent with apoptosis. nuclei are also stained with propidium iodide (red) and the F actin cytoskeleton is stained with phalloidin (blue). micrographs do not demonstrate any indication of apoptosis in L. interrogans-infected cells. -xyloside inhibits transfer of glycosaminoglycan chains to protein cores. a control sugar analog, -galactoside, was tested in parallel. inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis did not fully prevent the damage to the endothelial cell layers caused by L. interrogans. a number of proteins predicted in the published L. interrogans genomes are not present in the L. biflexa genome. they include proteins containing leucine-rich repeats, which are involved in many protein-protein interactions. this includes proteins containing leucine-rich repeats, which are involved in many protein-protein interactions. several drugs currently in use in humans have been reported to have endothelial barrier protective function. all are in use as anti-hypertensive therapeutics, and some for other therapeutic purposes as well. we therefore tested four different drugs with different mechanisms of action for the ability to prevent the damage to endothelial layers in culture caused by L. interrogans. no inhibition of adhesion of 35S-labeled bacteria was seen even at a concentration of lisinopril 10 fold over the concentration used for these experiments. lisinopril, telmisartan, dopamine, or furosemide were added to 1 M. ACE2 is not inhibitable by lisinopril, but is a receptor for the SARS virus. it is also possible that the effect of lisinopril in our system is not related to ACE inhibition, but is instead due to additional effects of lisinopril, such as inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis. this may lead to increased NO synthesis, which is protective of endothelial function in the face of a variety of insults protective effects of lisinopril were maintained even at a dose of 100 nM. it will also be interesting to investigate the possibility that patients on lisinopril fare better than not on this therapy during leptospirosis outbreaks. ochete, Treponema denticola, produces the protein Msp, which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton in neutrophils and fibroblasts. these activities are likely to facilitate invasion and colonization of periodontal tissues by T. denticola. previous work by another laboratory demonstrated that L. interrogans Copenhageni crosses MDCK canine kidney epithelial cell layers in culture more rapidly than does L. biflexa Patoc. leptospires may be able to establish disseminated infection in part due to the binding of the bacteria to one or more mammalian cell surface receptors. deciphering the role of, and mechanisms behind, actin rearrangement in response to pathogenic Leptospira."}
