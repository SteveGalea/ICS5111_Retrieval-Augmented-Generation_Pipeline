{"summary": "HCMV infection is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised populations, individuals with heart disease and recipients of solid organ and bone marrow transplant. HCMV initiates a programmed cascade of gene expression, resulting in production of infectious virus. two of the first genes to be expressed are the major immediate early (IE72) and IE2 (IE86) VCP belongs to the hexameric AAA ATPase family and plays a pivotal role in ubiquitin mediated signaling through remodeling target proteins. it is able to segregate target proteins from associated cellular membranes or larger protein complexes. a central signalling hub for ubiquitin mediated regulation. VCP plays a role in US11-specific degradation of MHC class I protein during HCMV infection [27] a direct role for VCP in the replication of HCMV has not previously been reported. previously, we identified the host gene ATP6V0C as a critical factor in HCMV virus production. the original siRNA pool was deconvoluted to test the four individual siRNAs against VCP. all four siRNAs resulted in reduced VCP expression and reduced HCMV replication based on GFP fluorescence. the third siRNA of the pool generated less efficient VCP knockdown. a complete block in HCMV replication results in a complete block in HCMV replication. human primary fibroblast cells were transfected with 160 siRNA pools against membrane organization genes then infected with a negative control siRNA. assays were performed in duplicate with three biological repeats. IE1 expression levels were higher relative to control cells, up until day four post infection. knockdown of VCP results in a specific loss of the major immediate early protein IE2. we hypothesized that VCP may play a role in IE2 protein stability. Knockdown of VCP results in substantial reduction in IE2 transcript expression. results consistent with previous publications showing inhibition of proteasome reducing IE2 expression and HCMV replication. increased IE1 and IE2 RNA levels at 24 HPI may be a result of increased MIE promoter activity due to the associated loss of IE2 protein expression at early time points. IE1 transcript levels decrease rapidly 24 to 48 HPI, while protein levels remain high, suggesting that IE1 protein is stable. fibroblast cells were transfected with siRNA against VCP or negative control siRNA and infected with HCMV at an MOI of three. Stability of IE1 and IE2 transcript was determined by Northern blot analysis. the annotated exons of the major immediate early region were clearly apparent from the mapped reads in all six samples. reads corresponding to the splice junctions were consistent with previous data for the region. splicing of the MIE primary transcript is heavily biased towards IE1 at 24 hours, with IE2 splicing increasing as the infection progresses. splice junction (IE2) and a corresponding increase in read pairs spanning exon three to four splice junction (IE1) knockdown of VCP alters splicing of MIE transcripts resulting in a failure to switch from IE1 splicing to IE2 splicing. results show that knockdown of VCP alters splicing of MIE transcripts. read counts mapping to the viral genome were relatively similar at 24 HPI. expression levels of UL36 and UL37, UL112/113 and the MIE transcripts UL122 (IE2) and UL123 (IE1) were relatively higher at 24HPI in VCP knockdown cells compared to control cells. however, at 48 and 72 HPI there is more profound global suppression of virus gene expression in VCP knockdown cells. expression of a subset of viral genes remains high following knockdown of VCP. this is particularly surprising for UL112/113 which has previously been identified as a target for IE2 transactivation. alterations in IE1 gene expression and relative changes in IE1 and IE2 splicing are not an artifact of delayed virus replication. splicing by VCP is not a consequence of alterations in cell cycle control. in uninfected cells, VCP staining resulted in diffuse signal throughout the cell. by 48 HPI VCP was consistently found within two large puncta within the nucleus, which increased in size by 72 hours. such staining is characteristic of the viral replication compartments. total protein was harvested every 24 hours for a total of five days. treatment with 1M of NMS-873 recapitulated the phenotypic effects of VCP siRNA. treatment with NMS-873 did not result in increased IE1 expression. this may be due to additional off target effects of the drug. treatment with NMS-873 also showed little toxicity at effective concentrations. treatment with NMS-873 causes same phenotype as knockdown of VCP. cells were pretreated with 1M NMS-873 then infected at high MOI. blast cells were double transfected with each siRNA pool in 96 well format. the cells were infected with a low passage HCMV strain expressing GFP from an SV40 promoter. analysis of the screen indicated both increased and decreased virus replication ranging from 88% reduction in GFP levels to a 84% increase. fected at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of three with TB40E-GFP. supernatant was collected at 24-hour time points for seven days total. no amplification of infectious virus was observed in cells knocked down for VCP. Western blot analysis was performed to measure the levels of each of the major kinetic classes of HCMV genes. in control cells, protein expression of each class of virus gene is clearly observed. however, in cells knocked down for VCP, neither IE2 nor downstream viral gene expression was detected. MG132 (proteasome inhibitor\u2013ubiquitin dependent) and pepstatin A or E64 (protease inhibitors\u2013ubiquitin independent) inhibited the two main pathways of protein degradation. Neither MG132, pepstatin A, nor E64 rescued the loss of IE2 proteins levels. knockdown of VCP or control siRNA resulted in a substantial reduction of IE2 RNA levels at 48 and 72 HPI, including the smaller IE60 and IE40 species. this result was confirmed by qRT-PCR, using primers specific for IE1 and IE2 transcript. IE1 transcript levels do not substantially increase after 24 HPI, in contrast to control cells. RNA levels were measured following treatment of cells with actinomycin D 48 HPI. actinomycin D inhibits RNA polymerase, blocking new transcription of IE1 and IE2. stability of both IE1 and IE2 transcripts modestly increased by 1.8 and 1.5 fold respectively. RNAseq analysis was performed to determine whether knockdown of VCP altered differential splicing of the MIE region. this allows a direct comparison of read counts from the first three shared exons of the MIE transcripts to the IE1 and IE2 specific exons four and five. this controls for changes in promoter activity and effects of genome amplification. knockdown of VCP has no effect on the relative proportion of reads mapping to exon four and five. by 48 HPI there is a clear increase in the relative proportion of reads mapping to exon four. knockdown of VCP has no effect on the relative proportion of reads mapping to the shared exons, indicating reduced splicing from exon three to five (IE2). RNA-seq analysis was performed to measure relative splicing levels of the MIE region following VCP knockdown. the proportion of total reads mapping to each of the five exons was calculated. the proportion of reads mapping to exon 3 whose matching pair maps to either exons 2, 4 or 5 is unaffected by VCP knockdown. expression levels of UL36 and UL37, UL112/113 and the MIE transcripts UL122 (IE2) and UL123 (IE1) were relatively higher at 24HPI in VCP knockdown cells compared to control cells. however, at 48 and 72 HPI there is more profound global suppression of virus gene expression in VCP knockdown cells. cyclin dependent kinases are required for efficient IE2 expression. cyclin A2 overexpression inhibits IE2 splicing and virus replication. knockdown of VCP has no gross effect on cell cycle control. untransfected cells were treated with 0.5 g/ml nocodazole as a positive control of G2/M arrest. DNA content was then measured by FACS analysis and defined as G1, S or G2 using FlowJo software. VCP inhibitor NMS-873 is a potent and selective inhibitor of HCMV replication. a number of effective small molecule inhibitors of VCP have been developed. a number of effective small molecule inhibitors of VCP have been developed. s, with an IC50 of 0.13 M compared to 1.3 M for Ganciclovir. treating cells 24 HPI did not reduce IE2 expression or virus production to the same extent. treatment with NMS-873 also showed little toxicity at effective concentrations. VCP plays a pivotal role in ubiquitin-dependent signaling through remodeling target proteins, often leading to proteosomal degradation. knockdown of VCP resulted in an initial increase in MIE transcription, followed by a substantial reduction in expression of the major immediate early transcript IE2. splicing to IE2 terminal exon 5 increases, with corresponding decrease in IE1 splicing. expression of the MIE transcripts and their splicing are intimately linked to multiple factors including cell cycle, cell type and differentiation status. expression of the MIE transcripts and their splicing are intimately linked to multiple factors including cell cycle, cell type and differentiation status. studies have identified equally important and diverse roles for VCP in the nucleus. the association of VCP with the viral replication compartments early in infection suggests that the nuclear functions of VCP may be playing a critical role in HCMV replication. previous reports have shown that HCMV induces the host DNA damage response. a negative regulator of IE2 splicing exists at early stages during HCMV infection. such a factor could regulate MIE splicing by promoting polyadenylation of the IE1 transcript, thereby inhibiting read-through to the IE2 final exon. treatment at 24 HPI was ineffective at blocking IE2 expression. studies have shown that increased expression of the polyadenylation factor cstF-64 promotes polyadenylation upstream of the exons required for membrane bound IgM resulting in increased expression of the secreted form. splicing factor SRSF3 (SRp20) binds to a polyA enhancer sequence and directs polyadenylation of the upstream terminal exon by splicing and enhanced expression of the downstream terminal exon. a number of small molecule inhibitors have been developed for use against HCMV since the licensing of Ganciclovir. a number of small molecule inhibitors have been developed, the most potent of which is NMS-873 [36].
