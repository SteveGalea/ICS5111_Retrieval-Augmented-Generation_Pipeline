{"summary": "the built environment can be modified to promote healthy behaviours and reduce the risk of contracting a disease. disease was the raison d'\u00eatre for the advent of urban planning in the past century. urban environments such as London, Paris, New York City and Chicago were densely populated and characterized by residences with little airflow or light. chronic disease, such as depression, has been linked to social and physical aspects of the built environment. chronic disease is defined as a non-communicable disease that persists for a long time. chronic disease is caused by pathogenic microorganisms and can be prevented by vaccination or cured by medication. containment becomes the main strategy for defence. non-human animals are also prone to both chronic and infectious diseases. the built environment can promote both the containment and containment of disease in human and non-human animals. design approaches to health problems and what is considered as a problem. the aim of architectural and urban designs and behaviour interventions is to enhance overall well-being through mental and physical health. chronic disease can happen at many social and biological scales. we consider how the architecture of the human environment can contribute to the prevention of chronic disease\u2014related to both physical health and mental health. we consider three themes to illustrate health-promoting qualities of physical environment. first, we describe how the built environment promotes physical activity. neotraditional communities promote social interaction, sense of community and walking. a fourth and fifth D have been added: Destination accessibility (i.e. ease of travel to a central business district) and Distance to transit (i.e. the average distance from the residence to the workplace) building areas specifically programmed for physical activity can also contribute to occupants' total physical activity. research has also begun to examine the effect of small-scale environmental changes on increasing physical activity or reducing sedentary behaviour, particularly within the workplace. a study of the new york city food environment found that access to healthy food stores was inversely associated with body mass index and obesity prevalence [29]. in a rare natural experiment, research has begun to examine how design features affect dietary intake. small-scale environmental features such as plate size can be modified to mitigate over-consumption. mental health In addition to its effects on health-related behaviours, the built environment can affect mental health, both positively and negatively. urban environments have been associated with psycho-social processes, such as personal control, crowding and presence of social networks and support [41,45,46]. physiological and psychological stressors have the capacity to influence mental health both at the individual level (e.g. individuals' perception of the environment) and through neighbourhood effects (e.g. the experience of neighbourhood walkability and state of maintenance and upkeep and upkeep) housing quality, housing type and floor level are three aspects of housing that have been associated with mental health outcomes. poor housing quality can lead to increased social withdrawal which in turn leads to poor mental health. architectural interior design can help reduce the need to socially withdraw. architecture might modulate people's physiological response in the case of acute as well as prolonged or chronic stress, especially when their causes are found in a complex socio-economic network. the aim of this paper is to highlight the myriad ways that the built environment shapes social relations and behaviour in space. built structures that facilitate social interaction reduce stress because grooming in primates and ungulates alleviates stress through the release of -endorphins. housing conditions of rhesus macaques can influence their social environment, elevating their stress levels if they are housed alone. housing conditions that lead to stereotypical behaviour of rodents used for research may affect validity, replicability and reliability of studies. the built environment, i.e. the ants' nest, provides shelter that may promote longevity. in mammals too, captivity can increase longevity, especially for species with a fast pace of life, for whom captive conditions, such as zoos, provide protection from predators. explore the potential of the built environment as a therapeutic tool to alleviate stress and anxiety. explore the topics of biophilic design and cognitive restoration as elements of passive design care. raise the question of care in the context of geographical disparities in health and the issues stemmm from the lack of care in the state of the built environment. biophilic design emphasizes the necessity of maintaining, enhancing and restoring the beneficial experience of nature in the built environment [94] biophilic design emphasizes the necessity of maintaining, enhancing and restoring the beneficial experience of nature in the built environment. patients randomly assigned to a nature intervention showed significant improvements in attentional capacity compared to those in the non-intervention group. this work suggests that we have two types of attention: effortful \u2018directed\u2019 attention and \u2018involuntary\u2019 attention that is captured easily and effortlessly. the natural environment engages involuntary attention and allows the mechanism underlying directed attention to rest and recover. in black neighbourhoods, the availability of chain supermarkets was 52% of what it was in white neighbourhoods. a similar pattern is evident with respect to the natural environment, which has well-documented beneficial effects on human health and well-being [95,96]. habitat quality is key in determining population structure and competition in animals. low population densities result in lower competition and better access to resources. need for shelter can create socially facultative structures in animals that would not be social otherwise. three themes illustrate health-promoting qualities of physical environment. first, we consider how the physical environment promotes physical activity. this helps to prevent obesity and the associated chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease and cancer. pedestrian-oriented designs have small lots, short setback distances (i.e. distance from the street to the front of the building), porches and sidewalks. car-oriented suburbs typically have 1 acre (or larger) lots, large setbacks and no sidewalks. activity within a building can help to ensure that physical activity is \u2018built in\u2019 to daily activities. for example, daily tasks that require physical activity include going to a central location to retrieve mail, get coffee, or pick up lunch. research has also begun to examine the effect of small-scale environmental changes on increasing physical activity. social norms can be used as \u2018anchors\u2019 to influence behaviour. framing physical activity as fun, rather than obligatory, could also affect people's likelihood to engage in physical activity. a study of the new york city food environment found that access to healthy food stores was inversely associated with obesity prevalence. large plates, portions and packages influence people to consume more. small-scale environmental features such as plate size can be modified to mitigate over-consumption. mental health In addition to its effects on health-related behaviours, the built environment can affect mental health. a recent report on the \u2018five Ways to Well-being\u2019 shows how the social-physical interdependency can be used in the design of architectural and urban spaces. the \u2018connect\u2019 idea correlates the quantity and quality of social connections with reported well-being and physical health. \u2018take notice\u2019 considers the benefits of mindfulness and paying attention to the present as way to reduce the symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. housing quality, housing type and floor level are three aspects of housing that have been associated with mental health outcomes. poor housing quality can lead to increased social withdrawal which in turn leads to poor mental health. architectural interior design can help to reduce the need to socially withdraw. erators or \u2018effect modifiers\u2019 influence the valence and strength of the impact of the environment on human health and health-related behaviours. this notion is illustrated by Evans et al.\u2019s findings [59] that architectural depth moderates the effect of crowding on mental health. design has been revisited via neotraditional or new urbanist neighbourhoods that are pedestrian-, rather than car-focused. such pedestrian-oriented designs have small lots, short setback distances (i.e. distance from the street to the front of the building), porches and sidewalks. the features of neotraditional communities promote social interaction, sense of community and walking. design of \u2018connecting spaces\u2019 such as corridors, stairways, elevators and lobbies can play a critical role in encouraging physical activity within a building. daily tasks that require physical activity include going to a central location to retrieve mail, get coffee, or pick up lunch. social norms can be used as \u2018anchors\u2019 to influence behaviour. framing physical activity as fun, rather than obligatory, could also affect people's likelihood to engage in physical activity. research has begun to examine how design features affect dietary intake. large plates, portions and packages influence people to consume more. small-scale environmental features such as plate size can be modified to mitigate over-consumption. stress and anxiety cannot be excluded as factors affecting the well-being of people in cities because prolonged exposure to cortisol can lead to physical chronic diseases like stress-induced hypertension. physiological and psychological stressors have the capacity to influence mental health both at the individual level (e.g. individuals' perception of the environment) and through neighbourhood effects (e.g. the experience of neighbourhood walkability and state of maintenance and upkeep) 'take notice' considers the benefits of mindfulness and paying attention to the present as a way to reduce the symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. the availability of diverse open public spaces, the high density of mixed-use development that encourage walking and cycling can be linked to the positive effects of the physical and social environment on mental health. a variety of moderators or \u2018effect modifiers\u2019 influence the valence and strength of the impact of the environment on human health and health-related behaviours. this notion is illustrated by Evans et al.\u2019s findings [59] that architectural depth moderates the effect of crowding on mental health. zoos, biomedical research and agriculture have been impacted by the interaction between the built environment and chronic stress. built structures that facilitate social interaction reduce stress because grooming in primates and ungulates alleviates stress through the release of -endorphins. housing conditions of research animals may influence their physiology, thus biasing the results of scientific studies. honeybees store nectar in the form of honey, and pollen for protein, at specific locations in their hive [78]. these food stores can ensure colony survival during the winter months, when there are no flowers [79]. Spider webs and beaver dams are structures that assist animals in collecting food [80], thus potentially reducing long-term nutritional deficiencies. built structures that facilitate social interaction reduce stress because grooming in primates and ungulates alleviates stress through the release of -endorphins. housing conditions of rhesus macaques can influence their social environment, elevating their stress levels if they are housed alone, which can bias the results of biomedical research. physical activity may not necessarily promote long or healthy lives in non-human animals. in social insects, queens that are long-lived (more than 30 years in some species) are extremely sedentary, compared to workers who are very mobile, yet short-lived (mostly up to 1 year) different age- and dementia-friendly design strategies for urban and architectural spaces have been developed under the common theme of \u2018ageing in place\u2019 or \u2018lifetime neighbourhoods\u2019. dementia-friendly designs target the critical issues such as ease of wayfinding by proposing environments familiar, legible, distinctive, accessible, comfortable and safe. the possibilities of caring through design for individuals with chronic disease such as cancer have been explored at the architectural scale of healthcare institutions. a well-known example are Maggie's Centres, which were established with the idea that psycho-social interventions increase patients' chances of living longer. nature improves attentional capacity and the ability to cope effectively. the natural environment engages involuntary attention and allows the mechanism underlying directed attention to rest and recover. the natural environment engages involuntary attention and allows the mechanism underlying directed attention to rest. health-promoting and health-deterring neighbourhood features are correlated with race and socio-economic status of communities. wealthier neighbourhoods are more likely to have supermarkets and gas stations with convenience stores compared to poor neighbourhoods. in black neighbourhoods, the availability of chain supermarkets was 52% of what it was in white neighbourhoods. different age- and dementia-friendly design strategies for urban and architectural spaces have been developed under the common theme of \u2018ageing in place\u2019 or \u2018lifetime neighbourhoods\u2019. guiding principle behind these strategies is supporting active and independent involvement in local communities to maintain health and manage existing long-term conditions in older individuals. biophilic design emphasizes the necessity of maintaining, enhancing and restoring the beneficial experience of nature in the built environment [94] for people with disease diagnoses, nature can enhance their capacity to cope effectively. this work suggests that we have two types of attention: effortful \u2018directed\u2019 attention and \u2018involuntary\u2019 attention that is captured easily and effortlessly. nature in the space refers to the presence and diversity of natural elements and environmental conditions within the built environment. natural analogues refer to objects, materials and shapes that evoke nature. low-income and ethnic minority populations are more likely than 'whites' to experience a variety of adverse health outcomes. in new york, playgrounds in low-income neighbourhoods are more likely to have hazards like paint chips, trash, rot, rust, splinters and vandalism [106,107]. in Baltimore, Maryland, while blacks are more likely to live within walking distance of a park, those parks are more likely to be hazardous or polluted, and are typically smaller than those to which Whites have access. environmental justice issues must be addressed to distribute healthy, safe, nurturing environments across the population. need for shelter can create socially facultative structures in animals that would not be social otherwise. yellow-bellied marmots rely on burrows for wintering and for escaping from predators, thus forming facultative social structures. Interestingly, individuals in larger groups express higher levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites, an indicator of stress. contagious diseases have been the direct cause for changes in the fields of urban planning and architecture since the mid-nineteenth century. the hygienist agenda was embraced in the early twentieth century as one of the postulates of modernism. modern architecture has produced a specific set of spatial typologies with assumed therapeutic and prevention effects. architects and urban designers have historically applied similar strategies for dealing with infectious diseases, whether through prevention or finding ways to contain the epidemics' spread. the legacy of modernist hygienist ideas for prevention of epidemics can be seen in contemporary sanitary approaches to designing indoor environmental climate. environmental factors such as indoor air quality (e.g. air pollution, odours, fresh air supply and ventilation), lighting quality (e.g. view and illuminance), thermal comfort (e.g. view and the 'transparency project' documents substances such as arsenic, phthalates and volatile organic components, and their associated health risks. a recent study of citizens in Barcelona found a link between urban air pollution and an increase in cases of depression and anxiety. ants use resin from coniferous trees as nesting material. wood rats place California bay foliage in their nests to reduce parasite load. ant species secrete antimicrobial compounds onto their nest walls to prevent the growth of harmful microbes. study of the mechanisms underlying the \u2018undertaking\u2019 hygienic behaviour in honeybees has revealed complex gene regulation [145] and uncovered which neurotransmitters are associated with this task [146] leaf cutter ant species that live in wet environments will dig special waste chambers inside their nest. leaf cutter ant species from arid environments will dispose of their waste outside the nest. non-synchronous crevice use in the Gidgee skink results in more frequent transmission of pathogens than direct social interactions. pygmy bluetongue lizards occupy burrows built by spiders and their choice of which burrow to occupy and how frequently to move between burrows can impact their parasite load. ant species preferentially select nest sites with fungi [166] or with dead ants that are visibly infected with fungi [167 studies of how population densities influence disease prevalence provide some insights into how built structures may affect disease transmission. a common argument in the social insect literature is that the high density of social insects inside their nests puts them at risk of rapidly transmitting infectious diseases. the physical environment of cities has either provided or eliminated favourable conditions for many infectious diseases. unplanned urban expansion, such as slums, has brought about problems of inadequate sanitation, allowing the spread of water-borne diseases and creating breeding sites for various disease vectors. modes of social interaction and of disease spread both impact the number of infected individuals. the nature of social contacts can be close, e.g. individual contacts that happen at home, in workplace and in social situations with friends, or casual, e.g. occasional contacts at service places. in their model, they used architectural distances measured between workstations to model contact networks as directly dependent on the spatial layout of the building. the main aim of disease dynamics models is to identify critical infection points and propose effective mitigation strategies either to prevent disease outbreaks. self-grooming is more likely to contain a disease and allogrooming is more likely to facilitate disease spread. removing diseased or dead individuals from built structures is common in the animal world. removing diseased or dead individuals from built structures is common in the animal world, especially in social insects. large-scale containment effort to reduce tuberculosis in cattle in the uk has been to cull badgers, which are a vector for the disease. spatial arrangement of badger populations and dispersal of healthy individuals led to faster spread of disease instead of its containment. hygienist ideas for prevention of epidemics can be seen in contemporary sanitary approaches to designing indoor environmental climate. environmental factors such as indoor air quality (e.g. air pollution, odours, fresh air supply and ventilation), lighting quality (e.g. view and illuminance), thermal comfort (e.g. view and illuminance), thermal comfort (e.g. view and illuminance) and acoustical quality (e.g. noise from outside and a study of citizens in Barcelona found a link between urban air pollution and an increase in cases of depression and anxiety. a new \u2018living fa\u00e7ade\u2019 system uses plants and other organisms to absorb the pollutants of the city and purify the air. environmental factors such as indoor air quality (e.g. air pollution, odours, fresh air supply and ventilation), thermal comfort (e.g. view and illuminance), thermal comfort (e.g. view and illuminance), thermal comfort (e.g. moisture and temperature) and acoustical quality (e.g. noise from outside and indoors) are measured and controlled for their effects on the three systems of the human body. contemporary building standards take into account the different modes of a recent study of citizens in Barcelona found a link between urban air pollution and an increase in cases of depression and anxiety. a new \u2018living fa\u00e7ade\u2019 system uses plants and other organisms to absorb the pollutants of the city and purify the air. urban spaces are being transformed into allergy- and asthma-free environments. wood ants use resin from coniferous trees as nesting material. resin inhibits the growth of bacteria and fungi and enhances survival of the nest's inhabitants. honeybees incorporate resin from plants into the wax that forms their hive. leaf cutter ant species that live in wet environments will dig special waste chambers inside their nest. leaf cutter ant species from arid environments will dispose of their waste outside the nest. sanitary behaviours in animals include the use of latrines to concentrate excretions in one or a few locations inside or outside the nest. individuals that move frequently between burrows are more likely to encounter and transmit a parasitic nematode [162] ant species preferentially choose nest sites with fungi [166], or with dead ants that are visibly infected with fungi [167], over clean, empty nests. a low-dose exposure to such pathogens results in immunity during later encounters with it. a common argument in the social insect literature is that the high density of social insects inside their nests puts them at risk of rapidly transmitting infectious diseases within the nest. however, such disease spread is seldom seen, leading to the development of many hypotheses about how social insects achieve \u2018social immunity\u2019 [172,173] or \u2018organizational immunity\u2019 [174]. honeybees and many ant species remove dead individuals from nest. hygienic behaviour extends lives of remaining colony members. ants and bees can detect diseased individuals and behave aggressively towards them. animals can avoid locations that have either been exposed to pathogens or show evidence of disease. non-synchronous crevice use in the Gidgee skink results in more frequent transmission of pathogens than direct social interactions. behaviours and habitat preference of parasites may play a critical role in where they are found and how likely they are to persist inside a host's burrow. structure design Animals may create structures that influence direct interactions that facilitate disease transmission between individuals. if an infection begins at a single location, it will take longer to reach everyone in a group housed in a compartmentalized structure. however, other models show that spatial structures have only a small impact on disease transmission. higher population density affects transmission speed of diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis, that rely on direct contact and proximity. rural-to-urban migrations and worldwide travel have also led to an increased risk of epidemics. urban expansion has brought about problems of inadequate sanitation, allowing the spread of water-borne diseases and creating breeding sites for various disease vectors. a major challenge for epidemiology models lies in identifying and mapping the overlap between the social, behavioural and spatial factors that enable the transmission of disease. the nature of social contacts can be close, e.g. individual contacts that happen at home, in workplace and in social situations with friends. a promising approach for incorporating architectural and organizational data into large-scale epidemic forecasting models was proposed by Potter et al. [189] in their model, they used architectural distances measured between workstations to model contact networks as directly dependent on the spatial layout of the building. the main aim of disease dynamics models is to identify critical infection points and propose effective mitigation strategies to prevent disease outbreaks. a major challenge for epidemiology models lies in identifying and mapping the overlap between social, behavioural and spatial factors that enable the transmission of disease. the nature of social contacts can be close, e.g. individual contacts that happen at home, in workplace and in social situations with friends, or casual, e.g. occasional contacts at service places. a promising approach for incorporating architectural and organizational data into large-scale epidemic forecasting models was proposed by Potter et al.
