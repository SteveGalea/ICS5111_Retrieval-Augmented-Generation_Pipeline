{"summary": "the most common chronic respiratory diseases are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), affecting around 300 million and 65 million people worldwide. the main cause of exacerbations is infection with respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza. this review will discuss the roles of the MAPK pathways in these processes. a group of proteins known as dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) and MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) have roles in many different processes, with severe implications in airway disease. JAK1 and Tyk2 phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2 which dimerize, translocate to the nucleus and bind IRF9, forming ISGF3. pyridinyl imidazole compounds inhibit p38 by competing with ATP for its binding site, blocking its catalytic activity. inhibition of p38 in primary bronchial epithelial cells reduced mRNA production of IL-1 and TNF- in response to RSV infection. the ERK pathway also has roles in cytokine induction in epithelial cells in response to viral infection. one study showed weaker production and release of CXCL8 in response to infection with two strains of rhinovirus. interferons limit replication of respiratory viruses; pre-treatment of airway epithelial cells with interferon- (IFN-) significantly reduced replication of rhinovirus or influenza virus. the MAPK pathways have previously been implicated in interferon induction in response to influenza infection. virus replication occurs within the nucleus, forming viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. inhibition of either p38 or ERK was found to decrease influenza virus replication in MDCK cells due to a reduction in vRNP export from the nucleus [49,50,51] ia in the airway epithelium by fusing the membranes of neighbor cells, leading to cytosol mixing and viral transfer. p38 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate guanyl-nucelotide dissociation inhibitor. p38 has been shown to activate guanyl-nucelotide dissociation inhibitor. the literature suggests that respiratory viruses hijack the MAPKs and their downstream targets for their own ends. this highlights the need for strict regulation of these pathways. the MAPKs and mucus production A defining feature of asthma and COPD is goblet cell hyperplasia and excessive mucus production. mucin MUC2 is raised in ovalbumin murine models of asthma. treatment with p38 inhibitors decreases release of IL-33 in response to RSV infection. p38 is also shown to repress IL-33 production in primary nasal epithelial cells. regulation of the MAPK pathways by DUSPs is of extreme importance. these pathways are inactivated by simultaneous dephosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues within the MAPK activation motif by dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) DUSP1 is present in the nucleus and dephosphorylates all three MAPKs. poly(I:C) is a ligand for the PRRs toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which are predominantly activated by viral infection. a similar role for DUSP1 was seen in infection of the NCI-H1299 cell line with the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. DUSP1 knock down in hepatocyte cell lines increasing STAT1 activation in the effects of DUSP1 knock down on the interferon response to hepatitis C infection may be indirect effects of increased MAPK activation (Section 2.1) rather than direct inactivation by DUSP1. the inflammatory cytokine TNF- is induced by respiratory viral infection, with higher expression in asthmatic patients. DUSP10 in primary bronchial epithelial cells increased the release of the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL8 and CXCL1 in response to stimulation with a key proinflammatory cytokine IL-1. this suggests that DUSP10 negatively regulates the inflammatory response in the airway. DUSP10 knock down primary bronchial epithelial cells from both healthy and COPD donors. DUSP10 knock out mice showed greater disease severity than wild-type mice. this was associated with increased lung injury and pulmonary edema. BMDMs isolated from these mice had elevated activation of p38 and JNK. this was associated with augmented neutrophil influx in the lungs. pyridinyl imidazole compounds inhibit p38 by competing with ATP for its binding site, blocking its catalytic activity [26] Griego et al. used two pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors to examine the role of p38 in cytokine and chemokine production by the BEAS-2B human bronchial cell line in response to infection with rhinovirus [27] the ERK pathway also has roles in cytokine induction in epithelial cells in response to viral infection. one study showed weaker production and release of CXCL8 in response to infection with two strains of rhinovirus in primary bronchial epithelial cells treated with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 [28] interferons limit replication of respiratory viruses; pre-treatment of airway epithelial cells with interferon- significantly reduced replication of rhinovirus or influenza virus. a gene expression array compared the response of primary HUVECs infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses with and without SB202190, a p38 inhibitor. inhibition of either p38 or ERK was found to decrease influenza virus replication in MDCK cells due to a reduction in vRNP export from the nucleus. in both cases, this was thought to be due to impaired transport of viral proteins through the secretory pathway. in both cases, this was thought to be due to impaired transport of viral proteins through the secretory pathway. ERK has previously been implicated in syncytia formation in cancer. inhibition of ERK in epithelial cell lines reduced Arp2/3 recruitment. syncytia formation in syncytia formation in syncytia formation. the literature suggests respiratory viruses hijack the MAPKs and their downstream targets for their own ends. p38 activation of Rab protein cycling may facilitate viral replication. this highlights the need for strict regulation of these pathways, in order to limit viral replication. IL-33 levels are higher in the lungs of RAW-infected mice, leading to enhanced production of IL-13. inhibition of p38 has also been shown to repress IL-33 production in primary nasal epithelial cells in response to TNF- stimulation. another mechanism by which mucin production is upregulated is via activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. regulation of the MAPK pathways is of extreme importance. these pathways are inactivated by simultaneous dephosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues within the MAPK activation motif by DUSPs. PRR recognition of viruses or viral components activates the MAPK and IRF3 pathways. poly(I:C) is a ligand for the PRRs toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which are predominantly activated by viral infection. a similar role for DUSP1 was seen in infection of the NCI-H1299 cell line with the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. inflammatory cytokine TNF- is induced by respiratory viral infection. elicits secondary inflammatory cytokine release from airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. DUSP1 knock down of DUSP10 in primary bronchial epithelial cells increased mRNA and protein expression. DUSP10 knock out mice infected with influenza had elevated levels of IL-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) than wild-type mice. DUSP10 knock out mice also had decreased viral titres and better survival in response to infection. BMDMs isolated from these mice had elevated activation of p38 and JNK, and to a lesser extent ERK, in response to LPS treatment. this was associated with increased lung inflammation in response to intratracheal LPS injection. DUSP10 has an anti-inflammatory role in the airway and is important in limiting immune-mediated lung damage. DUSP1 (MKP1) is a nuclear protein capable of dephosphorylating p38, JNK and ERK. it has been characterized as an early response gene, with undetectable expression at baseline. the airway epithelial cell line NCI-H292 upregulates DUSP1 mRNA within one hour. DUSP1 knock down in hepatocyte cell lines increased STAT1 activation in response to hepatitis C virus or IFN- stimulation. a yeast two-hybrid assay was unable to find an interaction between DUSP1 and STAT1. the effects of DUSP1 knock down on the interferon response to hepatitis C infection may be indirect effects of increased MAPK activation. DUSP10/MKP5 DUSP10 (MKP5) is expressed ubiquitously in the nucleus and cytoplasm [99] and is upregulated in response to viral infection. Knock down of DUSP10 in primary bronchial epithelial cells increased the release of the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL8 and CXCL1 in response to stimulation with a key proinflammatory cytokine IL-1. DUSP10 knock down primary DUSP10 and IRF3 directly interact, indicating IRF3 as a novel substrate for DUSP10. DUSP10 knock out mice showed greater disease severity than wild-type mice. this was associated with increased lung injury and pulmonary edema. DMs from these mice produced lower levels of inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS injection. this was associated with reduced activation of p38 and JNK. but increased activation of ERK in response to LPS. p38 inhibitors have been used to confirm roles for these pathways in TSLP production in ASM cells in response to TNF- or IL-1 stimulation. p38 inhibitors have also been used to confirm roles for these pathways in TSLP production in ASM cells in response to TNF- or IL-1 stimulation. early infection with RSV has been linked to the development of asthma, possibly through skewing the immune response towards a Th2 phenotype. DUSP1 knock out dendritic cells had increased activation of p38. this led to impaired priming of nave wild-type T cells. DUSP1 knock out T cells exhibit reduced proliferation in response to activation with anti-CD3 antibodies. DUSP10 knock out mice have decreased numbers of virus specific CD4+ cells. these mice also have diminished CD4+ cell proliferation in response to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. DUSP4 negatively regulates Treg cell differentiation through inactivating STAT5 [123] mice with a DUSP16 knock out specifically in the hematopoietic compartment produce increased levels of IFN- and diminished IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in response to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. mice with a DUSP16 knock out specifically in the hematopoietic compartment do not display altered Th1 or Th2 responses, but demonstrate a role for the protein in regulating IL-2 production. DUSP22 was found to dephosphorylate Lck on Tyr394, inactivating it. further downstream of ZAP-70, TAB1 is activated by PKC-. TAB1 binds to TAK1, inducing conformational change. knock out dendritic cells exhibit reduced proliferation in response to activation with anti-CD3 antibodies and lower levels of IFN- and IL-17, Th1 and Th17 cytokines. DUSP10 plays a role in T cell proliferation and function. DUSP10 knock out mice have decreased numbers of virus specific CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells in the lung in response to influenza infection. however, T cell effector functions were increased, with greater levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokine release. DUSP4 negatively regulates Treg cell differentiation through inactivating STAT5 [123] mice with a DUSP16 knock out specifically in the hematopoietic compartment do not display altered Th1 or Th2 responses, but demonstrate a role for the protein in regulating IL-2 production. IL-2 has previously been shown to inhibit the expansion of Th17 cells. DUSPs have also been found to regulate T cell receptor signaling. DUSP1 binds to TAK1, inducing conformational change, triggering the IKK, p38 and JNK pathways. HEK293T cells were transfected with wild-type or non-functional mutant DUSP14. levels of activated Lck and ZAP-70 were unchanged between cells expressing wild-type and mutated DUSP14. BMDMs or peritoneal macrophages isolated from DUSP1 knock out mice show this was due to impaired inhibition of MAPK activation. this was diminished in peritoneal macrophages isolated from DUSP1 knock out mice in response to alternative macrophage activators IL-4 and IL-13. this was diminished in peritoneal macrophages isolated from DUSP1 knock out mice. bronchial biopsies from steroid-sensitive asthmatics show a reduction in JNK activation after treatment with dexamethasone. this was associated with reduced expression of DUSP1 in response to dexamethasone. lower expression of DUSP1 was also found in peripheral blood neutrophils from steroid-resistant asthmatics. polymorphisms in the DUSP1 gene have been associated with steroid responsiveness. bronchodilators, such as 2-recpetor agonists, also have anti-inflammatory effects. treatment of cells with 2-agonists increases intracellular levels of cAMP. sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disorder, often characterized by granulomas within the lung. altered expression and activation of p38 and inflammatory cytokine production were higher in cells isolated from patients. this coincided with much lower DUSP1 protein expression in controls than sarcoidosis patients. a single nucleotide polymorphism in the DUSP4 gene was identified in a genetic screen for variants associated with severe asthma. this was not statistically significant, possibly due to the limited number of patients in the study. studies examining the relationship of other DUSPs and asthma would be of interest and are yet to be carried out. future work into airway roles is imperative."}
