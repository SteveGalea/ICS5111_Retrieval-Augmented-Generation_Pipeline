CHERG only used data from inpatient studies published between 1990 and 2011. we have done an extensive search of the literature to include the 286 inpatient studies used in our estimates. GBD has not published the studies included, their search strategy, or modeling methods. we will not be able to completely compare these estimates. potential selection bias in studies searching for only one enteropathogen is not taken into consideration when estimating causes of diarrheal deaths. future studies should be done in hospital services dealing with all types of severe diarrhea, searching for all known enteropathogens, removing the effect of asymptomatic excretes. title 17 U.S.C. 101 defines a U.S. Government work as a work prepared by a military service member or employees of the U.S. Government as part of those persons' official duties.
