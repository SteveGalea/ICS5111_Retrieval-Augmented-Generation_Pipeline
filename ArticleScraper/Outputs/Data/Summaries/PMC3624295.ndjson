{"summary": "in 1997, Hong Kong reported the first human outbreak of H5N1 influenza, which caused six deaths. since 2003, H5N1 viruses have spread across Asia and into Europe and Africa (2). HA protein is primed for membrane fusion activity by posttranslational cleavage of the HA0 precursor into the fusion-capable HA1-HA2 complex (11) intracellular furin-like proteases can cleave the polybasic cleavage sites of some H5 and H7 HA proteins. the HA surface glycoprotein binds sialic acid-containing receptors on the surface of the host cell. a limited sampling of H5N1 influenza virus isolates, the HA activation pH has been measured to range from 5.3 to 5.9. mutations that alter the HA activation pH have been associated with changes in virulence in mice. the highest levels of replication and pathogenesis appear to correlate with HA activation pH values that range between 5.6 and 6.0. the wild-type (WT) virus selected for the present study was A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/04 (H5N1), a clade 1 influenza virus that has avian-virus-like receptor binding specificity. the virus does not cause weight loss, death, transmission (either contact or airborne), systemic spread, or robust nasal shedding in ferrets. the results for infection in a mammalian model can be compared to those obtained for infection in an avian model. the C58 HA-Y231H mutant virus is attenuated for replication and pathogenesis in mice, just as it was in ducks. the C58 HA-K582I mutant virus promoted high levels of replication in the lungs and pathogenesis in mice. all experiments with HPAI H5N1 influenza virus were conducted before the moratorium on avian influenza virus transmission research (35). biosafety and biosecurity were performed in an enhanced animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL-3+) laboratory that is select agent approved and routinely inspected by both institutional biosafety and USDA officials. multiple-step growth kinetics of the WT and mutant viruses were determined in the following cell lines: MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney), A549 (CCL-185, human lung carcinoma), NHBE (normal human bronchial epithelium), DF1 (CRL-12203, chicken embryo fibroblast), and CCL-141 (duck embryo fibroblast). cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 1.6 106 EID50 in 50 l is the highest concentration we could attain with our virus stock. animals having signs of severe illness or more than 25% weight loss were euthanized for humane reasons. aliquots were stored at 80\u00b0C until further use. all work with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus was performed in an enhanced animal biosafety level 3 laboratory. the facility has entry and exit access control with both a card scanner and a biometric fingerprint reader. staff are required to shower upon exit and comply with a quarantine policy to prevent outside contact with birds. cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/BMBL.pdf meets or exceeds all standards outlined in biosafety in microbiological and biomedical Laboratories. multiple-step growth kinetics of the WT and mutant viruses were determined in the following cell lines. mice had signs of severe illness or more than 25% weight loss were euthanized for humane reasons. titers were expressed as EID50/ml calculated by the Reed and Muench method. in vitro replication kinetics of reverse genetic C58 WT and mutant viruses. mutant viruses containing activation pH-lowering mutations HA-H241Q and HA-K582I had reduced growth. mutant virus containing activation pH-increasing mutation HA-Y231H had significantly reduced replication rates in two avian-derived cell lines. HA-Y231H and HA-H241Q mutant viruses had replication kinetics that were not statistically significantly different. in NHBE cells, all four viruses grew at relatively similar rates. HA-Y231H, with an increased activation pH, reduces the virulence of the C58 H5N1 strain in C57BL/6J mice. HA proteins that have activation pH values of 5.9 (WT) and 5.6 (HA-H241Q) but not by an HA protein that has an activation pH value of 6.3 (HA-Y231H) or 5.4 (HA-K582I) (26). all of the C57BL/6J mice inoculated with the HA-Y231H mutant survived. the animals did not suffer substantial weight loss compared to a group mock inoculated with PBS. HA-K582I mutation lowered the activation pH to 5.4 and eliminated virulence in mallards. we inoculated groups of DBA/2J mice intranasally with 50 l of PBS containing 2.8 104 EID50 of WT or mutant C58 virus. we then monitored the mice for weight loss and survival for 17 days. the pH of HA activation influences the growth of the C58 H5N1 strain in the murine respiratory tract. we intranasally inoculated groups of DBA/2J mice with 50 l of PBS containing 2.8 104 EID50 (1 MLD50) of virus. none of the viruses grew to high levels (>103 EID50/ml) the ratio above each bar represents the number of mice with detectable virus titers divided by the total number of infected mice. the average virus titer and percentage of virus positivity after 2 and 7 days of infection were substantially lower in the lungs. the HA-K582I mutant virus grew in the nasal cavities to an average peak titer of 103 EID50/ml. the rank order of C58 virus growth in the respiratory tracts of mice was HA-Y231H (activation pH, 6.3) WT (activation pH, 5.9) HA-H241Q (activation pH, 5.6) HA-K582I (activation pH, 5.4) the virus was more resistant to acid inactivation than the HA-Y231H mutant was. the HA-H241Q and HA-K582I mutant viruses did not lose infectivity after exposure to pH 6.0. after incubation at pHs 5.5 and 5.0, the mutant viruses retained slightly more infectivity (1 log10) than the WT virus. -K582I (activation pH, 5.4) had single- and multistep replication kinetics in MDCK cells similar to those of the WT C58 virus (activation pH, 5.9) despite the two mutant viruses having reduced growth and earlier clearance in the trachea and cloaca of mallards (26). the mutant virus containing the activation pH-lowering mutation HA-Y231H had significantly reduced replication rates in the two avian-derived cell lines. the virus with the HA-K582I mutation and the lowest activation pH had significantly lower titers between 12 and 36 h after infection. the HA-Y231H mutation, which raised the activation pH to 5.6, did not produce attenuation in any of the cell lines tested. HA-Y231H, with an increased activation pH, reduces the virulence of the C58 strain H5N1 viruses in mallards. we inoculated groups of C57BL/6J mice intranasally with 50 l of PBS containing 1.6 106 EID50 of WT or mutant C58 virus. all (100%) of the C57BL/6J mice inoculated with this relatively high dose of WT C58 virus survived the infection and ence of the HA-K582I mutant virus in C57BL/6J mice was largely similar to that of the WT. the mutant virus caused a slightly lesser extent (12%) and delay (by 1 day) of weight loss and recovery. however, the animals did not suffer substantial weight loss compared to a group mock inoculated with PBS. 57BL/6J strain of mice with the C58 strain viruses resulted in relatively low levels of weight loss even at a high dose. we inoculated groups of DBA/2J mice intranasally with 50 l of PBS containing 2.8 104 EID50 of WT or mutant C58 virus. we then monitored the mice for weight loss and survival for 17 days. intranasal inoculation with 28,000 EID50 of reverse genetic C58 WT and mutant viruses. pH of HA activation influences the growth of the avian C58 H5N1 strain in the murine respiratory tract. titers of reverse genetic C58 WT and mutant viruses grew to similarly low levels. the ratio above each bar represents the number of mice with detectable virus titers divided by the total number of infected mice. the dotted horizontal line indicates the assay detection limit (TCID50/ml = 1 log10). the HA-K582I mutant virus grew in the nasal cavities to an average peak titer of 103 EID50/ml. the rank order of C58 virus growth in the respiratory tracts of DBA/2J mice was HA-Y231H (activation pH, 6.3) HA-H241Q (activation pH, 5.6) HA-K582I (activation pH, 5.4) Y231H mutant virus's infectivity was reduced by >10-fold after exposure to pH 6.0 buffer, reduced by >100-fold after exposure to pH 5.5 buffer, and completely eliminated by pH 5.0 buffer. similar to the WT virus, the HA-H241Q and HA-K582I mutant viruses did not lose infectivity after exposure to pH 6.0. compared to the WT C58 HA protein, the Y231H, H241Q, and K582I mutant HA proteins have been previously shown to be activated at pHs 6.3, 5.6, and 5.4 respectively. a decrease in pH of activation of the HA protein supports the adaptation of an avian H5N1 influenza virus to a mammalian host. an HA protein with an activation pH of 6.3 may be too unstable to support efficient replication in vivo, consistent with the activation pH values of HA proteins from diverse influenza virus subtypes. both viruses grow to similar levels in mice, ducks, and cell cultures derived from both avian and mammalian hosts. virulence in mice compared to those of the HA-K582I mutant virus. the mutant virus is activated at pH 5.9 in duck and chicken embryo fibroblasts. the increased fitness of the HA-K582I mutant virus in mice may be due in part to a small, but perhaps biologically important, increase in its resistance to inactivation. introduction of the previously described HA-K582I mutation (26, 27) into a live attenuated (with NS1 deleted) H5N1 vaccine candidate was shown to lower the HA activation pH to 5.3, lower the 50% mouse infective dose by 25-fold, and induce greater systemic and mucosal antibody responses in mice. a mutation in the fusion peptide of the HA protein from HPAI A/Netherlands/219/03 (H7N7) has been shown to decrease the HA activation pH from 5.4 to 4.4 and simultaneously reduce virulence and virus growth in mice. the adaptation of low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) to the lungs of mice led to the discovery of several HA mutations that increase the pH of hemolysis from in both cases, after receptor-binding specificity was switched from (2,3) to (2,6) and a glycosylation site was deleted, a final mutation required for airborne transmission in ferrets was one that has been directly shown to decrease the HA activation pH. we believe that the C58 HA-K582I mutant virus does not increase the risk of H5N1 influenza virus to human health for several reasons. the virulence of the C58 HA-K582I mutant virus in mice is weaker than naturally occurring H5N1 viruses. the mutant viruses were not actively adapted during animal experiments and tissues were destroyed after titers were measured. the final mutation required for the acquisition of airborne transmissibility in ferrets was an HA-T3181I mutation that lowered the HA activation pH from 5.8 to 5.6. a decrease in the HA activation pH (from 5.9 to 5.4) supports H5 influenza virus growth in a mammalian model while it has a deleterious effect on H5 growth in avian species (25, 26). this work assists surveillance by identifying individual mutations and specific HA activation pH values that promote adaptation to mammals. many enveloped viruses invade cells after their fusion glycoprotein is triggered by a low pH. this work also has implications for viral infectious diseases in general."}
