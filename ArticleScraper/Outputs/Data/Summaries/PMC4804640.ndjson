{"summary": "the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first discovered in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a man suffering from an acute respiratory distress syndrome (Zaki et al., 2012; de Groot et al., 2013). since then, 1611 confirmed cases with 575 fatalities have been reported (as of October 2015; http://www.who.int/csr/don/29-october-2015-mers-saudi-arabia/en a recent study showed binding of bat CoV HKU4 spike protein to the MERS-CoV receptor human dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) supporting a bat origin of MERS-CoV. a large portion of patients, especially those with severe illness, had some underlying condition such as diabetes or chronic renal disease. SARS-CoV has been shown to infect macrophages and DCs. the infection is abortive and does not result in detectable viral protein synthesis or production of progeny viral particles. both viruses showed efficient replication on Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells. no increase was seen in macrophages or MDDCs, whereas strong expression of N protein was observed in Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells. E6 cells were infected at m.o.i. 0.1, and A549 and Calu-3 cells at m.o.i. 1. qRT-PCR analysis was carried out to quantify MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viral RNA. in macrophages, MERS-CoV infection resulted in increased levels of IFN-1 and CXCL10 mRNAs at the 6 h time point. in SARS-CoV-infected MDDCs, induction of CXCL10 and MxA was observed at the 6 and 24 h time points coupled with some induction of IFN- and IFN-1 at the 6 h time point. total cellular RNA was isolated, and levels of (a) IFN-, (b) IFN-1, (c) CXCL10, (d) TNF- and (e) MxA mRNAs were determined by qRT-PCR. values were normalized to 18S rRNA levels. mERS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-induced cytokine and MxA gene expression in human Calu-3 cells. cells were left uninfected or infected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV at m.o.i. 1. cells were collected at 1, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Western blot analysis of MxA from cell lysates revealed high expression in MERS-CoV-infected macrophages and a more modest expression in MDDCs. cells primed with macrophage and MDDC supernatants from the infection experiments were the only cells to show a statistically significant reduction in influenza A virus M1 RNA expression levels. a quantitative assay was set up to investigate differences in DPP4 expression. DPP4 expression was expressed at similar levels in macrophages and MDDCs. almost no DPP4 mRNA expression was detected in A549 cells. supernatant and cell lysate samples from infected cells were analysed by end-point dilution and quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR. no evidence of effective replication of MERS-CoV was observed in either cell type, with viral RNA levels remaining the same, decreasing or increasing only weakly throughout the infection. cell lysate and cell culture supernatant samples were collected at 1, 6, 24 and 48 h post-infection. qRT-PCR analysis was carried out to quantify MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viral RNA in infected macrophages. cell lysates from MDDC, macrophage, Calu-3 and Vero E6 infection experiments were analysed by Western blotting for expression of actin, MxA or MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV N protein. the 1 h sample and 1/5 diluted 48 h sample were included as positive controls in the MDDC/macrophage Western blots. induction of innate immune response genes by MERS-CoV was weak. no significant difference between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV was detected. in A549 cells, no induction of cytokine and MxA genes was seen. human MDDCs were left uninfected or infected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV or influenza A virus strain A/Beijing/89 (H3N2) at m.o.i. 1. Cells were collected at 1, 6, 24 and 48 h after infection. values were normalized to 18S rRNA levels. RNAs were determined by qRT-PCR. values were normalized to 18S rRNA levels. gene expression data are presented as relative fold induction of gene expression in relation to uninfected samples. a expression in macrophages at the 24 h time point, but no expression in MDDCs was detected. cells primed with macrophage and MDDC supernatants from the infection experiments were the only cells to show a statistically significant reduction in influenza A virus M1 RNA expression levels. no DPP4 mRNA expression was detected in all tested cell types. a549 cells showed the lowest DPP4 expression levels. qRT-PCR was used to quantify level of DPP4 expression. FN-1, CXCL10 and MxA mRNAs induced strong CXCL10 protein expression. lack of MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 on cell surface would explain lack of mERS-CoV receptor cleavage. overexpression of TMPRSS2 or furin has been shown to increase host cell susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection. the range of proteases expressed by a cell appears to be one of the determinants of host cell tropism. however, our stock viruses are expected to be highly infectious. despite a lack of efficient replication, MERS-CoV infection was associated with some induction of IFN-, IFN-1, CXCL10 and MxA mRNAs in macrophages and MDDCs. this induction may still be significant considering the lack of replication. the first study to report on MxA gene expression in macrophages and MDDCs. in Calu-3 cells, MERS-CoV infection resulted in only modest expression. however, no IFN-1 and TNF- production was seen despite strong mRNA induction. this highlights the importance of verifying gene expression data. MERS-CoV ORF4b protein inhibits IFN signalling by interfering with STAT1 activation. the structural M and N proteins and several non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV are also involved in blocking type I IFN production. IFN-mediated antiviral state might explain the clinical outcome of the MERS-CoV infection. the severe infections are more restricted to patients with other underlying clinical conditions as compared with SARS-CoV infections. MDDCs were maintained in RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 0.6 g penicillin ml 1, 60 g streptomycin ml 1 and 10 ng human granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor ml 1. three different donors were used for macrophages and MDDCs. natant samples were collected at 1, 6, 24 and 48 h post-infection followed by PBS wash, lysing of the cells into either RLT-buffer or passive lysis buffer (Promega) and pooling of lysates from different donors. RNA isolation and qRT-PCR Total cellular RNA was isolated from the cell lysates using a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. dilution series up to 10 8 was made for each sample and used to infect cells on 96-well plates with eight infected wells for each dilution. the wells were observed for cytopathic effect under a light microscope. western blot analysis Protein concentrations of cell lysates in passive lysis buffer were measured by the Bradford method. equal amounts of proteins (10 g of total protein per lane) were loaded and separated on 12 % SDS-PAGE. adult human blood used in the experiments was obtained from anonymous healthy blood donors through the Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. cells and viruses MERS-CoV (GenBank accession number JX869059) and SARS-CoV (HKU-39849) were provided by the Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam, The Netherlands) A549 (ATCC CCL-185), Vero (ATCC CCL-81), Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) and Calu-3 (ATCC HTB-55) cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.6 g penicillin ml 1, 60 g streptomycin ml 1, 2 mM l-glutamine, 20 mM HEPES, 10 % FCS (Sigma supernatant samples were taken at 1, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-infection. RNA isolation and qRT-PCR Total cellular RNA was isolated from the cell lysates using a RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) a dilution series up to 10 8 was made for each sample. wells were infected on 96-well plates with eight infected wells for each dilution. results were calculated using the Spearman\u2013Karber method. a dilution series of plasmid pcDNA3.1(+)-human DPP4 was generated. samples containing 300 000, 30 000, 3000, 300 and 30 copies of the gene were analysed. ELISA IFN-1 levels from cell supernatants were analysed using a human interferon."}
