{"summary": "the human gastrointestinal (GI) flora contains 1014 microorganisms. most of these microbes are symbiotic to the human host. GI microbiota also contains enteric viruses, including bacteriophages. culture-based methods are insufficient for large-scale characterization of the viral community in the human GI tract. in addition, viruses do not have ubiquitously conserved genetic elements such as rDNA that can be used as diversity and evolutionary distance markers [15]. cDNA was used to construct a shotgun library for sequencing analysis. of the total 36,769 sequences, 33,643 (91.5%) were similar to known sequences in the GenBank nr database based on tBLASTx (e-value 0.001). the most abundant virus in the fecal RNA viral libraries was pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV) the most abundant virus in the fecal RNA viral libraries was pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV), which infects all species in the genus Capsicum. a family of RNA viruses with bisegmented genomes is present in humans and animals. the other animal virus identified (Moloney murine leukemia virus) was only represented by two clones. the diversity and dynamics of the RNA viral community in human feces was quite small in terms of the types of viral species. oat blue dwarf virus and grapevine asteroid mosaic-associated virus were the second and third most abundant viruses in Lib 1 but were undetectable in Lib 2. differences most likely reflect fluctuations in the fecal RNA viral community of a single individual over time. the two fecal samples from the same individual represented distinct genogroups. they were aligned to the partial genome sequence of PBV strain 4-GA-91 using BLASTn. identities of nucleotide sequence between the contigs and the reference PBV sequence were 95%\u201399%. feces-borne PMMV sequences were very divergent and represented novel PMMV variants. similar results were observed for other viral species. a region of 101 bp in the PMMV CP gene was chosen for sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. a total of 44 assembled sequences (>50 bp) from the three fecal virus libraries were located within this region. sequences from Lib 1 are highlighted in pink, Lib 2 in blue, and Lib 3 in yellow. lane 1 was detected by RT-PCR using PMMV specific primers in a fecal RNA extract. this PMMV band is PMMV primer-specific (lane 2) and dependent on reverse transcription (lane 3). the specificity of the RT-PCR reaction for detecting fecal PMMV was further assessed by the use of nonspecific PCR primers. three pairs of food-fecal samples from three healthy individuals were collected for total RNA extraction. for each sample pair, small aliquots were taken from all the foods consumed by the participants for 2 d prior to the time of feces collection. the virus copy number was in range of 106\u2013109 per gram of dry feces. the presence of PMMV in feces is not geographically restricted. the presence of PMMV in feces is not geographically restricted. the presence of PMMV in feces is not geographically restricted. RNA extracts from uninfected control leaves and PMMV-positive fecal supernatant challenged leaves were tested for PMMV by RT-PCR. samples 1 and 2 were from the same individual, with a gap of 6 mo between the sample collections. the presence of ribosomal RNA-like sequences may reflect the copurification of some ribosomes with the virions from the fecal extracts. the number of sequences related to yeast viruses and bacteriophages in these libraries was insignificant, with only one and seven clones matching them. a total of 21,838 sequences were mapped across the entire genome of PMMV (6,357 bp) the levels of sequence homology to the PMMV reference genome sequence were highly variable. 24 out of 35 plant viruses detected in these fecal samples were known pathogens of consumable crops including fruits, vegetables, tobaccos, and cereals. PMMV, oat blue dwarf virus, and grapevine asteroid mosaic-associated virus were the top three species represented by 80%, 13.6%, and 3.0% of the 9,961 virus-like clones. in Lib 2, PMMV (75.7%), PBV (8%), maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV, 7.7%), oat chlorotic stunt virus (OCSV, 2.9%), panicum mosaic virus (PanMV, 1.8%), and tobacco mosaic virus (1.3%) were the two prototypes are 28% at the nucleotide level and 40% at the amino acids level. the five contigs from 27 PBV-like sequences from Lib 1 were highly similar to the conserved PBV strain 4-GA-91. the 26 contigs from 701 PBV-like sequences from Lib 2 were only marginally homologous (46%\u201369% homology at the amino acid level) the largest PMMV contig was 3,158 bp in length and contained 1,817 clones. the largest PMMV contig was 3,158 bp in length and contained 1,817 clones. a complete fecal PMMV genome could still not be assembled de novo. the first 101 bp of the 474-bp CP gene (from 5,685 to 6,158 bp of the PMMV genome) had the most sequences mapping to it. the previously known PMMV CP gene sequences were found mostly in three clusters (clusters I, II, and III) in the human population to confirm the presence of the viruses identified through shotgun library sequencing, we used RT-PCR to detect these viruses directly from the fecal samples used for library construction. we then extended the test for the five most abundant viruses identified in lib 2 (PMMV, MCMV, PBV, OCSV, and PanMV; see Table 2). the estimated number of virions in 1 g of dry food and feces was 1.21 106 (lane 1), 2.3 107 (lane 2), 1.63 107 (lane 3), 3.64 109 (lane 4), 2.42 107 (lane 5), and 1.95 108 (lane 6) as determined by TaqMan RT-PCR. the positive control is shown in lane 7. feces were enriched 20-fold (Figure 4D; lane 2 versus 1), 224-fold (lane 4 versus 3), and 8-fold (lane 6 versus 5) in pairwise comparisons with food. differences in enrichment of PMMV might reflect different levels of reduction and condensation of mass from food to feces through absorption during digestion in different individuals and at different times. samples from food stalls in Singapore were tested; four of these chili sauces contained PMMV. they demonstrate that food is a potential source of PMMV in human feces. we then assessed if the feces-borne PMMV viruses were viable and able to infect host plants. in mucosal cells were undetectable in stools from healthy individuals. but are abundantly shed into feces in inflammatory conditions when symptoms develop. analysis of fecal samples from diarrhea patients would be the logical extension of this study to identify unknown pathogenic human enteric viruses. fecal PMMV appeared to be significantly higher than the virus load found in food based on equal dry weight. this increase could be a result of the digestive reduction of food, or viral replication in the human gut. further research efforts are needed to determine whether and how plant viruses may interact with intestinal cells or microorganisms. fecal samples from two healthy adults were collected for RNA viral isolation and sequencing analysis. samples 1 and 2 were from the same individual with a gap of 6 mo between sample collections. six fecal samples were collected from six people living in the same building. ecal matter was resuspended in 5 l of SM buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 10 mM MgSO4) the viral particles were then concentrated on a 100-kDa tangential flow filter (Amersham Biosciences) the viral concentrates were stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) and visualized using epifluorescent microscopy oligo sequences were amplified by PCR using forward primers TaqI-F and Csp6I-F. DNA fragments between 500 and 1,000 bp were fractionated and cloned into TOPO PCR cloning vectors. phylogenetic analysis of PMMV sequences The PMMV CP gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. from the three libraries, 44 assembled fecal PMMV sequence segments were aligned within the first 101 bp of the 474 bp CP gene. treeView (Win32) was used to generate the phylogram tree (http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod.html). samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min to sediment particulate matter. the supernatant was subjected to nucleic acid extraction using the Qiagen viral RNA Mini kit. RT products (1/10 of total reaction) were used as templates for PCR reactions. PCR reactions were carried out in an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) the RT reaction was performed at 48 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by 10 min at 95 \u00b0C for activation of DNA polymerase. negative controls (RT-less and RNA-less) and serial dilutions of positive control (a plasmid clone) were included in every PCR assay. six fecal samples were collected from six healthy humans in the same building. nine fecal samples were collected from nine individuals living in the same building. food intake of participants was documented over a period of 3 d prior to sample donation. Viral RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNA/DNA Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) the sample was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h to remove any contamination by free nucleic acids. double-stranded cDNA was divided into two aliquots. high-quality sequences for all three libraries were searched for homology against the nonredundant nucleotide database (nr) in GenBank using tBLASTx [44,45] based on the best tBLASTx hit, virus-like sequences were further classified based on hosts, such as plant, animal, or bacterial origins. fecal PMMV sequence segments were aligned within the first 101 bp of the 474 bp CP gene. treeView (Win32) was used to generate the phylogram tree. RT-PCR detection of fecally borne RNA viruses. all RT-PCR tests included RNA-less and RT-less samples as negative controls. food samples were subject to the same procedure for RNA extraction and RT-PCR detection of PMMV. two leaves per plant were inoculated with 2 l of sample supernatant/ground glass mixture. leaves that developed viral symptoms were collected for RNA extraction and viral detection by RT-PCR and subsequent sequencing analysis."}
