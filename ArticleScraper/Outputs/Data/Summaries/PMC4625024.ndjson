{"summary": "the global burden of typhoid has been estimated at 21.7 million infections annually with 217,000 deaths. development of resistance to currently available antibiotics has led to a push for increased vaccine usage. there are two vaccines currently on the market, first a live attenuated S. Typhi strain (Ty21a) that is administered orally, and secondly a Vi polysaccharide subunit. bacteria travel through the gut associated lymphoid tissue to either the mesenteric lymph nodes (PP) or directly to the bloodstream by uptake into macrophages, polymorphonuclear phagocytes (PMNs) and dendritic cells (DCs) the bacteria travel through the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) to either the spleen and liver where the bacteria multiply, forming multiple focal lesions. low-virulence challenges with S. Typhimurium are controlled by the innate immune system (phagocytes and cytokines). virulent challenges require both early innate responses (macrophages and TNF-, IL-12, IFN- and NK cells) and antibodies and T-cells, which must be primed by immunisation or previous exposure to a sub-lethal infection. the aim of this study is to determine the effect that different vaccination methods have on immune stimulation and protection from secondary infection in the typhoid mouse model. we have characterised the growth and clearance of the vaccine strain after both IV and oral vaccination, as well as shedding of the vaccine strain, and survival post challenge. Bacteria from 500ml culture were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes. resuspended in 800l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a concentration of 1011 cfu/ml. inoculum counts were confirmed by plating on LB agar. organs (spleen, liver mesenteric lymph node and peyer\u2019s patches) were collected aseptically. 5ml PBS was added to each sample and samples were homogenised using a Stomacher 80. the number of viable bacteria per 100mg of faeces was quantified by plating serial dilutions of tissue homogenates on LB agar containing streptomycin. ELISA 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 50l/well S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10g/ml) in PBS. plates were then washed three times with PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) and serial dilutions of serum samples were added to a total volume of 50l/well. ELISA plates were incubated with subclassing antibodies for 1 hour at 37C. unbound antibody was removed by washing plates 10 times in PBST. bound subclassing reagents were then detected by adding 100l of goat anti-rat antibody to each well. mice were vaccinated either orally (n = 26) or intravenously (n = 27) at days 7, 14, 28, 42 and 70 five or six mice were sacrificed from each group. bacterial loads in the spleen, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer\u2019s patches were quantified as described above. survival Mice were vaccinated either orally (n = 8) or intravenously (n = 7) as described above. at 10 weeks post vaccination all mice were challenged with virulent strain of S. Typhimurium. mice were monitored for signs of severe morbidity (greater than 15% weightloss combined with other acute signs of Salmonella infection) survival data was recorded for analysis. mice were anesthetised using Penthrane and euthanised by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. oral vaccination with S. Typhimurium BRD509 was used as the vaccine strain in all immunisation experiments. virulent S. Typhimurium 10ml LB was subcultured with 50l of an overnight culture of S. Typhimurium SL1344 wildtype (wt) Bacteria were diluted in PBS to 5 x 107 cfu/ml. bacterial counts were confirmed by plating on LB agar. ELISA sample collection\u2013faeces Faecal pellets were collected. pellets were soaked for 1hr on ice, shaken vigorously for 5mins. then centrifuged for 15mins at 13,000rpm. the supernatant was removed to a fresh 1.5ml tube and stored at -20\u00b0C. plates were developed using 50l Immunopure o-Phenylenediamine (OPD) with H2O2 as substrate. after 10\u201315 minutes incubation in the dark, the reaction was stopped using 50l 2N H2SO4. endpoint titres were designated as the reciprocal of the dilution of specific antibody. samples were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature in the dark then washed with 150l of wash buffer and centrifuged at 200xg for 5 minutes. the supernatant was discarded and samples were resuspended in 80l of wash buffer and analysed on a BD FACSCalibur. experimental design The effects of different vaccination techniques were examined in a series of three experiments that compared the performance of live vaccines. survival Mice were vaccinated either orally (n = 8) or intravenously (n = 9) as described above or left unvaccinated (n = 9) at 10 weeks post vaccination all mice were challenged with a virulent strain of S. Typhimurium as described above. at days 7, 14, 28, 42 and 70 five or six mice were sacrificed from each group. blood samples were collected for faecal bacterial loads and faecal IgA quantification by ELISA. survival Mice were vaccinated either orally (n = 5) or intravenously (n = 5) as described above or left unvaccinated (n = 9) at 10 weeks post vaccination all mice were challenged with a virulent strain of S. Typhimurium as described above. bacterial counts from organs were analysed by ANOVA. non-parametric tests were performed for cytokine production. survival analysis post challenge was performed using the Kaplan-Meier survival platform.

IL-10 and IL-12 were undetectable in almost all mice. only some IV vaccinated mice had detectable TNF- levels at day 14. but TNF- was detectable in the serum of all IV vaccinated mice at day 28. oral vaccination resulted in reduced colonisation following a virulent challenge. but unlike in the systemic organs, IV vaccination did not lead to a significant reduction in colonisation of these organs compared to unvaccinated mice. mice were either orally vaccinated with 1010 BRD509 () or IV vaccinated with 102 BRD509 () 10 weeks prior to challenge or unvaccinated () data are representative of two experiments. both IV and oral vaccination increased the survival of mice compared to the unvaccinated group. 2.904 0.0001 Day post vaccination c 58.749 0.0001 102.000 0.0001 3.286 0.0195 12.397 0.0001 Interaction (Vacc x Day) d 1.010 0.4127 4.980 0.0022 8.563 0.0001 16.755 0.0001 a dfbetween-groups = 9, dfwithin-groups = 43 b dfbetween-groups = 1, dfwithin-groups = 43 vaccine strain resulted in colonisation of the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and the peyer\u2019s patches (PP) intravenous administration rarely resulted in bacteria in these tissues. faecal shedding of the vaccine strain was never observed after IV administration. orally vaccinated mice mounted a Salmonella-specific IgG response more rapidly than IV vaccinated mice with significantly higher IgG levels in the serum of orally vaccinated mice. by six weeks post vaccination, both methods elicited a comparable anti-LPS serum IgG antibody response. data are expressed as log10 reciprocal titres. dashed grey and black lines represent the means for the IV and oral groups respectively. boxplots display medians, IQRs and the complete spread of data. faecal IgA was detected in all orally vaccinated mice by 21 days post vaccination. IL-10 and IL-12 were undetectable in almost all mice at both 14 and 28 days post-vaccination. mice vaccinated intravenously show the highest level of TNF- at day 14 and then a large reduction in TNF- by day 28. in mice vaccinated intravenously, TNF- was only detected in two of five mice at day 14. from this experiment it is not possible to say if oral vaccination stimulates a greater TNF- response. both oral and oral vaccination resulted in significant reduction in colonisation by SL1344, with no significant difference between the methods. survival Both methods of vaccination resulted in an increased survival following challenge with virulent S. Typhimurium compared with unvaccinated mice. the most obvious difference in immune response detected in this study is induction of specific secretory IgA (SIgA) in orally, but not IV vaccinated mice. this is consistent with studies showing that colonisation of the PP and MLN is required for the induction of a secretory IgA response. immunised pIgR-/- mice show similar protection against secondary colonisation of the gut-associated organs as C57BL/6 mice. the delay in development of a serum IgG response in IV vaccinated mice compared with orally vaccinated mice. however, the delay in development of a serum IgG response in the systemic organs did not result in greater induction of specific antibody. the difference in the ability of both the vaccination strain and the secondary challenge strains to colonise the gut in IV and orally vaccinated mice has significant implications for the health of others in the population. the colonisation of the gut and the resulting shedding of the vaccine strain from orally vaccinated mice increases the potential for transmission of the vaccine strain to other individuals. two vaccines may be equally capable of controlling an infection. this does not mean that they are of equal merit for use as control mechanisms in populations. implications of these differences for infection dynamics are unknown."}
