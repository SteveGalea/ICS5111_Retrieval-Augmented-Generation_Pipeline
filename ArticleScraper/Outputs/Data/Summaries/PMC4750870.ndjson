{"summary": "bats (Order Chiroptera) have been found to be a primary reservoir for numerous recent zoonoses of global concern. bats comprise one of the most diverse and ecologically important groups of mammals, with 1,200 species, accounting for almost a quarter of mammal diversity worldwide. this possible \u201cuniqueness\u201d of bats to harbor viral pathogens has led to an increased interest in understanding viral diversity. we analyze data from 93 peer-reviewed papers from 2007\u20132013 using generalized linear mixed models. we identify the study-level variables most important for efficient viral discovery, such as specimen type, number of bats sampled, assays used, and bat and viral taxonomy. we explore possible routes of viral shedding and prevalence levels by viral family. papers included host identification to at least the species level, sample types tested, virus detection methods used, and viral identification of positive results at least to the family level. previous generation sequencing (NGS) studies excluded in all but one instance due to lack of necessary information being reported. in three cases, the number of individual bats that tested positive for a virus was not reported. multiple specimens were positive in multiple species [17\u201319]. in these cases, we assumed an equal distribution of positive individuals across species. contextual clues were used to assume whether they were or were not sacrificed. a negative binomial regression was the best fit for our count data. the total number of individual bats in a study was excluded from the model due to its covariance with the number of bat species (r = 0.70, p0.0001) and the number of specimens tested (r = 0.92, p0.0001). lethally (vs. non-lethally) sampled per study N_Specimens

specimen was sacrificed (yes/no) Virus. all molecular data were aggregated to produce boxplots and heat maps. heat maps were clustered by similarities in viral richness by row and column. 93 primary studies included in this analysis using our selection criteria. next generation sequencing (NGS) studies were excluded in all but one instance due to lack of necessary information being reported. the number of individual bats that tested positive for a virus was not reported. experimental infection studies were excluded, as were book chapters and articles in languages other than English. number of bats was not explicitly stated but organ tissue specimens were taken, the total number of bats was assumed to be the total number of specimens [20\u201324] contextual clues were used to assume whether the animals were sacrificed unless explicitly stated that organ biopsies were non-lethal. the total number of individual bats in a study was excluded from the model due to its covariance with the number of bat species (r = 0.70, p0.0001) and the number of specimens tested (r = 0.92, p0.0001) Explanatory variables included in the full study-level model were: number of species tested, proportion of bats sacrificed, number of total specimens in the study, and number of viral families tested in the study. model variables included: specimen type (blood, feces, tissue, urine, saliva, other), detection method (molecular, serology, histopathology, other), whether the specimen was sacrificed (yes/no), host taxonomy (Family), viral taxonomy (family), number of individual bats, and number of total specimens tested. bats from 17 families, 110 genera, and 340 species were sampled for viral discovery across 93 studies. a total of 1,891/19,237 (9.83%) specimens were positive by serological assays, and 3,452/155,231 (22.22%) were positive by PCR assays. a wide variance in the number of bat species examined and viral families tested per study. the best-fit GLMMs for predicting how many novel and total viruses would be found in a given study included, in order of importance, number of species in the study, number of viral families tested. the fitted model predicted that the lower the proportion of bats sacrificed, the higher the number of total viruses found (0.63, 95% CI 0.39\u20131.02, p = 0.0657) Specimens + ViralFamiliesTest 223.79 86.51 55 53.44 51 N_spp + Prop_Sacrificed +

period were detected in host families that are also the most species rich. the greatest number of viruses over the study period were detected in host families that are also the most species rich. the number of bat viruses discovered over time has increased. the number of viruses discovered over time has increased, and 250 novel viruses were discovered over the study period. however, we identify significant surveillance biases over this period. we excluded all but one of these studies from our current analyses. we believe closer examination of NGS studies used for bat pathogen discovery warrants a separate analysis. we also observed a decline in the use of serology and viral isolation. study-level regression analyses suggest future viral discovery efforts would be most productive if focused on testing a broader array of bat species and viral families. both the proportion of bats sacrificed and the number of specimens examined both dropped out of the final fitted model. this suggests that viral discovery efforts will be maximized by including more species of bats, instead of (or in addition to) more specimens of individuals from the same bat species. ovirus studies we examined did not attempt to screen non-lethally collected bat excreta. this points to a non-lethal specimen type that may be productive for Filovirus detection and discovery in the future. global efforts that have adopted these methods for wildlife viral discovery may find success in their efforts. we found inconsistencies in methodologies and reporting that would have improved the power of our analysis. several studies mentioned only the number of bats sampled or the number of specimens taken, not both. also found that identification of bats to the species, or even genus, level was often incomplete. more detailed analysis of viral discovery by tissue type may lead to better understanding of tissue tropism for certain viral families. more detailed analysis of viral discovery by tissue type may lead to better understanding of tissue tropism for certain viral families. prevalence by viral family and sample type can be used to design statistically valid field investigations. we acknowledge a key caveat in our estimate of the number of novel viruses found over the study period. if two separate studies examine non-homologous gene regions for a given virus, these studies may be 'double counting' the existing known number of viruses. the number of bat viruses discovered over time has increased. the number of viruses discovered over time has increased, and 250 novel viruses were discovered over the study period. but we identify significant surveillance biases over this period. only five viral families were detected using serology (out of six tested) compared to 20 out of 22 viral families using molecular detection techniques. serological testing to detect certain viruses in bats would help inform disease dynamics in natural populations of bats. the proportion of bats sacrificed and the number of specimens examined both dropped out of the final fitted model when both the number of total and novel viruses were used as response variables. this suggests that viral discovery efforts will be maximized by including more species of bats, instead of (or in addition to) more specimens of individuals from the same bat species. the use of recently developed protocols for non-lethal sampling for pathogen discovery may be valuable. global efforts that have adopted these methods for wildlife viral discovery may find success in their efforts. targeted and sometimes lethal sampling approaches may be justified and more effective depending on the pathogen in question or the research question. we found that identification of bats to the species, or even genus, level was often incomplete\u2013highlighting the need for virologists to collaborate better with bat taxonomic experts and those with extensive field experience. after closer investigation all but one pair of studies that used duplicate samples examined different viral families. more detailed analysis of viral discovery by tissue type may lead to better knowledge of tissue tropism for certain viral families. there is a dearth of information for more than half of the 24 viral families as to what specimen type may be most likely to yield viral detection. this bias will only be fixed with more targeted efforts in the field and laboratory to address these surveillance gaps. the designation of 'novel' for each virus discovered was based on small gene fragments and phylogenetic analysis conducted by individual authors and the peer reviewed system at the time of publication. if two separate studies examine non-homologous gene regions for a given virus, these studies may be \u2018double counting\u2019 the existing known number of viruses.
