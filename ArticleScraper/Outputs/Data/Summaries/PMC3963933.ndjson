{"summary": "mammalian reoviruses (MRVs) are prototypical members of the family Reoviridae. they contain segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses of both medical (rotavirus) and economic (bluetongue virus) importance. these viruses have a segmented dsRNA genome encoding eight structural proteins and three nonstructural proteins. three other reovirus strains, designated BLD, JP, and BYL, were isolated from other SARS patients [20]. all four SARS-MRV strains were purified by plaque assay and identified as novel members of serotype 2 by sequence analysis of their S1 segments [21] suckling mice intracranially inoculated with BYD1 display signs of central nerve damage, myocarditis, and pneumonia. the potential of viral proteins 1 and 1 to induce apoptosis could be associated with multi-organ injuries in vivo. the fragments were purified with a QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (NE Biolabs), according to manufacturer's specifications. a kanamycin-resistant clone was isolated and the pEGFP-C\u20131 plasmid was purified and sequenced. apoptosis of 293 T cells was quantified using an Annexin-V FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit. cells were washed once with PBS, triedpsinized, washed twice with PBS. samples were then added to 300 l of binding buffer. the use of mice in the study was approved by the animal care and use committee at the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology. the use of mice in the study was approved by the animal care and use committee at the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology. the vector pEGFP-C\u20131 was constructed in a similar manner using primers sigma1f and sigma1r. the plasmids were purified with an endotoxin-free plasmid purification kit (Qiagen) 293 T cells were transfected with pEGFP-C3, pEGFP-C\u20131 or pEGFP-C\u20131 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) d once with PBS, trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, and quantified. cells were resuspended in 200 l of binding buffer and treated with 10 l of fluorescein isothiocyanate. samples were then added to 300 l of binding buffer. we characterized the ultrastructural cytopathology of Hep-2 cells infected with SARS-MRV strain BYD1. cells undergoing various stages of apoptosis were easily observed with electron microscopy. this finding that BYD1 infection triggers cell apoptosis is consistent with the established fact that reoviruses induce apoptosis in vitro. reassortant reoviruses identified the 1-encoding M2 gene segment as the primary determinant of strain-specific differences in reovirus-induced apoptosis [25], [18], [26]. ectopic expression of full-length 1 indicated that the 1 protein is essential for apoptosis [17], [18], [26]. electron microscopic analysis at 48 h posttransfection confirmed the presence of ultrastructural changes characteristic of apoptosis. early apoptotic cells with chromatin condensation and late apoptotic cells with ruptured nuclei were observed in the cells expressing GFP\u20131 or GFP\u20131. multi-organ lesions in suckling mice infected with reovirus T3D causes injury to a variety of organs, including the central nervous system (CNS), heart, and liver. the mice infected with BYD1 showed symptoms of neurological disease, including heavy breathing, lethargy, and unresponsiveness to external stimulation. the mice were then euthanized, and their organs were examined with H&E staining on day 8 following intracranial viral in histopathological evaluation of multiple tissues from mock-infected (A\u2013H) and BYD1-infected (a\u2013h) suckling mice. micrographs show representative examples of H&E-stained tissues evaluated eight days postinfection at 200 magnification. apoptosis is consistent with the established fact that reoviruses induce apoptosis in vitro. apoptosis is consistent with the established fact that reoviruses induce apoptosis. the full-length genes encoding BYD1 1 and 1 were cloned into the expression vector pEGFP-C3 fused to the C-terminal of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence. 293 T cells were transfected with vectors expressing GFP alone or the GFP-tagged proteins, and were examined with phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy. oscopic images of 293 T cells 48 h after transfection with pEGFP-C3 (B), pEGFP-C3\u20131 (C\u2013D) or pEGFP-C3\u20131 (E\u2013F) identified apoptotic cells with early chromatin condensation (C, E) and late karyorrhexis (D, F), bar = 2 m (E) or 5 m (B, C, D, F) mice infected with BYD1 showed symptoms of neurological disease at one week postinfection. the mice were then euthanized and their organs were examined with H&E staining on day 8 following intracranial viral inoculation. results suggest a preference of BYD1 for the pallium and hippocampus. apoptosis has been accorded an important role in the pathogenesis of some viral infectious diseases. apoptosis has also been suggested to play a pathogenic role. reovirus is not recognized as an important human pathogen, but significant human diseases have been attributed to reovirus infection. ectopic expression of reovirus 1 mimics reovirus-induced apoptosis in terms of activation of initiator caspases 8 and 9 and release of cytochrome c and smac/DIABLO from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. however, the same group also found that the ectopic expression of 1 derived from the relatively nonapoptogenic T1L and apoptogenic T3D reovirus strains previous studies in guinea-pig and nonhuman primate models support a pathogenic role for SARS-MRV in SARS. this is consistent with the CNS-directed virulence of other reovirus strains. if SARS-MRV is involved in damaging the CNS of SARS patients has never been examined."}
