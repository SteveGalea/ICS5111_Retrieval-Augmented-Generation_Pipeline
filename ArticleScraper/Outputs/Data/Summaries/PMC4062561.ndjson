{"summary": "hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) covers a wide array of related diseases including HLH, familial erythrophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, viral-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, and autoimmune-associated macrophage activation syndrome. the term primary HLH refers to an underlying genetic abnormality causing the disorder, whereas secondary HLH indicates that the disorder is secondary to HLH is characterized by defective cytotoxic cell function, unbridled macrophage activity, leading to excessive cytokine production, subsequent immune dysregulation, and tissue damage. long-term survival in 1983 was estimated to be as low as 4%. triglycerides are secondary to decreased lipoprotein lipase activity initiated by increased TNF- levels. Elevated ferritin is believed to accumulate during the anti-inflammatory process of macrophage scavenging of heme via the CD163 receptor. high concentrations of soluble IL-2 receptor are produced by activated lymphocytes. ated sCD25 90% Percentage not found in secondary HLH literature >2,400 U/mL LDH 40%\u201345% 100% 500 U/L ALT 30%\u201335% Percentage not found in secondary HLH literature 100 U/L Bilirubin 30% Percentage not found in secondary HLH literature 34 mol/L CSF cells 35%\u201340% Percentage not found in secondary HLH literature 5/L CSF protein 45% Percentage not found in secondary HL the hepatomegaly, elevated transaminases, and bilirubin are believed to be the direct result of organ infiltration by lymphocytes and histiocytes. despite the fact that hemophagocytosis is prominently featured in this disease, it is rarely found at presentation in secondary cases. a rapid flow cytometric analysis of intracellular X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) has been developed for detection for X-linked lymphoproliferative disease and carrier state. CD107 may serve as a surrogate marker for reduced or absent NK-cell and cytotoxic T-cell activity. the pathophysiology of HLH seems to be useful as a quick and reliable marker for perforin gene mutations seen in HLH. four of seven patients with EBV showed lack of intracellular perforin in all cytotoxic cell types. the parents of these patients also had abnormal perforin staining. sporadic and familial cases of HLH can be initiated by infectious causes. however, it is important to distinguish between primary, genetic cases versus secondary, as treatment of the latter may be attempted. the majority of HLH-associated cases have been reported in Asia. the higher rates of EBV-associated HLH in Asian countries may be due to a more pathogenic strain of EBV. studies have performed sequence analysis of the EBV nuclear antigen 2 gene and latent membrane protein-1 (lmp-1) this studies have demonstrated that no single sub-strain of EBV has been linked to HLH. ae Adenovirus Primary adenovirus pneumonia and a case of adenovirus infection after bone marrow transplant60,61 Parvoviridae Parvovirus B19 Complication of treatment for hematologic malignancy and post-solid organ transplant48,57,62\u201365 Herpesviridae Herpes simplex virus Infected neonates and a pregnant woman66,67 HHV-8 Immunosuppressed children and also adults co-inf the most common bacterial infections associated with HLH are given in Table 3.

Perforin is found in secretory granules of cytotoxic cells and plays an important role in apoptosis and immune modulation. et al.230 patients with disruptive mutations presented at a younger age than FHL-3 patients with missense mutations. the gene mutation causing FHL-5 was described as recently as 2009 by Zur Stadt et al and also by C\u00f4te et al. treatment involves immune-suppressive and modulatory agents, biological response modifiers, and treatment of the inciting illness if secondary. therapy involves suppressing the hyperinflammatory state and immune dysregulation that leads to life-threatening organ damage and susceptibility to deadly infections. treatment of HLH may vary according to cause. HSCT was recommended for all children with a suitable allogeneic donor. supportive care may have included an intensive care unit stay, broad-spectrum antibiotics until appropriate culture results were available, and microbiological surveillance. HLH-2004 essentially took HLH-94 and moved cyclosporine from later in the regimen to an initial therapy, concurrent with dexamethasone and VP-16. intrathecal methotrexate was still included for select patients with CNS involvement. case which resolve or are non-genetic can cease therapy unless relapse occurs. the Stephan study evaluated six patients and was successful in achieving remission quickly. the regimen was used to treat 38 consecutive patients with FHL over the course of 14 years. the patients received 45 courses of ATG, with a total dosage of 50 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg varying by severity of disease. most cases of infection-related HLH should be treated aggressively with standard HLH protocols. etoposide appears to interfere with EBV-induced lymphocyte transformation. despite its potential risks, the benefits of etoposide justify its early use. etoposide-based regimens such as HLH-94 and HLH-2004 can be used in MAS. in 1994, the Histiocyte Society proposed the first protocol for the treatment of HLH (HLH-94) the protocol began in 1994, 5 years before genetic markers for FHL were found. 114 (46%) died, and 72 did not receive transplant. of patients with long-term follow-up, 64 (89%) occurred in the first year. HLH-94 achieved complete remission or allowed survival to HSCT. dexamethasone and VP-16 dosing were the same as in HLH-94. intrathecal methotrexate was still included for select patients with CNS involvement. cases which resolve or are non-genetic can cease therapy unless relapse occurs. methylprednisolone at 4 mg/kg/day was administered with the ATG for 5 days then tapered. patients received supportive care with fibrinogen infusions, irradiated packed red blood cells, and platelets. CSA was added to reach a plasma concentration of 150 ng/mL prior to HSCT. etoposide appears to interfere with EBV-induced lymphocyte transformation. despite its potential risks, the benefits of etoposide justify its early use. despite its potential risks, the benefits of etoposide justify its early use in light of the fact that even seemingly mild cases may deteriorate quickly. study of 86 children treated with HLH-94 followed by HSCT showed similar long-term disease-free survival (70% at 3 years) with matched donor transplants or mismatched unrelated transplants showed much less favorable results with long-term disease-free survival of only 50%. surviving to HSCT have an approximate survival rate of 92%. despite advances in treatment regimens, up to 25% of children with HLH cannot undergo HSCT due to advancing disease. salvage therapies have been described in various case reports but few large studies. etanercept, a TNF inhibitor, was used with success in a patient with acute lupus hemophagocytic syndrome. 178 case reports have elaborated on treatment of refractory cases with splenectomy270 and even liver transplant for the damage caused by the unbridled macrophage activity."}
