{"summary": "exemplary theories of alcoholism derived from human and animal studies. these theories involve mechanisms of disinhibition, reward, habit formation, stress, and inflammation. findings from animal models that have either helped in the development or aided in the support of these theories. mice administered alcohol spend more time in open areas than mice not exposed. disinhibition is associated with damage to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and its subcortical connections. neuronal loss in the frontal association cortex has been reported only when alcohol exposure protocol included bouts of thiamine deficiency. alcoholics appear to have either innate or acquired behaviors characterized psychologically as disinhibition. only humans show evidence of tissue shrinkage as well as atrophy in prefrontal cortical regions as a consequence of chronic alcohol exposure. ergic interneurons (G) input to a pyramidal neuron in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) the wave is accentuated and rhythmic in the resting EEG of alcoholics. the wave is accentuated and rhythmic in the resting EEG of alcoholics. a distinct distribution of receptors or differing subunit expression across species could lead to variations in the brain\u2019s function at the molecular, cellular, and electrophysiological levels. a distinct distribution of receptors or differing subunit expression across species could lead to variations in the brain\u2019s function at the molecular, cellular, and electrophysiological levels. postmortem studies support this finding, showing neuronal loss. MRI also reveals significant volume deficits of the cerebellum of alcoholics. lower neuronal counts have been observed in the cerebellum of the rat brain chronically exposed to alcohol. the relationship between the degree of cerebellar damage and cognitive functioning in alcoholics has not been unequivocally established. the theory that frontocerebellar degradation contributes to the cognitive sequelae of alcoholism warrants further investigation. the cerebellum as a whole is disproportionately enlarged in humans and nonhuman primates compared with lower species. a large body of research on alcohol addiction has focused on the mesolimbic dopaminergic system (e.g., Brodie et al. 1990) dopamine neurons in the ventral striatum play a key role in this circuitry inextricably linked to the concept of reward. an increase in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is associated with the presence of a rewarding stimulus such as food. release may be three- to fivefold higher in response to alcohol, at least in acute stages. -opioid receptor activation hyperpolarizes (i.e., suppresses or inactivates) GABAergic interneurons in the VTA, thereby releasing dopaminergic neurons from spontaneous inhibition. increased dopamine release also has been measured using an electrophysiological technique known as patch-clamp recording. more \u201ceffective\u201d receptors may be associated with innate deficits in dopamine levels. the subregional topography of the dopamine transporter has been shown to be inconsistent across species. this transition may be the result of a complex interchange between executive and habit systems. several types of classical conditioning/implicit learning paradigms have been shown to be critically dependent on selective cerebellar sites. the amygdala is another brain structure implicated in habit formation. it plays a role in emotional regulation and behavioral control. a silent period elapses between the occurrence of the conditioned stimulus and the delivery of the unconditioned stimulus. MRI provides in vivo evidence for volume deficits in the anterior hippocampus of chronic alcoholic individuals. alcohol does not appear to have an effect on the number of hippocampal neurons, per se. both the striatum and the cerebellum have been shown to participate in the automatization process during the late learning stage of a repeated visuomotor sequence (Doyon et al. 1997) and of a sequence of finger movements (Doyon et al. 1998). yet the collaborative contributions of the striatum, cerebellum, amygdala, and hippocampus to the formation of an alcohol consumption habit have yet to be demonstrated. a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the CRF gene conferred a decreased sensitivity of the CRF promoter to corticosteroid regulation in vitro. monkeys with this polymorphism tended to be more exploratory and exhibited increased alcohol consumption compared with the monkeys in which this single nucleotide was unmodified. the link between the body\u2019s response to stress and alcohol is complex. one theory states that people continue to self-administer alcohol even after the rewarding effects of alcohol are blunted. the mechanisms behind this negative reinforcement are believed to involve an extensive extrahypothalamic CRF system centered on the extended amygdala. glucocorticoid receptors act as nuclear transcription factors. glucocorticoid receptors act as nuclear transcription factors. early life stress in a species that exhibits low glucocorticoid receptor expression in infancy could be less harmful than early life stress in a species that exhibits high glucocorticoid receptor expression. the brain\u2019s immune defense cells respond by activating central proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin 1 [IL1] and TNF), which in turn can stimulate microglia to produce monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1, Qin et al. 2007). increased MCP-1 observed in brain tissue could directly cause neuronal damage and thus could be one of the mechanisms contributing to alcohol-related neuronal loss and brain atrophy. ination, loss of myelinated fibers, and axonal deletions also observed. in dogs exposed to alcohol for 1 year, fewer glial cells were found in the temporal and frontal cortices compared with control animals. neuroinflammation appears to be a likely mechanism of harm to this constituent of the brain. a causal relationship between alcohol-induced neuroinflammation and alcohol-induced suppression of neurogenesis has yet to be established. a causal relationship between alcohol-induced neuroinflammation and alcohol-induced suppression of neurogenesis has yet to be established. there have been few studies designed to specifically test the hypothesis. the majority of shrinkage with drinking does not necessarily reflect \u201cneuronal loss\u201d. the controlled longitudinal imaging studies demonstrating volume reductions likely reflect nonneuronal loss. this increase predicts improvement in neuropsychological test performance. the class of behaviors associated with executive dysfunction has a common psychological mechanism. disinhibition describes the behavior of individuals who exhibit a limited capacity to edit or manage their immediate impulsive response to a situation or are poorly motivated to do so. postmortem evaluation of the canine brain after 1 year of alcohol exposure did not reveal statistically significant differences in frontal cortical thickness or neuron population compared with unexposed animals. in the rat, neuronal damage has been observed in several cortical regions (e.g., entorhinal, insular, piriform, and perirhinal cortices) after administration of alcohol. a feline model was the first to provide evidence that alcohol modifies GABAA receptor function. alcohol (given at doses associated with human intoxication) rapidly and reversibly enhanced GABAA and its receptor activity. this enhancement was specific to GABA, as the effect was not observed with glycine, dopamine, or serotonin. the association between a GABAA receptor variant, the wave, and disinhibited behavior in alcoholics clearly demonstrates the unique relationship between the brain\u2019s structure and function. animal models have been vital in helping to better understand this relationship. a distinct distribution of receptors or differing subunit expression across species could lead to variations in the brain\u2019s function at the molecular, cellular, and electrophysiological levels. a distinct distribution of receptors or differing subunit expression across species could lead to variations in the brain\u2019s function at the molecular, cellular, and electrophysiological levels. the decline was most marked and persistent in the cerebellum. postmortem studies support this finding, showing neuronal loss. MRI also reveals significant volume deficits in the cerebellum of alcoholics. in alcoholics, certain regions of cerebellar volume shrinkage are better predictors of executive impairment than frontal lobe volumes. the relationship between the degree of cerebellar damage and cognitive functioning in alcoholics has not been unequivocally established. the distribution of dopamine receptors in the cerebellum also differs between the mouse, rat, guinea pig, cat, and monkey (Camps et al. 1990). the pattern of cerebellar pathology in response to alcohol in rodents is markedly different from that observed in humans (Tavares et al. 1987). a large body of research on alcohol addiction has focused on the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. dopamine neurons in the ventral striatum play a key role in this circuitry inextricably linked to the concept of reward. an increase in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is associated with the presence of a rewarding stimulus such as food. release may be three- to fivefold higher in response to alcohol, at least in acute stages. -opioid receptors in the VTA of wild-type Sprague-Dawley rats are activated. increase in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. -opioid receptor activation hyperpolarizes (i.e., suppresses or inactivates) GABAergic interneurons. strains may have different dopamine receptor binding properties and distributions. more \u201ceffective\u201d receptors may be associated with innate deficits in dopamine levels. the subregional topography of the dopamine transporter also has been shown to be inconsistent across species. striatum, cerebellum, amygdala and trace conditioning contribute to habit formation. a switch occurs in the control of instrumental behavior so that the associative or medial striatum, important in the early, goal-directed stage of action, is overridden by the sensorimotor or lateral striatum. ive evidence indicates that the basolateral amgydala is critical for experimental extinction of this acquired fear. several in vivo MRI studies provide evidence for volume deficits in the amygdala of chronic alcoholics. the hippocampus plays a critical role during trace eye-blink conditioning. chronic exposure to alcohol in rodents induces a decrease in neuronal counts in CA1 to CA4 regions of the hippocampus. compared with humans, rodents have a disproportionately larger hippocampal volume. modified hippocampal anatomy may contribute to impaired trace eye-blink conditioning in rats exposed to binge-like patterns of alcohol in the early postnatal period. cortiocotropin-releasing factor regulates the secretion of the pituitary hormone, adrenocorticotropin. adrenocorticotropin stimulates the adrenal gland to boost the synthesis of corticosteroid hormones. a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the CRF gene (2232 C>G) conferred a decreased sensitivity of the CRF promoter to corticosteroid regulation in vitro. monkeys with this polymorphism tended to be more exploratory and exhibited increased alcohol consumption compared with the monkeys in which this single nucleotide was unmodified. d-phe-CRF12\u201341 in the central nucleus of the amygdala reduced alcohol self-administration. blocking CRF receptors reduced alcohol consumption in dependent animals. the nervous pointer dog is a candidate for future research. no studies have used dogs to explore stress theory of alcohol abuse. early life stress in a species that exhibits low glucocorticoid receptor expression in infancy could be less harmful than early life stress in a species that exhibits high glucocorticoid receptor expression. early life stress in a species that exhibits low glucocorticoid receptor expression in infancy could be less harmful than early life stress in a species that exhibits high glucocorticoid receptor expression. inflammation Inflammatory responses to alcohol may contribute to alcohol-related brain damage. systemic cytokines (i.e., signalling proteins used extensively in cellular communication) may enter the brain to initiate inflammatory processes. postmortem studies of brains of human alcoholics support the finding that white matter is especially affected. volume reductions, demyelination, loss of myelinated fibers, and axonal deletions also have been observed. inflammation in the adult hippocampus may interfere with memory by inhibiting neurogenesis. a causal relationship between alcohol-induced neuroinflammation and alcohol-induced suppression of neurogenesis has yet to be established. there have been few studies designed to specifically test the hypothesis. the majority of shrinkage with drinking does not necessarily reflect \u201cneuronal loss\u201d. the majority of shrinkage with drinking does not necessarily reflect \u201cneuronal loss\u201d. this increase predicts improvement in neuropsychological test performance. a twofold increase in neurogenesis during abstinence from chronic alcohol exposure compared with alcohol-naive animals. this increase in neurogenesis may be related to recovery of brain volume deficits and cognitive deficits in abstinent alcoholics. studies in humans and animal models provide support for the involvement of specific brain structures over the course of alcohol addiction. a challenge will be to develop a theory that accounts for the brain structures uniquely targeted by alcohol. a theory that unifies the brain circuitries modified by alcohol may very well have a major impact on our understanding of brain function in general."}
