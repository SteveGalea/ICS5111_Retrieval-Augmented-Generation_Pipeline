{"summary": "RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) have a critical influence on post-transcriptional gene regulation [1,2,3], viral assembly [4,5,6], cellular defence [7], protein synthesis [8,9] and various other fundamental biological processes [10,11]. a significant portion of transcripts is long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which are not translated into proteins. support vector machines (SVMs) and Random Forests (RFs) based on more than 100 physical and functional features of RPIs. they evaluated the interaction propensities of protein-RNA based on their physicochemical properties. the RPISeq method still employed SVMs and RFs but exploited different features. derived kernel uses regularized least squares (RLS) to extract discriminant subsequence features from amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences. derived kernel measures the similarity between two biological sequences by capturing nucleic acid or amino acid compositions. different template sizes of protein and RNA chosen from set 1, 2,..., 4 1, 2,..., 8 for RPiRLS and 1, 2,..., 6 1, 2,..., 8 for RPiRLS-7G. table 3 showed that the method achieved the best prediction accuracy of 0.823 when the protein template size k = 3 and the RNA template size l = 4. the other measurements (AUC, SP and SE) were observed as 0.902, 0.761 and 0.884. l = 2 l = 3 l = 4 l = 5 l = 6 l = 7 l = 8 k = 1 0.673 0.763 0.812 0.817 0.779 0.769 0.769 0.756 0.756 0.743 k = 2 0.412 0.730 0.796 0.830 0.830 0.830 0.814 0.800 0.794 k = 3 0.261 0.646 0.731 0.784 0.811 0.8 different combinations of parameters k and l were evaluated. best accuracy in the table is marked in bold.

RPiRLS and RPiRLS-7G tested it on the NRPI13153 data set. table 6 showed the prediction results compared with the RPI-Pred classifier on the NRPI13153 data set. the predictive accuracy for different organisms was separately computed. ncRPIs RPiRLS RPiRLS-7G RPI-Pred Caenorhabditis elegans 36 0.92 0.61 0.92 Drosophila melanogaster 95 0.80 0.52 0.88 Escherichia coli 202 0.54 0.52 0.90 Homo sapiens 8246 0.92 0.74 0.86 Mus musculus 3669 0.91 0.80 0.94 Saccharomyces cerevisiae 905 0.91 0. caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, consisting of 4, 61, 78 and 437 lncRPIs. in Figure 2, RPI-Pred correctly predicted all 61 lncRPIs. RPiRLS missed 7 out of 61 lncRPIs for Drosophila melanogaster. 39 RPIs corresponded to 7 protein hubs, e.g., P0A6H1, P0AFZ3, P0AG67, P0CE47, P0CE48, P21499 and P77398, each appearing as a yellow rectangle node. the RPiRLS classifier correctly identified 410 out of 437 RPIs, achieving a high accuracy of 94%, compared of 87% (correctly predicted 379 out of 437 pairs) for R networks are visualized with Cytoscape v3.4.0. green (ellipse) and yellow (rectangle) nodes representing lncRNAs and proteins respectively, are connected by edges (solid lines) indicating an interaction between them. edges colored in blue and red indicate true positive and false negative interactions. the training set RPI2662 was used to extract discriminant subsequence features from amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences. we used different template sizes of protein and RNA chosen from set 1, 2,..., 4 1, 2,..., 8 for RPiRLS and 1, 2,..., 6 1, 2,..., 8 for RPiRLS-7G. the combined kernel K 2 dk was integrated with RLS to predict RNA-protein interactions. the model performs best with AUC score of 0.926 and accuracy of 0.830. the other measurements of specificity (SP) and sensitivity (SE) were 0.771 and 0.890. l stands for template size of amino acid sequences; l stands for template size of nucleic acid sequences. best accuracy in the table is marked in bold. performance of predicting RPIs was evaluated by using 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the RPI2662 data set. different combinations of parameters k and l were evaluated. RPiRLS and RPiRLS-7G classifiers were trained on the RPI2662 data set. the RPiRLS method outperformed RPI-Pred and IPMiner in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. the RPiRLS method correctly predicted 35980 out of 43010 RPIs, reaching the predictive accuracy of 84%. a large-scale ncRNA-protein interaction data set was retrieved from the NPInter data base. we trained RPiRLS and RPiRLS-7G on the RPI2662 data set. the prediction results were compared with the RPI-Pred classifier on the NRPI13153 data set. results indicated the effectiveness of our method to predict lncRNA-protein interactions only by using primary sequences of proteins and RNAs. the weighted average accuracy is given by the weighting on the number of RPIs of different organisms over the total. RPiRLS correctly identified all 4 lncRPIs (blue edges), while RPI-Pred correctly identified 3 out of 4. RPiRLS missed 7 out of 61 lncRPIs for Drosophila melanogaster. lncRNA-protein interactions are regulated by lncRNAs. RPiRLS had relative poor performance on Escherichia coli. the amino acid composition bias in Escherichia coli probably leaded to poor results. among 43 incorrect predicted pairs, 39 RPIs corresponded to 7 protein hubs. RPiRLS predicted 379 out of 437 pairs for RPI-pred. eukaryotic organisms comprised a variety of protein hubs and RNA hubs. networks are visualized with Cytoscape v3.4.0. high-throughput sequencing methods have accumulated huge amount of RNA-protein binding experimental data. most of the previous computational works on RPIs focus on the prediction of RNA-binding proteins or RNA-binding residues in a protein sequence [34,42,43,44]. to our knowledge, very limited works have been developed to predict the specific associations between RNAs and proteins. the RPiRLS method outperformed RPI-Pred and IPMiner in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. RPiRLS achieved an accuracy of 92% compared to 89% for RPI-Pred on the prediction of lncRNA-protein interactions. the reason for the good performance of the proposed method may be due to several factors. the proposed method relies solely on information derived from amino acid sequences and nucleic acid sequences. it does not consider higher structural information of protein and RNA. this may be seen as an advantage, since it can predict any RNA-protein pair. the training set, called RPI2662, was composed of 1331 RNA-protein interacting pairs and 1331 RNA-protein non-interacting pairs. the RPiRLS method was first evaluated using two popular non-redundant data sets of RPIs studied in [27]. the data set contains 12,114 experimentally validated lncRNA-protein pairs. for the RPiRLS classifier, each amino acid sequence comprised up to 20 different amino acids. for the RPiRLS-7G classifier, we adopted the same classification approach as [26,29] s is a string if s k = 1 A k, and s = ( s 1,..., s k) is a k-mer (e.g., a sequence of length k) if s A k for some k N with s i A. the process of computing the derived kernel mainly includes three steps as below. h H 1, h : ( 1,..., k ) ( i,..., i + k 1 ), for 1 i n k + 1. the second layer neural response of f defines a map as N 2 ( f ) : T 1 [ 0, 1 ]. the kernel function is symmetric (i.e., K ( f, g ) = K ( g, f ) and non-negative (i.e., K ( f, f \u2032 ) 0. we first apply the kernel to the set R which contains nucleic acid sequences. then apply the kernel to the set of amino acid sequences P, denote it by K 2 P. we can predict RPIs to any RNA-protein pairs with known primary sequences. if f 0, the predicted class is 1 for each i, otherwise it is 1. sensitivity ( SE) and specificity ( SP) are used to measure the ability of identifying positive and negative instances, respectively. TP, TN, FP and FN are the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, respectively. RNA-protein pairs are the same protein chains interacting with the same RNA chains. we removed those RNA-protein pairs with amino acid sequence length 25 or nucleic acid sequence length 15. this data set consisted of 43,010 experimentally validated RPIs from several sources. the data set consisted of 13,153 experimentally validated ncRNA-protein pairs from six model organisms. this data set contains 12,114 experimentally validated lncRNA-protein pairs. derived kernel was proposed by Smale et al. on images inspired by neuroscience of visual cortex. Suppose A is the set of 20 amino acids (for RPiRLS), 7 alphabets (for, RPiRLS-7G) or 4 nucleic acids. Suppose A is a finite set called the alphabet. the second layer neural response of f, denoted as N 2 ( f ) defines a map as N 2 ( f ), N 2 ( g ) L 2 ( T 1 ), (3) where L 2 ( T 1 ) denotes the L 2 inner product with respect to the uniform measure 1 T 1 t. N 2 ( f ) = 1 n k + 1 h H 1 K 1 ( f h, t ), t T 1, (2) where this process can continue if appropriate higher level templates are defined. at each layer (local) derived kernel, pooling is accomplished by taking an average over a set of transformations which calculating the frequency of a template that occurs in a sequence. in this paper, we deal with inner product kernels K which satisfies the Mercer Condition. K 2 dk ( ( r, r \u2032 ) and K 2 P ( p, p \u2032 ) are positive definite kernels. we can predict RPIs to any RNA-protein pairs with known primary sequences. y i 1, 1 for each i, if f 0, the predicted class is 1 (denotes non-interaction), otherwise it is 1 (denotes interaction). derived kernel was proposed by Smale et al. [49] on images inspired by neuroscience of visual cortex. the initial kernel is defined as K 1 ( x, y ) = 1, x = y 0, otherwise, (1) where x, y A k. x = y if and only if x i = y i for i = 1,..., k. Step 2. Let f = ( f 1,..., f n ), Denote by f the length of f, so here f = n. K 2 ( f, g ) = N 2 ( f ), N 2 ( g ) L 2 ( T 1 ), (3) where, L 2 ( T 1 ) denotes the inner product with respect to the uniform measure 1 T 1 t. T 1 is the cardinality of the template set T 1 and t is the Dirac measure; N 2 ( f ) = 1 n k + 1 h H 1 K 1 ( f h, t we first apply the kernel to the set R which contains nucleic acid sequences. then apply the kernel to the set of amino acid sequences P, denote it by K 2 P, and lastly combine two kernels in a natural way by tensor product for the set of RNA-protein pairs. the RLS can be written as follows: f z, = arg min f H K 1 # z ( x i, y i ) z f ( x i ) y i 2 + f K 2. (6) 4.3.3. Integrate RLS with the combined kernel K = K 2 dk. the accuracy is defined by Accuracy = TP + TN TP + TN + FP + FN. the AUC is further employed to measure the predictive performance."}
