{"summary": "the etiological agent, FMD virus (FMDV) possesses a positive-polarity, single-stranded RNA genome of 8.5 kb that encodes a single polyprotein. Upon cleavage by three virus-encoded proteinases, leader (Lpro), 2A, and 3Cpro (35), the polyprotein is processed into intermediate precursors. FMDV has developed the ability to counteract the host innate immune response. a number of cysteine proteases encoded by different RNA viruses have been found to antagonize the induction of type I IFNs (8, 10, 14, 30, 32, 33, 38, 40, 44, 45, 47, 56, 61) a number of cysteine proteases encoded by different RNA viruses have been found to antagonize the induction of type I IFNs. the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (30, 44, 45, 47), and the 3Cpro cysteine proteases of several picornaviruses. it remains unclear whether the 3Cpro of FMDV antagonizes the innate immune signaling pathways. we found that infection of cells with FMDV led to 3Cpro-mediated proteolysis of NEMO. luciferase reporter plasmids IFN-1-Luc, IFN--Luc, 4 PRDIII/I-Luc, and 4 PRDII-Luc contained four copies of the IRF- or NF-B-binding motif of the porcine IFN- promoter. cDNA expression constructs encoding porcine IPS-1, MDA5, RIG-I, and a constitutively activated form of RIG-I (RIG-I-N PK-15 cells grown in 24-well plates were cotransfected with 0.1 g/well of a reporter plasmid, 0.05 g/well of pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) where indicated, cells were further transfected with poly(IC) (1 g/well) 24 h after the initial cotransfection; the cells were lysed 12 h later. PK-15 cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 1 g of empty vector or a plasmid encoding 3Cpro. twenty-fours later, the cells were mock transfected or transfected with 1 g of poly(IC) for 12 h. total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) an anti-HA antibody (MBL, Japan) was used for immunoblotting. expression of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type (WT) and mutant 3Cpro was detected. luciferase reporter plasmids IFN-1-Luc, IFN--Luc, 4 PRDIII/I-Luc, and 4 PRDII-Luc have been described previously (50, 52) cDNA expression constructs encoding porcine IPS-1, MDA5, RIG-I, and a constitutively activated form of RIG-I (RIG-I-N) have been described previously (50\u201352) PK-15 cells grown in 24-well plates were cotransfected with 0.1 g/well of a reporter plasmid, 0.05 g/well of pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) where indicated, cells were further transfected with poly(IC) (1 g/well) 24 h after the initial cotransfection. data represent relative firefly luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. 24well plates were transfected with 1 g of empty vector or a plasmid encoding 3Cpro. total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) one microgram of this total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Toyobo, Japan) monoclonal antibody (MAb) shows equal protein sample loading. RESULTS Identification of FMDV 3Cpro as a viral inhibitor of IFN-/induction. overexpression of Lpro (Lbpro or Labpro) strongly suppressed poly(IC)-stimulated IFN- promoter activity compared to cells transfected with the empty vector (HA) overexpression of 3Cpro or its intermediate precursors (3ABC, 3BC, and 3CD) substantially reduced IFN- expression. PK-15 cells were transfected with IFN--Luc, pRL-TK plasmid and the indicated vectors expressing the FMDV proteins (0.8 g), using Lipofectamine 2000. twenty-four hours after the initial transfection, the cells were transfected with poly(IC) PK-15 cells were transfected with 1 g of plasmid encoding 3Cpro (HA-3Cpro) or an empty vector 24 h later, the cells were transfected with 1 g of poly(IC) total RNA was extracted from the cells and analyzed for the abundance of 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS, ISG54, IP-10, RANTES, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 mRNAs. the results are representative of those from three independent experiments. protease activity governs the ability of FMDV 3Cpro to suppress dsRNA-induced IFN response. FMDV 3Cpro disrupts RIG-I/MDA5 signaling for activation of both IRFs and NF-B. overexpression of a constitutively activated RIG-I mutant or MDA5 significantly activated the promoters compared with that of the empty-plasmid control. the FMDV 3Cpro protein disrupts RIG-I/MDA5 signaling. PK-15 cells were cotransfected with IFN--Luc, pRL-TK plasmid, and 0.5 g of plasmid encoding 3Cpro. the cells were transfected with 1 g of poly(IC) 3Cpro disrupted activation of both IRFs and NF-B via RIG-I/MDA5. no commercial antibodies against porcine RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1, and NEMO were available. we found that 3Cpro formed a complex with NEMO in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. PK-15 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged NEMO expression plasmid (2 g) and 1 g of plasmid encoding 3Cpro. cells were prepared 48 h posttransfection and analyzed by Western blotting. flag-NEMO-conjugated protein was verified with mouse anti-FLAG antibody. mouse anti-GAPDH antibody was used to detect GAPDH, which served as a protein-loading control. NEMO is cleaved in FMDV-infected cells. we transfected PK-15 cells with a constitutively activated form of NEMO (NEMO-K277A) to assess whether 3Cpro disrupts NEMO-dependent type I IFN signaling. NEMO-K277A was substantially more potent in activating the IFN- promoter and synthetic IRF- and NF-B-dependent promoters. cell lysates were prepared 48 h posttransfection and analyzed by Western blotting. anti-GAPDH antibody was used to detect GAPDH. PK-15 cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were transfected with Flag-tagged NEMO expression plasmid (2 g) and 1 g of plasmids encoding 3Cpro or empty vector. pRL-TK plasmid, and flag-tagged NEMO-K277A expression plasmid (0.5 g) an empty vector (pCMV-HA) was used as a control. cell extracts were collected 36 h after transfection. all three 3Cpro mutants no longer inhibited signaling for activation of the IFN- promoter by ectopically expressed NEMO-K277A. this result was consistent with the inability of these 3Cpro mutants to cleave NEMO. carmis et al. showed that a mutation in the FMDV capsid precursor may affect 3Cpro-mediated proteolytic cleavage at a distant site. however, 3Cpro-mediated NEMO cleavage was not affected by the Q348R, E349R, E354R, E362R, Q365R, E390R, E391R, or Q401R mutation. pRL-TK plasmid encoding flag-fused NEMO-K277A (Full) cleavage fragments exhibit impaired type I IFN signaling. PK-15 cells were transfected with IFN--Luc and DNA constructs encoding full-length NEMO-K277A. 3Cpro-mediated proteolysis of NEMO results in disruption of innate immune signaling by reducing availability of full-length NEMO. luciferase reporter plasmid followed by either mock infection or infection with FMDV at 0.1 PFU/cell. luciferase activity barely detectable in FMDV-infected cells at any time points examined. overexpression of 3Cpro or its intermediate precursors (3ABC, 3BC, and 3CD) significantly reduced IFN- expression. this implies that certain properties of 3Cpro may contribute to the ability of FMDV to inhibit induction of type I IFN transcription. PK-15 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding 3Cpro. PK-15 cells were transfected with poly(IC) or mock transfected with poly(IC) poly(IC) robustly induced the expression of 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS (Fig. 2A), ISG54 (Fig. 2B), IP-10 (Fig. 2C), RANTES (Fig. 2E), IL-6 (Fig. 2F), and IL-1 (Fig. 2G) in cells transfected with control vector. 3Cpro effectively impairs intracellular dsRNA-induced IFN-stimulated genes and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines FMDV 3Cpro is a cysteine proteinase responsible for most cleavages within the viral polyprotein. Mutations at any of these residues eliminated the capacity of FMDV 3Cpro to catalytically cleave P1, P2, or P3 substrates in trans. FMDV 3Cpro disrupts RIG-I/MDA5 signaling for activation of both IRFs and NF-B. overexpression of a constitutively activated RIG-I mutant or MDA5 significantly activated the promoters compared with that of the empty-plasmid control. PK-15 cells were cotransfected with IFN--Luc, pRL-TK plasmid, and 0.5 g of plasmid encoding 3Cpro. the cells were transfected with 1 g of poly(IC) NEMO and its upstream signaling molecules serve as substrates for 3Cpro. no commercial antibodies against porcine RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1, and NEMO were available. the protein abundance of full-length Flag-NEMO was reduced in PK-15 cells coexpressing 3Cpro. PK-15 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged NEMO expression plasmid (2 g) and 1 g of plasmid encoding 3Cpro. cell lysates were prepared 48 h posttransfection and analyzed by Western blotting. NEMO is cleaved in FMDV-infected cells. to exclude the possibility that the observed cleavage was an artificial effect of plasmid overexpression in cell culture. we transfected IBRS-2 cells with the Flag-NEMO-encoding vector for 24 h. NEMO-K277A was significantly more potent in activating the IFN- promoter and synthetic IRF- and NF-B-dependent promoters. NEMO-K277A substitution did not alter the susceptibility of NEMO to 3Cpro cleavage. PK-15 cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were transfected with flag-tagged NEMO expression plasmid (2 g) and 1 g of plasmids encoding 3Cpro or empty vector. anti-GAPDH antibody was used to detect beta actin, which served as a protein-loading control. pCMV-HA was used as a control. cells were collected 36 h after transfection and analyzed for firefly and Renilla luciferase expression. error bars indicate standard deviations. FN- promoter by ectopically expressed NEMO-K277A. this result was consistent with the inability of these 3Cpro mutants to cleave NEMO. previous studies on 3Cpro substrate specificity documented a preference for glutamine (Gln, Q) or glutamic acid (Glu, E) at the P1 position (6). 3Cpro-mediated NEMO cleavage was not affected by the Q348R, E349R, E354R, E362R, Q365R, E390R, E391R, or Q401R mutation. NEMO-K277A bearing the Q383R mutation also became resistant to 3Cpro cleavage. the domains of porcine NEMO were annotated analogously to those of human NEMO. 3Cpro-induced NEMO cleavage fragments exhibit impaired type I IFN signaling. previous studies have indicated that the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger domain of NEMO is required for full NEMO activation. DISCUSSION FMD is one of the most contagious diseases of cloven-hoofed animals. to survive in the host, FMDV has evolved strategies to block IFN expression. previous studies have revealed that FMDV Lpro antagonizes the innate immune responses by inhibiting type I interferon production. poliovirus, rhinovirus type 1a, and encephalomyocarditis virus induce MDA5 degradation. cleavage of a signaling adaptor proximal to the IKK complex has not been reported. NEMO was cleaved by 3Cpro in FMDV-infected porcine cells. the lpaH9.8 protein of Shigella bacteria acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to promote polyubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of NEMO. the porcine NEMO protein exhibits a high degree (89%) of sequence conservation. ectopically expressed Flag\u2013RIG-I, Flag-MDA5 and Flag\u2013IPS-1 proteins were reduced in cells coexpressing 3Cpro. however, no cleavage products were observed, suggesting these proteins are unlikely to be proteolytic substrates for FMDV 3Cpro. however, it is impossible to dissect activity of 3Cpro toward NEMO cleavage from that toward inhibiting host protein translation. 3Cpro may dampen host innate immunity by cleaving the translation initiation factor eIF-4A (5) and thereby shutting off host protein synthesis. it will be interesting to investigate whether NEMO cleavage is a shared attribute among 3C proteinases of different picornaviruses."}
