{"summary": "45% of household contacts of symptomatic patients never developed disease symptoms despite becoming infected with the virus and mounting EBOV-specific immune responses. authors hypothesize that human-animal contact with noninfectious virus particles in the environment may have triggered virus-specific immune responses. asymptomatic infections that induce protective immunity reduced Ebola incidence projections for liberia by 50%. asymptomatic cases that arise from environmental exposure could have similar dampening effects on epidemic spread. the frequency of such environmental exposure would depend on the animal community in a region. phylogenetic analysis of EBOV in great apes suggests genetic variation can accumulate rapidly during EBOV transmission in these populations. the idea that virus circulation in wild species can drive changes that impact human\u2013virus interactions has support for other RNA viruses such as SARS coronavirus and influenza A virus. molecular changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein from highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5) can facilitate efficient mammal-to-mammal transmission. disproportionately high contact rates (super spreaders) were responsible for a majority of virus transmission events in humans. deer mice are the hosts most likely to pass the Lyme bacterium to feeding ticks. the diversity of hosts available on which ticks can feed determines the abundance of ticks and the infection rates of these ticks. a first step toward greater integration involves student training. training grants focused on multiscale literacy in infectious disease research should be a priority for funding agencies. professional societies could lead the way by sponsoring workshops, symposia, and other events on integration across disciplines."}
