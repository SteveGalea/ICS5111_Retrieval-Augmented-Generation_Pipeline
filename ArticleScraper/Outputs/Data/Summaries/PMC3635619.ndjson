{"summary": "the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1 09) spread in 214 countries with more than 18306 deaths. it is known for continuous antigenic change through antigenic drift and shift. the virus is known for continuous antigenic change through antigenic drift and shift. nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and NP aspirates are the best choice of samples. nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and NP aspirates are the best choice of samples. sample for influenza detection, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and NP aspirates are the best choice of samples. samples with high viral titres do not limit quantitation after several freezing and thawing cycles. hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA), enzyme immunoassay (EIA), complement fixation, and neutralization tests. one study reports that the antibody titer reaches peak within 14 days of illness. more than 80.0% of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive influenza virus to seroconvert. s a cell mixture containing Mink Lung epithelial cells and A549 cells can give result after 24-48 h of inoculation. the kit named D3 Ultra 2009 H1N1 Influenza A ID kit (2009 H1N1 ID kit; Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc., Athens, OH, USA) is developed which utilizes the R-mix Too cells. rapid tests are known to have 50.0-70.0% sensitivity in comparison to viral culture method HIA is found to be useful to prohibit vaccinations when there is likelihood of severe reactions during the next outbreak of H1N1.17,18. but this method is not regarded as effective diagnostic tool because it requires two serum samples with accurate timing and also has longer throughput. the test result is not interpretable with possibilities of misguidance in clinical decision making. the kit named D3 Ultra 2009 H1N1 Influenza A ID kit (2009 H1N1 ID kit; Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc., Athens, OH, USA) uses immunofluorescence method for the specific diagnosis of H1N1 09.27. rapid tests are known to have 50.0-70.0% sensitivity in comparison to viral culture method or PCR-based methods. the commercially available rapid antigen tests are mostly immunoassays that target the antigen of influenza virus. however, they have relatively poor sensitivity in comparison to virus culture technique and PCR-based assays. a recent study has revealed 90.0% sensitive Actim Influenza A&B kit (Medix Biochemica, Joensuu, Finland) for the detection of influenza A virus among 1-3 years old children. this indicates that pediatric group have generally higher viral load fair enough for the kits to detect the virus in comparison to adults or other patients. the performance of the test was better with children below 10 years of age. the sensitivity of DFA was 93.0% with adult in a study by Pollock, et al.,41 in 2009 for H1N1 09. In another study, the sensitivity of DFA was 93.0% with adult in a study by pollock, et al. PCR-based assay in detecting influenza virus was described in 1991 by Zhang and Evans. RT-PCR followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is able to detect culture-unidentified viruses. CDC recommended using one step RT-PCR technique targeting the matrix gene of H1N1 09.51. nucleic acid sequence-based amplification tests are known to be more sensitive than the RT-PCR tests for the detection of influenza virus. it can detect the H1N1 09 in 90 min with sensitivity and specificity of 100.0%. multiplex nucleic acid-based amplification test along with an enzyme-linked oligonucleotide capture has shown to rapidly and specifically detect a single virus. the techniques available to monitor the drug resistance include neuraminidase inhibition assay, pyrosequencing, use of genotype specific primers, or real time RT-PCR. real-time quantitative RT-PCR provides a rapid, highly sensitive, and specific alternative to sequencing. however, it is specific for seasonal influenza A or needs multiple primers to detect H1N1 09 viruses resistant to oseltamivir. the fast and specific RIDTs, also called point of care tests, are not appropriate for the diagnosis because of their poor performance. however, they are simple, cheap, easily interpretable and handy. they are also not appropriate for the diagnosis because of their poor performance."}
