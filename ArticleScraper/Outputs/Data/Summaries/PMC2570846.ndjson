{"summary": "720 samples were tested from 680 patients at the Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany. all had symptoms compatible with acute or recent CHIKV infection (sudden onset of fever, muscle and joint pain, headaches, rash) upon return to Europe. indirect Immunofluorescence CHIKV strain S27 was grown on vero cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5. cells were spread on slides after 24 h, air dried, and fixed in ice-cold acetone. antibodies were detected by anti-human IgG or IgM labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sifin, Berlin, Germany). RT-PCR target region in plasmid pCR2.1 (invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) inserts together with a 5\u2032-T7 promotor sequence were amplified with M13 plasmid-specific primers. transcripts were quantified by photometer and used as quantification standards. mutagenic primers were cloned into pCR2.1 and transcribed into RNA. mutated constructs were cloned into pCR2.1 and transcribed into RNA. RNA copies/mL of serum were detected at >95% certainty. quantitative correlation between both assays was close (regression analysis slope = 1, SD 0.04, p0.001; online Appendix, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/14/3/416-appG2.htm). a fragment of the CHIKV E1 gene was amplified directly from patient plasma and sequenced. all samples that were taken during the first 12 days of illness were also tested for dengue virus by real-time RT-PCR (28). the average ages of travelers to each country did not differ significantly. for 121 patients, exact dates of onset and sampling could be retrieved through voluntary questionnaires completed by telephone or fax. all samples with possible CHIKV in 2006 were tested for IgG and IgM by indirect immunofluorescence. indirect Immunofluorescence CHIKV strain S27 was grown on vero cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5. cells were spread on slides after 24 h, air dried, and fixed in ice-cold acetone. antibodies were detected by anti-human IgG or IgM labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sifin, Berlin, Germany) Specificity of antibodies was confirmed by plaque-reduction neutralization assay on TGATCCCGACTCAACCATCCTGGAT 241-261 (AF369024) ChikSII Forward primer, adapted assay for Indian Ocean strain CCGACTCAACCATCCTGGAT 246-265 (DQ443544) ChikAsII Reverse primer, general CHIKV assay GGCAAACGCAGTGGTACTTCCT 323-302 (AF369024) ChikP Detection probe, internal control DYXL-A CHIKV assay detected 3,844 RNA copies/mL of serum at >95% certainty (95% confidence interval [CI] 2,834\u20136,832 copies/mL) the assay adapted to the current Indian Ocean strain detected 2,285 copies/mL at 95% certainty (95% CI 1,694\u20135,326 copies/mL) for dengue antibodies by an IgM -capture assay (Pan-Bio, Sinnamon Park, Queensland, Australia) and by indirect IgG immunofluorescence assay as described (27). all samples that were taken during the first 12 days of illness were also tested for dengue virus by real-time RT-PCR. in the first half of the year, the rate of confirmed infection for patients with suspected CHIKV was 24.4%; in the second half, 9.9%. CHIKV IgG was found for 79% of patients (125 [81.7%] of 153 samples) earliest sample with a detectable IgG titer had been drawn on day 2 after onset. paired samples were drawn at least 14 days apart. the first samples were collected after a median of 13 days from onset (range 5\u201368 days), and all had IgM (median titer 320) and IgG (median titer 2,560) the second samples were collected after a median of 77 days from onset (range 20\u2013207 days) antibody detection + indicates an IgG or IgM titer >10 by immunofluorescence assay. we compared RNA concentrations in seronegative (n = 21) and seropositive (n = 6) samples. highest concentrations were found in samples drawn on day 0 with a mean of 1.2 109 RNA copies/mL. dengue virus is endemic to parts of the Indian Ocean region and resembles CHIKV infection. only 3 of 368 patients had dengue IgG. dengue IgM antibodies without IgG were found for 2 additional patients. cross-sectional laboratory results CHIKV infection was laboratory-confirmed for 152 (22%) symptomatic patients and 188 (26%) samples. median IgG titer for all 156 IgG-positive samples was 2,560 (range 40\u201340,960) in the first half of the year, the rate of confirmed infection for patients with suspected CHIKV was 24.4%; in the second half, 9.9%. CHIKV IgG was found for 79% of patients (125 [81.7%] of 153 samples) for 11 patients whose first sample yielded antibodies, consecutive samples were available. the first samples were collected after a median of 13 days from onset (range 5\u201368 days) the second samples were collected after a median of 77 days from onset (range 20\u2013207 days) virus isolation + indicates isolation success as confirmed by reverse transcription\u2013PCR. RNA concentrations were 9.85 107 copies/mL in seronegative samples. highest concentrations were found in samples drawn on day 0 with a mean of 1.2 109 RNA copies/mL. dengue Virus Co-infections Dengue virus is endemic to parts of the Indian Ocean region and resembles CHIKV infection. only 3 of 368 patients had dengue IgG. dengue IgM antibodies without IgG were found for 2 additional patients. chikungunya fever has become a major differential diagnosis, along with malaria and dengue fever, for ill travelers returning from the Indian Ocean region. chikungunya fever has similar symptoms but requires different management than malaria and dengue fever. laboratory testing for CHIKV is now part of routine clinical decision making. IgG and IgM antibodies were detected soon after onset of symptoms. they were present in all patients in whom acute infection was confirmed after 5 days. most likely this finding was caused not by low sensitivity of our IgM assay but by an unusually early IgG response. the most important difference was an early IgG response to CHIKV, compared with a clear delay of IgG in most acute cases of primary dengue virus infection (27,31). for a substantial fraction of patients, dengue IgG is not detected until after 2 weeks of illness (27,31). the reason for this difference is the different tropism of each virus. a high viremia in presymptomatic patients seems likely. the issue of transfusion transmissibility of CHIKV is unclear. a previous study found an exchange in the E1 envelope glycoprotein increased over time in isolates from R\u00e9union Island."}
