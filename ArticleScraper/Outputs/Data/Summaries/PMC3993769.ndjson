{"summary": "coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand RNA viruses that infect numerous mammalian and avian hosts (1, 2). a previously unknown pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) initiated an epidemic that spread worldwide before the human chain of transmission was broken. the coronavirus N protein has two distinct RNA-binding domains, a characteristic that is unusual and possibly unique among RNA virus capsid proteins. despite this uncertainty about function, much has been learned about N protein structure in recent years. a model of the MHV N protein showing domains as defined previously (16, 17) the RNA-binding domains are N1b (or NTD) and N2b (or CTD) other segments of the molecule include the amino terminus N1a, the central spacer N2a and the M protein-binding domain N3. domain N2a contains a serine- and arginine-rich region that interacts with the replicase subunit nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) to mediate a crucial early step in infection (17, 18, 34) a similar strategy led to the replacement of the entire MHV N protein with that of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) the host range chimeric coronaviruses designated fMHV and fMHV.v2 (35, 36), which were used for reverse genetics, were grown in Felis catus whole-fetus whole-fetus (FCWF) cells. pSG6X is identical to the previously described pMH54 (35), except for a coding-silent PspXI site (underlined) changing N gene codons 14 through 16 fragment synthesized by two-step PCR using a cloned SARS-CoV gene cDNA. an additional PspXI site was removed from the SARS-CoV N sequence. the S1b-S2b double substitution was made by shuttling the NheI-BspEI fragment of the S2b plasmid into the S1b plasmid. an isogenic wild-type recombinant, Alb741, was isolated by targeted RNA recombination with donor RNA from pSG6X. the enhancement of the infectivity of MHV genomic RNA (gRNA) by wild-type or mutant N mRNA was measured by plaque assays. Western blotting of purified virions was performed exactly as described previously (16, 37) proteins were detected with anti-MHV-N monoclonal antibody J.3.3, anti-MHV-M monoclonal antibody J.1.3, or anti-SARS-CoV N rabbit polyclonal antibody. RNA was extracted from purified virions or from infected cell monolayers. random-primed cDNA made from total RNA purified from infected 17Cl1 cells was amplified by PCR using primer L (corresponding to nucleotides 344 to 364 of gene 2a), primer B (complementary to nucleotides 247 to 264 of gene 5a), or primer C (complementary to nucleotides 626 to 645 of the N gene) each N gene mutation was first constructed in the plasmid pCK70XB (18) the unique PspXI-NheI segment of pCK70XB took advantage of the unique PspXI-BspEI site upstream of domains N1b and N2b. an additional PspXI site was removed from the SARS-CoV N sequence. mutagenesis of the S1b-S2b plasmid was produced by PCR-based mutagenesis of the S1b-S2b plasmid. all of the partial S2b substitutions\u2014S2bN, S2bC, S2b1, and S2b3\u2014were generated by replacement of the NgoMIV-BstXI segment of pCK70XB. medium containing released virus was harvested at 12 to 16 h postinfection. monolayers exhibited maximum syncytium formation but only minimal lysis or detachment. virions were then immunopurified with anti-M monoclonal antibody. RNA was extracted from purified virions or from infected cell monolayers. blotting of purified virion or intracellular RNA was carried out as detailed previously. RNA was probed with a PCR product corresponding to the 3\u2032-most 539 nucleotides of the N gene. RESULTS Construction of MHV N protein mutants containing SARS-CoV RNA-binding domains. in the S1b mutant, the MHV domain N1b (or NTD) was replaced by the SARS-CoV domain N1b (or CTD) with which it shares 44% amino acid identity. the two mutants, as well as an otherwise isogenic wild-type virus, were constructed by targeted RNA recombination. the chimeric N proteins domain N3 and the SR region, which interacts with nsp3 (17, 18, 34), were both derived from the MHV N protein. however, no compensatory mutations in the Ubl1 domain of nsp3 or in the M protein had been required to allow either of the RNA-binding domain substitutions. titrations were carried out on L2 cells at 39\u00b0C. in this manner, we obtained 18 independent revertants, 11 from the S1b mutant and 7 from the S2b mutant. the full N gene sequences of these viruses revealed a total of 11 unique reverting mutations. two of the reverting mutations, D248Y and D248H, were identical to S1b reverting mutations. most of the reverting mutations brought about a net increase of positive charge, either by changing a negatively charged residue to a neutral or polar residue. this may indicate that an important effect of most of the reverting mutations is to increase the general affinity of N protein for RNA. two independent isolates of the resulting S1bR1 mutant showed markedly larger plaques than the original S1b mutant at both 37 and 39\u00b0C. this established that the D308Y mutation alone is indeed capable of significantly enhancing the growth of the S1b mutant. we also tried to learn the significance of the cluster of S1b and S2b reverting mutations at the downstream edge of domain N2a. asterisks denote lethal substitutions. in the S1bR4 mutant, both the S1b and S2b substitutions were added to a partial substitution of domain N2a. eighteen independent revertants of Alb25 were isolated from passage 2 stocks on the basis of their ability to form plaques larger than those of the original mutant. three revertants (rev2, rev5, and rev12) exactly returned phenylalanine back to cysteine at the site of the primary mutation. these viruses formed wild-type-sized plaques at the nonpermissive temperature. reverting mutations of the Alb25, S1b, and S2b mutants point to a broad set of intramolecular interactions between the two RNA-binding domains of the coronavirus N protein. each sgRNA contains a 5\u2032 leader (72 nucleot) each sgRNA contains a 5\u2032 leader (72 nucleot). the leader-body fusion occurs at a short transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) common to the 3\u2032 end of the leader RNA and the 5\u2032 end of each body RNA. this discontinuous transcription is brought about by a highly efficient strand-switching event that takes place during negative-strand RNA synthesis. at the top is the genome (gRNA), comprising the replicase genes (rep 1a and 1b) and downstream genes for the structural proteins spike (S), envelope ( PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis; std, DNA size standards. star and circles indicate aberrant PCR products due to mispriming by downstream primers A and B. random-primed cDNA was amplified with a positive-sense leader primer (primer L) paired with various negative-sense primers to cross the leader-body junctions of sgRNA2 (primer A), sgRNA4 and -5 (primer B), or sgRNA7 (primer C). only two unexpected products were observed, a 300-bp band unique to the S1b mutant, which was generated with primers L and A. RT-PCR was carried out pairing primer L with negative-sense primers located either 266 or 584 nucleotides downstream of this potential TRS. however, neither the mutant yielded a product of the expected size with either set of primer pairs. transfected cells were seeded into dishes and overlaid with agar. plaques were counted after 48 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. each histogram represents the mean infectious titer (standard deviation) from four transfections. total RNA extracted from cells infected with the S1b mutant, the S2b mutant, or the wild type consisted of gRNA almost entirely devoid of sgRNA. this result was in accordance with previous work showing a high level of gRNA packaging selectivity by MHV. virions of the S1b mutant maintained a degree of packaging stringency equivalent to that of the wild type. MHV RNA was detected with a probe specific for the 3\u2032 end of the genome. the absence of the PS had only a minimal effect on viral growth. this raised the question of whether revertants of the S2b mutant somehow regained packaging competence. partial S2b substitution mutants were detected with a probe specific for the 3\u2032 end of the genome. one pair of constructs, S2bN and S2bC, divided the original S2b substitution into two parts. a further group of constructs, S2b1, S2b2, and S2b3, made smaller substitutions of three regions of SARS-CoV N2b that are colinear with their aligned MHV counterparts. asterisks denote lethal substitutions compared with wild-type plaques at 37 or 39\u00b0C. monolayers were stained with neutral red at 72 h postinfection. brackets beneath alignment indicate extent of SARS-CoV N sequence substitution. reverting mutations compensated for folding defects created by the juxtaposition of MHV and SARS-CoV amino acid residues within the domain N2b structure. one revertant, S2b2-rev2, formed the largest plaques at 39\u00b0C, was selected as representative of the set. chimeric viruses were seen to be identical to the previously characterized silPS mutant. MHV N protein mutants containing SARS-CoV RNA-binding domains were constructed by targeted RNA recombination. in the S1b mutant, the MHV domain N1b (or NTD) was replaced by the even divergent SARS-CoV domain N2b, with which it shares 44% amino acid identity. the mutants, as well as an otherwise isogenic wild-type virus, were constructed by targeted RNA recombination. mutants formed plaques that were smaller than those of the wild type at 33, 37, and 39\u00b0C. both mutants formed plaques that were smaller than those of the wild type at 33, 37, and 39\u00b0C. plaque titrations were carried out on L2 cells at 39\u00b0C. the plaques chosen ranged from slightly to substantially larger than those of the original mutant. the full N gene sequences of these viruses revealed a total of 11 unique reverting mutations. two of the S2b reverting mutations, D248Y and D248H, were identical to the first set of S1b revertants. most of the reverting mutations brought about a net increase of positive charge. this may indicate that an important effect of most of the reverting mutations is to increase the general affinity of N protein for RNA. two independent isolates of the resulting S1bR1 mutant showed markedly larger plaques than the original S1b mutant at 37 and 39\u00b0C. this established that the D308Y mutation alone is indeed capable of significantly enhancing the growth of the S1b mutant. we also tried to learn the significance of the cluster of S1b and S2b reverting mutations at the downstream edge of domain N2a. in the S1bR1 mutant, the S1b substitution was paired with the reverting mutation D308Y in domain N2a. in the S1b[2a]2b mutant, both the S1b and S2b substitutions were added to a partial substitution of domain N2a. in the S1b[2a]2b mutant, both the S1b and S2b substitutions were added to a partial substitution of domain N2a. eighteen independent revertants of Alb25 were isolated from passage 2 stocks on the basis of their ability to form plaques larger than those of the original mutant. three revertants (rev2, rev5, and rev12) exactly returned phenylalanine back to cysteine at the site of the primary mutation. these viruses formed wild-type-sized plaques at the nonpermissive temperature. reverting mutations of the revertants point to a broad set of intramolecular interactions between the two RNA-binding domains of the coronavirus N protein. a distinguishing characteristic of coronavirus infections is the transcription of a 3\u2032 nested set of subgenomic RNAs that serve as the mRNAs for expression of all genes downstream of the replica. each sgRNA contains a 5\u2032 leader (72 nucleotides [nt] for MHV) the leader-body fusion occurs at a short transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) common to the 3\u2032 end of the leader RNA and the 5\u2032 end of each body RNA. this discontinuous transcription is brought about by a highly efficient strand-switching event that takes place during negative-strand RNA synthesis. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis; std, DNA size standards. star and circles indicate aberrant PCR products due to mispriming by downstream primers A and B. the sequence traces, obtained with downstream primers A and B, are negative sense. random-primed cDNA was amplified with a positive-sense leader primer (primer L) paired with various negative-sense primers to cross the leader-body junctions of sgRNA2 (primer A), sgRNA4 and -5 (primer B), or sgRNA7 (primer C) the different primer pairs produced the same set of PCR products of the predicted sizes for RNA from cells infected with either the S1b mutant, the S2 nt 13588 to 13593 in the MHV nsp12 coding region. RT-PCR was carried out pairing primer L with negative-sense primers located either 266 or 584 nucleotides downstream of this potential TRS. neither the wild-type mutant yielded a product of the expected size with either set of primer pairs. transfected cells were seeded into dishes and overlaid with agar. plaques were counted after 48 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. each histogram represents the mean infectious titer (standard deviation) from four transfections. end of the MHV genome detected the identical 3\u2032 nested set of viral RNA species in total RNA extracted from cells infected with the S1b mutant, the S2b mutant, or the wild type. this result was in accord with previous work showing a high level of gRNA packaging selectivity by MHV. virions of the S1b mutant maintained a degree of packaging stringency equivalent to that of the wild type. MHV RNA was detected with a probe specific for the 3\u2032 end of the genome. in prior work, we showed that the absence of the PS had only a minimal effect on viral growth, but its presence provided a selective advantage (37). revertants of the S2b mutant, which had been selected by serial passaging, somehow regained packaging competence. MHV RNA was detected with a probe specific for the 3\u2032 end of the genome. one pair of constructs, S2bN and S2bC, divided the original S2b substitution into two parts. a further group of constructs, S2b1, S2b2, and S2b3, made smaller substitutions of three regions of SARS-CoV N2b that are colinear with their aligned MHV counterparts. asterisks denote lethal substitutions compared with wild-type plaques at 37 or 39\u00b0C. asterisks denote lethal substitutions; asterisks denote lethal substitutions. mutations in the S2b2 revertants all fell within domain N2b. reverting mutations compensated for folding defects created by juxtaposition of MHV and SARS-CoV amino acid residues within the domain N2b structure. interval of MHV domain N2b, residues 298 through 327, is sufficient to disrupt packaging selectivity. however, we cannot rule out the participation of other N2b residues in PS recognition. the role of the MHV PS in its native locus in the viral genome was only recently examined. the silPS and PS mutants were shown to be less fit than wild-type virus in tissue culture. disruption of PS sequence and structure, nevertheless, was found to cause the indiscriminate packaging of sgRNAs along with gRNA into assembled virions. in the viral genome, in contrast to defective interfering RNAs, the PS is not absolutely required for gRNA packaging. a priori evidence has been presented for the specific binding of MHV N protein to PS RNA in vitro (14), and it would seem, a priori, to be the viral protein that acts in selective recognition of gRNA. however, it has been shown that not only gRNA but also all sgRNAs are coimmunoprecipitated from infected cell extracts. binding was envisioned to mediate the template-switching events that form sgRNA leader-body junctions during negative-strand RNA synthesis (10) binding was envisioned to mediate the template-switching events that form sgRNA leader-body junctions during negative-strand RNA synthesis. but for four different sgRNAs, we detected only leader-body junctions identical to those of the wild type. cryo-electron microscopic (69) and cryo-electron tomographic (70) images of MHV and SARS-CoV virions have shown thread-like connections between the M endodomain and the nucleocapsid. if there existed other critical N-M interactions, we would have expected them to have been perturbed in the S1b or S2b mutants. however, sequence analysis of the S1b and S2b mutants indicated s were coincident with particular S1b reverting mutations in domain N2a. s were coincident with some S2b reverting mutations in domain N2a. this web of connections calls to mind multiple interdomain interactions that have been shown to affect the function of MHV nsp5. the most commonly arising S2b reverting mutation (D248Y) did not restore packaging competence to the S2b mutant. this interpretation does not explain why the nonspecific RNA-binding properties of SARS-CoV domains N1b and N2b should be different from those of the corresponding MHV N domains. the silPS and PS mutants were shown to be less fit than wild-type virus in tissue culture. however, disruption of PS sequence and structure was found to cause the indiscriminate packaging of sgRNAs along with gRNA into assembled virions. in the viral genome, in contrast to defective interfering RNAs, the PS is not absolutely required for gRNA packaging. sgRNAs are coimmunoprecipitated from infected cell extracts by anti-N antibodies (15, 63, 64) and all sgRNAs are coimmunoprecipitated from infected cell extracts by anti-N antibodies. in a virus-like particle system it was found that M protein determined the selective packaging of nonviral RNA containing the MHV PS (65). a population of aberrant transcripts was found in four different sgRNAs. if this were the case, then we would find a population of aberrant transcripts. however, for four different sgRNAs, we detected only leader-body junctions identical to those of the wild type. MHV and SARS-CoV virions have shown thread-like connections between the M endodomain and the nucleocapsid. if there existed other critical N-M interactions, we would have expected them to have been perturbed in the S1b or S2b mutants. however, sequence analysis of the S1b and S2b mutants indicated no compensatory mutations in M were required for the viability of these chimeras. 1b reverting mutations were coincident with some S2b reverting mutations in domain N2a. this web of connections calls to mind the multiple interdomain interactions that have been shown to affect the function of MHV nsp5, the main protease of the replicase-transcriptase complex. reverting mutation (D248Y) did not restore packaging competence to the mutant. this interpretation does not explain why the nonspecific RNA-binding properties of SARS-CoV domains N1b and N2b should be different from those of the corresponding MHV N domains."}
