      "  #   [0] the viral shedding pattern of sars-cov is different from that of other respiratory viruses, with respiratory shedding peaking during the second week and lasting for more than 6 weeks in some cases. stool shedding also occurs later than expected, with the ability to detect virus in stool specimens peaking at the beginning of the second week and remaining high over weeks 3-4. the diagnostic yield of different specimen types varies for sars-cov, with throat washing samples being the most inferior respiratory specimens. pooled throat and nasal swab specimens provide a higher diagnostic yield compared with nasopharyngeal aspirates. a combination of stool sample and pooled throat and nasal swab specimens should be the specimens of choice for a safe and high-yield sars-cov detection. sars-cov can survive for at least 2-4 days at room temperature when mixed with diarrheal or normal stool specimens, and the poor isolation rate from stool may be due to the presence of toxic substances in stool or rectal swab samples or the possibility of viral growth interference due to the presence of immunoglobulin  ig a antibodies. positive virologic results are associated with more adverse outcomes in sars-cov patients, potentially confounded by the fact that only high-yield specimens, such as tracheal aspirate, can be obtained from intubated patients. the ability to accurately diagnose sars-cov infection needs improvement, with options including the inclusion of levels of viremia in the diagnostic algorithm, the development of a sars-cov-specific monoclonal antibody for detecting virus-infected cells from respiratory samples, and the development of an assay to detect viral antigens from stool samples as is available for rotavirus detection. the unusual shedding pattern of sars-cov should also be considered when formulating infection control strategies.\n",
      "  [1] in a mouse model, a single high dose of mdef201 administered 8 weeks prior to infection with vaccinia virus provides a high degree of protection from death, with similar effects seen with lower doses administered 1 day before infection  extended prophylaxis . against vaccinia virus lri, mdef201 delivered to the nasal sinus requires a 10-fold higher dose than that delivered to the lungs in order to protect equally against body weight loss during the infection. in the case of cowpox virus infection, lower doses of mdef201 are less effective, requiring higher doses for efficacy against this virus strain. the extended prophylactic effect of mdef201 against vaccinia virus infections in mice is remarkably long, lasting at least 8 weeks after administration. the adenovirus vector used to deliver mdef201 is still present in the snouts of mdef201-treated mice 60 days after exposure, suggesting that the extended prophylactic effect may exist in the absence of measurable serum interferon levels.\n",
      "  [2] a review by hemila et al.  2013  found that therapeutic doses of vitamin c  0.2g/day or more  can shorten the duration of the common cold, but with no statistical significance due to heterogeneity related to sex and dosage. however, studies by elwood pc and tyrrell da indicated that mere therapeutic doses of vitamin c are effective in men rather than women, reducing the main duration, nasal congestion or running nose, and limb and muscle pain. vitamin c is the most effective water-soluble antioxidant in human plasma, concentrated in leukocytes, and its concentration rapidly declines during infections and stress. vitamin c supplementation improves the ability to resist infection by improving the activities of the immune system, such as antimicrobial and natural killer cell activities, lymphocyte proliferation, chemotaxis, and delayed-type hypersensitivity. it also contributes to hormone regulation, including activation of the sympathetic nervous system and secretion of epinephrine during abnormal stress. the combination of supplemental and therapeutic doses of vitamin c is capable of relieving chest pain, fever, and chills, as well as shortening the time of confinement indoors and mean duration. data availability  all data are contained within the paper. a large dose of vitamin c during the common cold, usually 3.0g/day to 4.0g/day, can better recover health, while administration of extra doses of vitamin c at the onset of a common cold can help reduce the duration by about half a day, shorten the time confined indoors by about 10 hours, and relieve symptoms of a common cold, including chest pain, fever, and chills. language limitations weakened the exactness and representativeness of the study's data, as in some cases, the data had to be calculated and transformed rather than being available directly. therapeutic rcts must be conducted according to stricter, more precise guidelines to gain more knowledge on this subject. conflicts of interest  the authors declare no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.\n",

      "  [1] an ideal sars-cov vaccine should elicit highly potent neutralizing antibody responses against a broad spectrum of viral strains, induce protection against infection and transmission, and be safe by not inducing any infection-enhancing antibodies or harmful immune or inflammatory responses. currently, an inactivated sars-cov vaccine is in clinical trials in china, but safety is the major concern for this type of vaccine, as it may induce antibodies that enhance infection by early human sars-cov and animal sars-cov-like viruses. the s protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov. recombinant vector-based vaccines expressing full-length s protein of the late sars-cov are under development, but these vaccines may induce antibodies that enhance infection by early human sars-cov and animal sars-cov-like viruses. recent studies have demonstrated that recombinant rbd, a fragment of the s protein consisting of multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes, can be used as a safe and efficacious vaccine for preventing infection by sars-cov with distinct genotypes, as unlike full-length s protein, rbd does not contain immunodominant sites that induce nonneutralizing antibodies, and rbd sequences are relatively conserved. the s protein with truncation at aa 1153 failed to cause antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, although it still induced neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that removal of the aa 1153–1194 region may abrogate induction of virus infection-enhancing antibodies.\n",
      "  [2] a previously unknown sars virus genome sequence, named sars-cov-cpsr-19, was discovered in the sars-cov genome. this sequence is located in the orf3b gene of the sars-cov ma15 genome and is a 22-nt dna complemented palindrome  tctttaacaagcttgttaaaga . sars-cov-cpsr-19 was found to significantly induce cell apoptosis, which is a key feature in sars-cov infection or pathogenesis. this was confirmed through rna interference  rnai  experiments, as well as by measuring the expression levels of cell apoptosis marker genes and long non-coding rnas  lncrnas  from mitochondrial genomes. sars-cov-cpsr-19 was discovered to play a role in sars-cov infection or pathogenesis, as it can form one hairpin and its tm  melting temperature  is around 20 °c. this suggests that most of sars-cov-cpsr-19 cannot be ligated to adapters during the small rna  srna -seq library preparation process at room temperature  ~20 °c . the discovery of sars-cov-cpsr-19 and its role in sars-cov infection or pathogenesis provides insights into the mechanisms underlying viral infection or pathogenesis, as well as the potential interaction between viruses and host cells. however, the exact mechanisms underlying the infection or pathogenesis of both sars-cov-cpsr-19 and another sars virus small viral rna named svrna-n are still unknown.\n",

      "  [2] the willingness of healthcare workers in hong kong to accept pre-pandemic influenza vaccination is low, with a response rate of below 50%. this is consistent with the low acceptance of seasonal influenza vaccination among healthcare workers worldwide, where only 32.9% of healthcare workers in hong kong and 15.6% of healthcare workers in the uk would accept pre-pandemic vaccination during the sars outbreak. the main barriers to vaccination identified in this study are fear of side effects and doubts about the efficacy of the vaccines. a history of seasonal influenza vaccination and perceived likelihood of being infected are also associated with the intention to accept vaccination. the study highlights that efforts to improve the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination by healthcare workers should be a part of pandemic preparedness plans, as disseminating correct information may be more difficult during crises. the study suggests that public health agencies should provide more information to staff, especially to those with higher levels of anxiety and doubt. the study found that younger staff and staff with less than five years of working experience are more willing to accept vaccination. however, this does not necessarily indicate that the experience of the sars outbreak enhanced the willingness to accept the vaccination. the study also found that the uptake rate for seasonal influenza vaccine among elderly people in hong kong varies among the target groups, and more than 90% of elderly people in institutions received influenza vaccine delivered on site. the study suggests that there are common barriers to influenza vaccination that exist across geographical regions and racial groups. the study highlights that campaigns to promote vaccination should consider addressing the knowledge gap of staff and the specific target groups for intervention. the study also suggests that further qualitative studies, such as focus group discussions or semi-structured interviews, should be conducted to consolidate and supplement the findings. the study concludes that a successful vaccination strategy should not only protect the health of healthcare workers but also limit the transmission between the health sector and the community, as a lesson from the sars outbreak.\n",

      "  #   [0] as of march 2015, there have been 1102 laboratory-confirmed cases of mers-cov, with a case fatality rate of 37.7%. most cases  973  have been reported in saudi arabia and other countries in the arabian peninsula, with cases reported outside the region linked to travel to or from the area. mers-cov belongs to the c lineage of the genus betacoronavirus, with the taphozous perforatus as a probable natural reservoir. bat guano, saliva, and/or urine contaminate food and water resources in areas with palm orchards, potentially serving as an indirect source of transmission to camels, people, and other animals. dipeptidyl peptidase 4  dpp4 , also known as cd26, is the functional receptor for mers-cov. the virus can cause severe respiratory illness, particularly in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, although asymptomatic and mild cases have also been reported. co-infection with other pathogens, including influenza a, parainfluenza, herpes simplex, and pneumococcus, has been reported in mers-cov cases. the annual mortality associated with mers-cov is lower than that of many other viruses that induce acute viral infections, such as seasonal flu, rotavirus, measles, rabies, yellow fever virus, dengue fever virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and lassa fever virus. the virus is prone to replicate efficiently in primate, pig, and goat cell cultures, but people in direct contact with camels are at the most risk of contracting mers-cov infection, with other possible indirect contact including the consumption of unpasteurized camel milk. mers-cov positive sera has been found in samples from as early as 1983 in somalia and sudan, indicating that the virus has been circulating for at least 31 years in the horn of africa countries without causing large-scale fatalities in humans.\n",
      "  [1] mers-cov is a novel beta coronavirus that causes severe respiratory illness, with a high case fatality rate. it was first identified in 2012 in a patient in saudi arabia, and has since spread to over 20 countries. the transmission of mers-cov is less efficient than that of sars-cov, but the mortality rate is higher, at around 35-50%. the clinical features of mers-cov are similar to those of other severe viral pneumonias, such as sars-cov and pandemic influenza, but mers-cov is more likely to cause acute renal failure. mers-cov is primarily spread through close contact with symptomatic individuals or patients, and infection control precautions, including the use of masks and hand hygiene, are important in reducing transmission. the prognosis for mers-cov is guarded, with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome  ards  leading to high mortality rates, particularly in those with comorbidities.\n",

      "  #   [0] the viral shedding pattern of sars-cov is different from that of other respiratory viruses, with respiratory shedding peaking during the second week and lasting for more than 6 weeks in some cases. stool shedding also occurs later than expected, with the ability to detect virus in stool specimens peaking at the beginning of the second week and remaining high over weeks 3-4. the diagnostic yield of different specimen types varies for sars-cov, with throat washing samples being the most inferior respiratory specimens. pooled throat and nasal swab specimens provide a higher diagnostic yield compared with nasopharyngeal aspirates. a combination of stool sample and pooled throat and nasal swab specimens should be the specimens of choice for a safe and high-yield sars-cov detection. sars-cov can survive for at least 2-4 days at room temperature when mixed with diarrheal or normal stool specimens, and the poor isolation rate from stool may be due to the presence of toxic substances in stool or rectal swab samples or the possibility of viral growth interference due to the presence of immunoglobulin  ig a antibodies. positive virologic results are associated with more adverse outcomes in sars-cov patients, potentially confounded by the fact that only high-yield specimens, such as tracheal aspirate, can be obtained from intubated patients. the ability to accurately diagnose sars-cov infection needs improvement, with options including the inclusion of levels of viremia in the diagnostic algorithm, the development of a sars-cov-specific monoclonal antibody for detecting virus-infected cells from respiratory samples, and the development of an assay to detect viral antigens from stool samples as is available for rotavirus detection. the unusual shedding pattern of sars-cov should also be considered when formulating infection control strategies.\n",
      "  [1] in a mouse model, a single high dose of mdef201 administered 8 weeks prior to infection with vaccinia virus provides a high degree of protection from death, with similar effects seen with lower doses administered 1 day before infection  extended prophylaxis . against vaccinia virus lri, mdef201 delivered to the nasal sinus requires a 10-fold higher dose than that delivered to the lungs in order to protect equally against body weight loss during the infection. in the case of cowpox virus infection, lower doses of mdef201 are less effective, requiring higher doses for efficacy against this virus strain. the extended prophylactic effect of mdef201 against vaccinia virus infections in mice is remarkably long, lasting at least 8 weeks after administration. the adenovirus vector used to deliver mdef201 is still present in the snouts of mdef201-treated mice 60 days after exposure, suggesting that the extended prophylactic effect may exist in the absence of measurable serum interferon levels.\n",
      "  [2] a review by hemila et al.  2013  found that therapeutic doses of vitamin c  0.2g/day or more  can shorten the duration of the common cold, but with no statistical significance due to heterogeneity related to sex and dosage. however, studies by elwood pc and tyrrell da indicated that mere therapeutic doses of vitamin c are effective in men rather than women, reducing the main duration, nasal congestion or running nose, and limb and muscle pain. vitamin c is the most effective water-soluble antioxidant in human plasma, concentrated in leukocytes, and its concentration rapidly declines during infections and stress. vitamin c supplementation improves the ability to resist infection by improving the activities of the immune system, such as antimicrobial and natural killer cell activities, lymphocyte proliferation, chemotaxis, and delayed-type hypersensitivity. it also contributes to hormone regulation, including activation of the sympathetic nervous system and secretion of epinephrine during abnormal stress. the combination of supplemental and therapeutic doses of vitamin c is capable of relieving chest pain, fever, and chills, as well as shortening the time of confinement indoors and mean duration. data availability  all data are contained within the paper. a large dose of vitamin c during the common cold, usually 3.0g/day to 4.0g/day, can better recover health, while administration of extra doses of vitamin c at the onset of a common cold can help reduce the duration by about half a day, shorten the time confined indoors by about 10 hours, and relieve symptoms of a common cold, including chest pain, fever, and chills. language limitations weakened the exactness and representativeness of the study's data, as in some cases, the data had to be calculated and transformed rather than being available directly. therapeutic rcts must be conducted according to stricter, more precise guidelines to gain more knowledge on this subject. conflicts of interest  the authors declare no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.\n",
      "  [3] the study estimated that the mean incubation period for human avian influenza a h7n9  virus infections in china during 2013-2014 was approximately 3.4 days, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.9 to 3.7 days. the study found that all of the 2-parameter distributions  gamma, weibull, lognormal, exponential, and log-logistic  provided reasonable fits in comparison with the nonparametric estimate of the incubation period distribution, with the best-fitting parametric distribution being the weibull distribution. the study compared published estimates of the incubation period distribution and found generally higher estimates from studies that used the midpoint approximation, compared with other studies based on restricted sample sizes or single exposure data. the study showed that the incubation period estimates were consistent with smaller-sample-size studies based on parametric methods with interval exposure data, as well as with estimates based on inference from ecological data. the study recommended a 7-day observation period for exposed persons, as 97% and 99% of cases, respectively, would show symptoms within those periods.\n",

      "  [3] the study isolated influenza a viruses subtypes h4n6 and h4n9 from ducks in a live bird market in bangkok, thailand, and both viruses had never been reported in thailand before. the whole genome sequences of the viruses were determined and submitted to respective databases, revealing that gene segments of the viruses were derived from the eurasian lineage and displayed low pathogenic characteristics with amino acids specific to avian influenza viruses. the study's genetic analysis showed that the viruses display amino acid changes at the receptor-binding site, which could alter biological functions and potentially affect virus transmission among birds and humans. the study's findings indicate that live bird markets can serve as an early warning system for influenza a virus evolution and highlight the significance of hosts, environments, and potential virus reassortment, especially in live bird markets. the study's findings suggest that educational campaigns, disinfection of fomites in live bird markets, and creating a rest day to interrupt the flow system could help prevent and control influenza a virus infection in live bird markets.\n",
      "  [4] public health emergencies are more common than many americans realize, with examples including the 2009 h1n1 pandemic, 2012 mers outbreak, and 2014 ebola crisis. president trump's past tweets on public health emergencies raise concerns that his initial reactions may define policy without consulting scientific and medical authorities. quarantines must be carefully tailored and applied to halt and prevent the spread of communicable diseases, with overly broad imposition leading to a disincentive for healthcare workers to travel to infected zones and administer life-saving healthcare. without quick responses to public health emergencies, diseases such as ebola can spread globally and potentially continue to spread for years. combat of infectious disease at its source is vital to keeping americans safe, with successful containment of the disease being necessary for preventing the spread of diseases globally.\n",

      "  #   [0] inhibition of sars-cov-induced cpe in vero cells by sirna  the study found that out of the six vector-based sirnas, only two, psr02 and psr03, could effectively block sars-cov replication in vero cells. both of these sirnas target the rna polymerase, which suggests their potential as alternatives for vaccines against sars-cov. sequence conservation in different sars-cov strains  the target sequences of psr02 and psr03, which can efficiently inhibit sars-cov replication, are conserved in all the sars-cov strains published in the genbank database. this sequence conservation between different sars-cov strains may avoid the possibility that the sequence variation between different sars-cov strains may restrict sirna inhibitory effects. effectiveness of vaccine  vaccine is one of the most effective ways to interfere with viral infection. however, genetic mutation in the segments encoding the major antigenic proteins may pose potential problems for the development of effective vaccines due to sequence variation between different sars-cov strains. nonspecific double-stranded rnas  the study noted that exogenously introduced plasmids can lead to the generation of nonspecific double-stranded rnas, which in turn induce interferon production and inhibit viral replication to some extent. vector selection  the vector psr was selected as an sirna expression vector as it can be used to generate recombinant retroviruses, which has been shown to be effective in most cell lines and many primary cell types and provides great facility for further clinical application studies. rapid mutations  the variations of s protein among strains of sars-cov pose potential problems for the development of effective vaccines due to sequence variation between different sars-cov strains. rapid mutations in the segments encoding the major antigenic proteins may lead to antigenic protein sequence variation between different sars-cov strains, which may restrict sirna inhibitory effects. target sequence selection  in order to avoid the possibility that the sequence variation between different sars-cov strains may restrict sirna inhibitory effects, the target sequences were chosen with consideration given to sequence conservation between\n",
      "  [1] an ideal sars-cov vaccine should elicit highly potent neutralizing antibody responses against a broad spectrum of viral strains, induce protection against infection and transmission, and be safe by not inducing any infection-enhancing antibodies or harmful immune or inflammatory responses. currently, an inactivated sars-cov vaccine is in clinical trials in china, but safety is the major concern for this type of vaccine, as it may induce antibodies that enhance infection by early human sars-cov and animal sars-cov-like viruses. the s protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov. recombinant vector-based vaccines expressing full-length s protein of the late sars-cov are under development, but these vaccines may induce antibodies that enhance infection by early human sars-cov and animal sars-cov-like viruses. recent studies have demonstrated that recombinant rbd, a fragment of the s protein consisting of multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes, can be used as a safe and efficacious vaccine for preventing infection by sars-cov with distinct genotypes, as unlike full-length s protein, rbd does not contain immunodominant sites that induce nonneutralizing antibodies, and rbd sequences are relatively conserved. the s protein with truncation at aa 1153 failed to cause antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, although it still induced neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that removal of the aa 1153–1194 region may abrogate induction of virus infection-enhancing antibodies.\n",
      "  [2] a previously unknown sars virus genome sequence, named sars-cov-cpsr-19, was discovered in the sars-cov genome. this sequence is located in the orf3b gene of the sars-cov ma15 genome and is a 22-nt dna complemented palindrome  tctttaacaagcttgttaaaga . sars-cov-cpsr-19 was found to significantly induce cell apoptosis, which is a key feature in sars-cov infection or pathogenesis. this was confirmed through rna interference  rnai  experiments, as well as by measuring the expression levels of cell apoptosis marker genes and long non-coding rnas  lncrnas  from mitochondrial genomes. sars-cov-cpsr-19 was discovered to play a role in sars-cov infection or pathogenesis, as it can form one hairpin and its tm  melting temperature  is around 20 °c. this suggests that most of sars-cov-cpsr-19 cannot be ligated to adapters during the small rna  srna -seq library preparation process at room temperature  ~20 °c . the discovery of sars-cov-cpsr-19 and its role in sars-cov infection or pathogenesis provides insights into the mechanisms underlying viral infection or pathogenesis, as well as the potential interaction between viruses and host cells. however, the exact mechanisms underlying the infection or pathogenesis of both sars-cov-cpsr-19 and another sars virus small viral rna named svrna-n are still unknown.\n",
      "  [3] the study identified two distinct receptor-binding domains  rbds  in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 viruses  the original rbd, which binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ace2 , and a second rbd, which binds to bat ace2 orthologs. the researchers found that a previously uncharacterized bat ace2 ortholog, bat ace2b, can also serve as a functional receptor for sars-cov-2 viruses, but with lower affinity compared to the ortholog from the horse shrew  rhinolophus ferrumequinum  or chinese horseshoe bat  rhinolophus sinensis . the study showed that the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2, but not that of sars-cov, can be cleaved by transmembrane serine protease 2  tmprss2  expressed in human airway epithelial cells, which is a prerequisite for efficient virus entry into human cells. the researchers found that the spike protein of sars-cov-2, but not that of sars-cov, can be cleaved by cathepsin l  ctl  in human cells, which is another prerequisite for efficient virus entry into human cells. the study demonstrated that a human ace2-overexpressing cell line is permissive to infection by sars-cov-2 viruses, but not by sars-cov viruses, and that this cell line supports efficient replication of sars-cov-2 viruses.\n",
      "  [4] the current pedv strains isolated in china have significant genetic variation from both the vaccine strains and previous strains, suggesting a possible explanation for the nationwide outbreak and the poor efficacy of commercial vaccines. the current pedv strains have a high homology in their partial s, full orf3, and m genes, despite being clustered into different subgroups based on these genes. the current pedv strains have a significant hydrophobic alternation in the s glycoprotein, induced by a 4–9 aa mutations in the neutralizing epitope region, which could provide one explanation for the poor immunity. the current pedv strains have a different hydrophobicity in their m protein compared to the attenuated pedv dr13 and vaccine strain cv777, which might be due to their adaptability and viral replication. the current pedv strains have a mutation at aa 13  e → q  in the m protein, which would have affected the hydrophobicity of the m protein, but the function of this mutation requires further investigation.\n",

      "  [1] inhibition of sars-cov-induced cpe in vero cells by sirna  the study found that out of the six vector-based sirnas, only two, psr02 and psr03, could effectively block sars-cov replication in vero cells. both of these sirnas target the rna polymerase, which suggests their potential as alternatives for vaccines against sars-cov. sequence conservation in different sars-cov strains  the target sequences of psr02 and psr03, which can efficiently inhibit sars-cov replication, are conserved in all the sars-cov strains published in the genbank database. this sequence conservation between different sars-cov strains may avoid the possibility that the sequence variation between different sars-cov strains may restrict sirna inhibitory effects. effectiveness of vaccine  vaccine is one of the most effective ways to interfere with viral infection. however, genetic mutation in the segments encoding the major antigenic proteins may pose potential problems for the development of effective vaccines due to sequence variation between different sars-cov strains. nonspecific double-stranded rnas  the study noted that exogenously introduced plasmids can lead to the generation of nonspecific double-stranded rnas, which in turn induce interferon production and inhibit viral replication to some extent. vector selection  the vector psr was selected as an sirna expression vector as it can be used to generate recombinant retroviruses, which has been shown to be effective in most cell lines and many primary cell types and provides great facility for further clinical application studies. rapid mutations  the variations of s protein among strains of sars-cov pose potential problems for the development of effective vaccines due to sequence variation between different sars-cov strains. rapid mutations in the segments encoding the major antigenic proteins may lead to antigenic protein sequence variation between different sars-cov strains, which may restrict sirna inhibitory effects. target sequence selection  in order to avoid the possibility that the sequence variation between different sars-cov strains may restrict sirna inhibitory effects, the target sequences were chosen with consideration given to sequence conservation between\n",
      "  [2] the structural analysis of sars-cov receptor interactions has revealed that critical residue changes in sars-cov and host receptor proteins present major species barriers for viral infections and determine host range and cross-species transmission. sars-cov adapted to civet and human ace2 proteins by strengthening the binding affinity to their receptors through mutations in the receptor-binding domain  rbd  of its spike protein. mice support sars-cov infection at low levels because of the k353h residue change in their ace2, but rats are resistant to sars-cov infection because of the k353h and m82n double residue changes. through natural evolutions of its rbd at key positions, sars-cov overcame the species barriers between some animal species, but not others. a structure-based prediction of future sars-cov evolution suggests that if sars-cov were given the opportunity to keep infecting humans and evolving in human cells, it could evolve into a human-optimized form with substantial affinity for human ace2.\n",

      "  [1] the liu-hui-wen model predicts that 15-30% of the world's population will be infected with covid-19, with the majority of infections occurring in asia. the covid-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in demand for laboratory services, including testing for covid-19 and other infectious diseases. the global laboratory network has been strengthened in response to the pandemic, with interconnected systems for rapid detection and containment of emerging threats, as well as for reassuring the public that it is safe to resume daily living activities. the pandemic has highlighted the importance of laboratory-based disease surveillance and response, as well as for restoring public confidence that postal and other facilities are not contaminated with covid-19. the pandemic has also underscored the need for continued and expanded partnerships between laboratories, government agencies, and other organizations for strategic discussions on how best to meet the overarching goals of \"prevent, detect, and respond\".\n",

      "  [1] strongly associated with influenza vaccination uptake among adults aged 50-64 in hong kong are being eligible for free government vaccine, willingness to receive flu vaccination for free, perceiving severe or moderate symptoms when contracting flu, and convenience of reaching a vaccination location. the majority of cases  80.8%  and controls  93.9%  were not aware that they belong to a recommended group for influenza vaccination, indicating a lack of awareness about the recommended priority group for vaccination. most  >80%  cases and controls were willing to be vaccinated if it was free, indicating a high demand for free vaccination. being a part of the recommended priority group for influenza vaccination, being eligible for free government vaccine, and being willing to receive flu vaccination for free are the most significant factors associated with vaccination uptake among adults aged 50-64 in hong kong. perceiving severe or moderate symptoms when contracting flu and convenience of reaching a vaccination location also have a comparatively strong association with influenza vaccination uptake among this age group.\n",
      "  [2] the willingness of healthcare workers in hong kong to accept pre-pandemic influenza vaccination is low, with a response rate of below 50%. this is consistent with the low acceptance of seasonal influenza vaccination among healthcare workers worldwide, where only 32.9% of healthcare workers in hong kong and 15.6% of healthcare workers in the uk would accept pre-pandemic vaccination during the sars outbreak. the main barriers to vaccination identified in this study are fear of side effects and doubts about the efficacy of the vaccines. a history of seasonal influenza vaccination and perceived likelihood of being infected are also associated with the intention to accept vaccination. the study highlights that efforts to improve the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination by healthcare workers should be a part of pandemic preparedness plans, as disseminating correct information may be more difficult during crises. the study suggests that public health agencies should provide more information to staff, especially to those with higher levels of anxiety and doubt. the study found that younger staff and staff with less than five years of working experience are more willing to accept vaccination. however, this does not necessarily indicate that the experience of the sars outbreak enhanced the willingness to accept the vaccination. the study also found that the uptake rate for seasonal influenza vaccine among elderly people in hong kong varies among the target groups, and more than 90% of elderly people in institutions received influenza vaccine delivered on site. the study suggests that there are common barriers to influenza vaccination that exist across geographical regions and racial groups. the study highlights that campaigns to promote vaccination should consider addressing the knowledge gap of staff and the specific target groups for intervention. the study also suggests that further qualitative studies, such as focus group discussions or semi-structured interviews, should be conducted to consolidate and supplement the findings. the study concludes that a successful vaccination strategy should not only protect the health of healthcare workers but also limit the transmission between the health sector and the community, as a lesson from the sars outbreak.\n",
      "  [3] the current hepatitis a outbreak in korea highlights the need for fundamental changes and advancements in the public health system in the country. this is due to the country's low level of immunity in the adult population, high population density, and increased risks of outbreaks of new types of infectious diseases or healthcare-related infection, resulting from factors such as close contact in schools and workplaces, high healthcare services utilization, cultural habits of eating out with company, and shellfish aquafarming. to prevent hepatitis a outbreaks, three basic policies can be implemented  eliminating infectious agents by identifying and isolating hepatitis a patients who are the source of viral spread, blocking the spread of infection by removing or disinfecting contaminated water, food, and tools used in daily life by susceptible individuals, and increasing immunity among people at risk of infection. natural immunity, acquired through infection at a young age, is currently difficult to acquire in korea due to the country's low incidence of hepatitis a. as a result, large-scale vaccination is a cost-effective measure in countries, such as korea, with a high incidence of hepatitis a, as many people tend to be infected when they are young, and even lower in urban areas. the immunity levels are relatively low among koreans born in the 1970s to 1990s and even lower in urban areas, resulting in a high hepatitis a fatality rate in future outbreaks. therefore, a long-term plan of five years or more is required for organizations such as public health centers to provide adult vaccines at a lower cost than that of private hospitals to provide an alternative for those who are not vaccinated due to cost. the introduction of timely infant vaccination should be considered to improve herd immunity in certain age groups, and a vaccination registration record system may be needed to provide adequate measures for effective control of hepatitis a outbreaks. the establishment and implementation of a long-term plan of five years or more can help overcome hurdles such as securing budgets, vaccine supply, and low vaccination rates.\n",
      "  [4] despite global efforts, measles remains a leading cause of death among children, highlighting the need for targeted vaccination campaigns. vaccination coverage, susceptible birth cohort, and the effective reproductive ratio  re  should be considered when prioritizing sub-national areas for vaccination campaigns. estimated vaccination coverage varies widely, with some areas below 80%, highlighting the need for supplemental vaccination activities. large urban centers with high vaccination coverage may have high birth cohort sizes, indicating the need for targeted vaccination efforts. the estimated re ranged from 1 to 2.56, highlighting the need for prioritization based on local reproductive ratios. the spatial scale of prioritization should be considered, as areas may be prioritized differently based on the measure used. certain areas may be prioritized by all three metrics, requiring particular attention during vaccination campaigns.\n",

      "  [2] in a study of 2,207 children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, those with rhinovirus had higher odds of receiving corticosteroids in both the emergency department and during hospitalization compared to those with rsv alone or rsv/rhinovirus coinfection. children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis were more likely to be older, have a history of wheezing and eczema, and receive corticosteroids compared to those with rsv-associated bronchiolitis. the differential treatment of children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis suggests that bronchiolitis is a heterogeneous respiratory illness with potential subgroups that may respond differently to medications. most medication trials for children hospitalized with bronchiolitis require children to be age <12 months and have no history of wheezing, but the present data suggest that these trials should be repeated in children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis. until better case definitions and outcomes for children with lower respiratory infection are developed, clinicians will continue to use asthma exacerbation medications based on intuition rather than scientific data.\n",
      "  [3] the patient, a 6-year-old girl, presented with extrapulmonary manifestations of mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, notably involving the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, heart, joints, skin, and blood cells. this is a rare finding in the pediatric population, with gastrointestinal manifestations accounting for 25% of m. pneumoniae infections in children. the patient developed symptoms of cough and sputum two days before the onset of symptoms, including epigastric pain, vomiting, and fever. these symptoms followed the day after the initial m. pneumoniae infection. the patient's mental status changed from alert to drowsy, and was therefore transferred to the hospital. this finding suggests the development of acute necrotizing pancreatitis, which is a severe form of acute pancreatitis. the patient's initial laboratory tests revealed abnormal levels of sodium, decreased to 123 meq/l, and elevation of amylase to 1,570 u/l, and lipase to 2,860 u/l. these findings indicate the presence of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. the patient's initial abdominal computed tomography  ct  scans revealed necrosis of the pancreas body and tail and a portal vein thrombus of 2 cm observed in the main portal vein. bilateral pleural effusions were also observed on ct scans. these findings suggest the presence of severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis associated with m. pneumoniae infection in the pediatric population.\n",

# Contexts:\\n  #   [0] as of february 20, 2020, there have been over 72,000 confirmed cases of covid-19, with the majority in china. discrimination and prejudice, driven by fear or misinformation, have emerged in response to the outbreak. this has resulted in innocent people in china being unfairly blamed, and similar incidents have occurred in other countries. the formal names for the virus and disease have been established by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses and the world health organization, respectively. the outbreak has highlighted the negative side of human societies, as prejudice and bigotry have occurred with each huge epidemic in history. fear, prejudice, and discrimination can impede anti-covid-19 efforts, as they can discourage people from seeking medical help and prevent effective control measures from being implemented. open and transparent information, as well as administrative warnings, are necessary to reduce fear and discrimination.\\n  [1] the liu-hui-wen model predicts that 15-30% of the world\\'s population will be infected with covid-19, with the majority of infections occurring in asia. the covid-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in demand for laboratory services, including testing for covid-19 and other infectious diseases. the global laboratory network has been strengthened in response to the pandemic, with interconnected systems for rapid detection and containment of emerging threats, as well as for reassuring the public that it is safe to resume daily living activities. the pandemic has highlighted the importance of laboratory-based disease surveillance and response, as well as for restoring public confidence that postal and other facilities are not contaminated with covid-19. the pandemic has also underscored the need for continued and expanded partnerships between laboratories, government agencies, and other organizations for strategic discussions on how best to meet the overarching goals of \"prevent, detect, and respond\".\\n  [2] study examined twitter for public health surveillance during a mass gathering in canada with two objectives  to explore feasibility of acquiring, categorizing, and using geolocated twitter data, and to compare twitter data against other data sources used for pan parapan american games  p/pag  surveillance. syndrome definitions were created using keyword categorization to extract posts from twitter. categories were developed iteratively for four relevant syndromes  respiratory, gastrointestinal, heat-related illness, and influenza-like illness  ili . cross-correlation analyses of time series data were conducted between twitter and comparator surveillance data sources  emergency department visits, telephone helpline calls, laboratory testing positivity rate, reportable disease data, and temperature. significant correlations were found between twitter data and two routine data sources for heat alerts  telephone helpline calls  r=0.4  and temperature data  r=0.5 . study concluded that using simple syndromes based on keyword classification of geolocated tweets, they found a correlation between tweets and two routine data sources for heat alerts, the only public health event detected during p/pag. further research is needed to understand the role for twitter in surveillance.\\n  [3] the study isolated influenza a viruses subtypes h4n6 and h4n9 from ducks in a live bird market in bangkok, thailand, and both viruses had never been reported in thailand before. the whole genome sequences of the viruses were determined and submitted to respective databases, revealing that gene segments of the viruses were derived from the eurasian lineage and displayed low pathogenic characteristics with amino acids specific to avian influenza viruses. the study\\'s genetic analysis showed that the viruses display amino acid changes at the receptor-binding site, which could alter biological functions and potentially affect virus transmission among birds and humans. the study\\'s findings indicate that live bird markets can serve as an early warning system for influenza a virus evolution and highlight the significance of hosts, environments, and potential virus reassortment, especially in live bird markets. the study\\'s findings suggest that educational campaigns, disinfection of fomites in live bird markets, and creating a rest day to interrupt the flow system could help prevent and control influenza a virus infection in live bird markets.\\n  [4] public health emergencies are more common than many americans realize, with examples including the 2009 h1n1 pandemic, 2012 mers outbreak, and 2014 ebola crisis. president trump\\'s past tweets on public health emergencies raise concerns that his initial reactions may define policy without consulting scientific and medical authorities. quarantines must be carefully tailored and applied to halt and prevent the spread of communicable diseases, with overly broad imposition leading to a disincentive for healthcare workers to travel to infected zones and administer life-saving healthcare. without quick responses to public health emergencies, diseases such as ebola can spread globally and potentially continue to spread for years. combat of infectious disease at its source is vital to keeping americans safe, with successful containment of the disease being necessary for preventing the spread of diseases globally.\\n\\n  # Question: Summarize 20 key findings **strictly from the provided contexts** that are **relevant to
