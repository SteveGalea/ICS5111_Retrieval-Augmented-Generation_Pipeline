"A new monoclonal antibody (mab), f90g5-3, was developed against the botulinum neurotoxins (Bnts) A, B, C, and D using recombinant Bnt/A toxoids as immunogens.",PMC3278809,PMC3278809_0
"The mab, f90g5-3, binds to a linear epitope (985wtlqdtqeikqrvvf999) within the hcn25/A subdomain of botulinum neurotoxin A (Bnt/A) with nanomolar affinity and is highly immunoreactive in humans.",PMC3278809,PMC3278809_1
"The immunogenicity of the minimal target (985wtlqdtqeikqrvvf999) remains unknown, but the hybridoma f90g5-3 is of potential value as a diagnostic immunoreagent for Bnt/A capture assay development and bioforensic analysis.",PMC3278809,PMC3278809_2
"The mab, f90g5-3, is specific for Bnt/A and bound to a specific epitope region of Bnt/A with high affinity, and this epitope target is highly immunoreactive in humans.",PMC3278809,PMC3278809_3
"The study reveals the first minimal mab epitope (985wtlqdtqeikqrvvf999) mapped to this small domain for f90g5-3, and the findings suggest that f90g5-3 is of potential value as a diagnostic immunoreagent for Bnt/A capture assay development and bioforensic analysis.",PMC3278809,PMC3278809_4
