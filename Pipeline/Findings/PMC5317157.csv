"A study conducted in Singapore found that a new platform called pathchip, developed by the Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS), can detect viral respiratory pathogens beyond what is covered by traditional multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels used for respiratory infections. The study analyzed 184 respiratory samples from a community-acquired respiratory infection cohort and 114 samples from hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection. The platform automatically detects which pathogens' recognition signatures are present based on a proprietary algorithm constructed based on genetic sequences of viruses clinically relevant to humans.",PMC5317157,PMC5317157_0
"The study found that the platform can detect 12 viruses, including influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, parainfluenza virus 1, parainfluenza virus 2, parainfluenza virus 3, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus A/B, adenovirus A/B/C/D/E, and human coronaviruses 229E/NL63 and human coronaviruses OC43.",PMC5317157,PMC5317157_1
"The study compared the ability of standard PCR and multiplex PCR to detect influenza in terms of days post-onset and cycle threshold values. The study found that the GIS-pathchip can add to detection above routinely available multiplex PCR assays, and viruses were grouped into panel viruses, non-panel viruses for which ari is a common presentation, and non-ari viruses.",PMC5317157,PMC5317157_2
The study compared the discriminatory performance by calculating the positive likelihood ratio (lr+) and its 95% confidence intervals (ci) for positive detection of influenza and any viral infection. The study also investigated the effect of age on the discriminatory performance.,PMC5317157,PMC5317157_3
"The study found that the proportion of episodes fulfilling different criteria was compared by viral pathogen status, and estimates of lr+ require assumptions on the anticipated prevalence of influenza. For community-acquired respiratory infection, this was assumed to be what was obtained in ari samples from the community cohort. For hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection, since influenza-positive inpatients were intentionally overs",PMC5317157,PMC5317157_4
