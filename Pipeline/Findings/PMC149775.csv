"In the context of the study on coronavirus, the authors discovered that the envelope protein m of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus interacts specifically and selectively with a viral cis-acting RNA element called the ps, independently of the nucleocapsid protein n, during viral genome packaging into virus-like particles (VLPs). This finding challenges the current understanding that n protein binds to all MERS coronavirus mRNAs, including the ps, in infected cells and suggests a novel paradigm for viral genome packaging, in which the selective interaction of m protein with ps determines the exclusivity of viral RNA packaging into VLPs, in the absence of n protein.",PMC149775,PMC149775_0
"The authors showed that MERS coronavirus nonstructural proteins are not necessary for RNA packaging into VLPs, as MERS coronavirus VLPs were produced in cells coexpressing the synthetic MERS coronavirus di RNA containing the ps and all four (m, n, s, and e) MERS coronavirus structural proteins, despite the lack of any MERS coronavirus ps sequences. This finding challenges the current understanding that viral RNAs are randomly incorporated into VLPs in other expression systems and suggests an absolutely specific and selective nucleocapsid-independent RNA packaging mechanism in MERS coronavirus.",PMC149775,PMC149775_1
"The authors demonstrated that MERS coronavirus VLPs produced in cells coexpressing MERS coronavirus RNA containing the ps and m and e proteins were indistinguishable from authentic MERS coronavirus VLPs in terms of their morphology, size, and buoyant density, and contained the ps-containing RNA transcripts selectively and exclusively, in the absence of n protein.",PMC149775,PMC149775_2
"The authors proposed a model to elucidate the mechanism of RNA packaging in MERS coronavirus based on their findings and other studies, which suggests that m protein, which accumulates and probably oligomerizes in the intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi complex, binds specifically to the ps present in mRNA 1, determines the selective genomic RNA packaging, and excludes the packaging of MERS coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs lacking the ps. N protein, which is associated with mRNA 1, interacts with",PMC149775,PMC149775_3
