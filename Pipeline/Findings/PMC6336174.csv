"In a study of 75 children with viral respiratory infections admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations were found to have a high negative predictive value for identifying bacterial coinfection, with a threshold concentration of 1.4 ng/mL demonstrating the best utility.",PMC6336174,PMC6336174_0
"The study found that PCT concentrations, particularly a second PCT value, helped to correctly influence treatment decisions in 44% of cases by stopping or not starting antimicrobials in patients with consecutive low PCT values or continuing antimicrobials in patients with consecutive high PCT values who subsequently had a confirmed bacterial infection.",PMC6336174,PMC6336174_1
"The study found that PCT concentrations were useful in identifying bacterial coinfection, particularly in the case of viral lower respiratory tract infection, and supported the idea that PCT may aid clinicians in ruling out bacterial coinfection in this setting.",PMC6336174,PMC6336174_2
"The study found that serial PCT concentrations may help further influence correct treatment decisions, although the small sample size of the serial PCT patients limits the usefulness of the data obtained from this subgroup, and prospective, controlled studies are warranted to validate an appropriate PCT threshold concentration and further explore the role of serial PCT in determining the absence or presence of a bacterial coinfection.",PMC6336174,PMC6336174_3
"The study found that while PCT concentrations were high in some patients without confirmed bacterial infection, this could be a result of the lack of a good ""gold standard"" methodology for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia, and that none of these signs and symptoms are specific to a bacterial source or a viral source of infection, which makes overtreating with antimicrobials common and the need for better diagnostic measurements paramount.",PMC6336174,PMC6336174_4
