Prevalence: Clostridium difficile was isolated from 6.7% of diarrhoeic dogs and 4.2% of faecal samples from exotic animals.,PMC5845233,PMC5845233_0
"Ribotypes: Four known ribotypes (RTs) were detected in dogs (010, 014, 123, and 358), and a new RT was found in an exotic animal. This new RT was negative for all toxin genes tested and belonged to sequence type 347, which has been proposed as a clade-iii member.",PMC5845233,PMC5845233_1
"Antimicrobial Resistance: Two dog strains showed a stable resistance to metronidazole, with initial MIC values of 128 and 48 Î¼g/ml.",PMC5845233,PMC5845233_2
"Molecular Studies: The study suggests implementing antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance programs to assess the prevalence of metronidazole resistance in dogs, as well as further genomic studies on the uncommon C. Difficile strains found in exotic animals.",PMC5845233,PMC5845233_3
Zoonotic Transmission: The similarity between the RTs observed in dogs and those described in humans suggests further exploration of zoonotic transmission.,PMC5845233,PMC5845233_4
