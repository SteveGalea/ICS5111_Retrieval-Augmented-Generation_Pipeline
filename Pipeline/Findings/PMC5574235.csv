"In the context of the MERS-CoV epidemic, the authors identified two stable equilibria in a mathematical model that represents the spread of the virus. The first equilibrium, called the infection-free equilibrium, is asymptotically stable when the basic reproductive ratio, a measure of how easily a disease spreads in a population, is less than 1. The second equilibrium, called the infected equilibrium, is asymptotically stable when the basic reproductive ratio is greater than 1.",PMC5574235,PMC5574235_0
"The authors also found that when the basic reproductive ratio is between 1 and 1.2, the virus infection persists in the population, but at a lower level than when the basic reproductive ratio is greater than 1.",PMC5574235,PMC5574235_1
"In the context of a study on the interactions between the protein dpp4 and the virus infection, the authors used a mathematical model to investigate the effects of a drug treatment on the spread of the virus. They found that when the drug treatment is not applied, the virus infection is persistent in the population when the basic reproductive ratio is greater than 1. However, when the drug treatment is applied, the basic reproductive ratio decreases below 1, and the virus infection can be controlled.",PMC5574235,PMC5574235_2
"The authors also found that increasing the value of a parameter that represents the effectiveness of the drug treatment can change the value of the basic reproductive ratio from greater than 1 to less than 1, indicating that the virus infection can be controlled.",PMC5574235,PMC5574235_3
"In the context of a study on the effects of the Ebola virus on the immune system, the authors used a mathematical model to investigate the interactions between the virus and the immune system. They found that the virus infection can lead to a reduction in the activity of the immune system, but that this effect is temporary and does not result in long-term impairment of the immune system.",PMC5574235,PMC5574235_4
