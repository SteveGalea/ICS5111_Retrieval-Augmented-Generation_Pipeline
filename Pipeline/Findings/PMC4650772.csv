"The patient in Indiana had a prolonged period of systemic symptoms, including fever and myalgia, before developing respiratory symptoms, which is similar to the presentation of other mers-cov patients. However, the patient lacked upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract symptoms, which have been seen in approximately one-quarter of mers-cov patients.",PMC4650772,PMC4650772_0
"The patient's laboratory data were unremarkable except for a mild elevation in liver enzymes, which has been seen in up to 15% of mers-cov cases, and lymphopenia, which has been seen in 34%–86% of mers-cov cases.",PMC4650772,PMC4650772_1
"The virus was first detected in the patient's serum, and np swabs, because of their ease of collection, have been the most common sample used in making a diagnosis of mers-cov. However, despite having bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, the patient required supplemental oxygen only by nasal cannula and was able to be weaned to room air.",PMC4650772,PMC4650772_2
"The most closely genetically related strain to this patient's is from Riyadh in July 2013, which is where the Indiana patient lived and worked in a hospital. Of interest, the next most closely related virus is the June 2013 index case in a community cluster in Hafr Al-Batin, a town in northeast KSA near the Kuwaiti border, approximately 500 km from Riyadh (Supplementary Figure 1).",PMC4650772,PMC4650772_3
The ongoing threat of the spread of MERS-CoV into the United States requires the vigilance of astute clinicians and public health departments to detect MERS-CoV–infected patients and respond rapidly to prevent spread in healthcare facilities and the community. People who are traveling to provide healthcare services in the Arabian Peninsula should be familiar with recommendations for infection control of confirmed or suspected MERS cases.,PMC4650772,PMC4650772_4
