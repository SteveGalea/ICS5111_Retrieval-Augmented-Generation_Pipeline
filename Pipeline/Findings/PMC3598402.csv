"The study reports the first detection of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus in the Central African Republic (CAR). Five cases were identified between July and November 2010, and all patients were indigenous with no travel history or contact with infected individuals.",PMC3598402,PMC3598402_0
"The study found that influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 3, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were also responsible for respiratory illnesses in CAR, with most cases detected during the rainy season.",PMC3598402,PMC3598402_1
"The study observed a low prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with influenza-like illness (ILI), with viruses detected in only 14.9% of samples, which is lower than in other studies. This may be due to differences in epidemiology of viruses in CAR, different inclusion criteria, or detection techniques.",PMC3598402,PMC3598402_2
"The study found that bacterial infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, may still be the main causes of respiratory infections in CAR, as vaccines against these bacteria were only introduced recently.",PMC3598402,PMC3598402_3
"The study suggests that further studies are needed to confirm the burden of viral respiratory diseases in CAR, as the study was limited by its small sample size, which prevented the assessment of prevalence and associations.",PMC3598402,PMC3598402_4
