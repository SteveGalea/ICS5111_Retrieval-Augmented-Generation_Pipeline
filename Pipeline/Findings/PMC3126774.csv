"This study identified two peptide epitopes, ""k93fitsrcrl"" and ""f57gymtfvhf"", from the m protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) as h-2kd and h-2dd restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, respectively, in a mouse model.",PMC3126774,PMC3126774_0
"The study used a recombinant vaccinia virus, rWR-PRRSV-M, to drive m protein expression and revealed that rWR-PRRSV-M elicited specific antibody responses to m protein-derived peptides in mice vaccinated and boosted with rWR-PRRSV-M.",PMC3126774,PMC3126774_1
"The study found that dna vaccination, followed by a booster vaccination with rWR-PRRSV-M, elicited specific m protein-derived peptide responses in mice, indicating that dna vaccination can generate reagents for future investigations into CD8+ T cell responses during PRRSV infection and immunization.",PMC3126774,PMC3126774_2
"The study used a mouse model to identify PRRSV CTL epitopes in order to facilitate future investigations into CD8+ T cell responses during PRRSV infection and immunization, as specific peptide epitopes are known to be recognized by cytotoxic T cells in different animal species.",PMC3126774,PMC3126774_3
"The study developed a mouse model of PRRSV infection and this will contribute to a better understanding of the cell-mediated immune responses to PRRSV, as the identification of PRRSV CTL epitopes will enable the in-depth investigations of CD8+ T cell responses during PRRSV infection and immunization.",PMC3126774,PMC3126774_4
