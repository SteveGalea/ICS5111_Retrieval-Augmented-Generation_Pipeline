"The study found that sox2 expression is significantly increased in bcc tissues and cells, which is consistent with previous reports in other human cancer types.",PMC6341784,PMC6341784_0
The study revealed that sox2 promotes bcc cell migration and invasion through targeting the srpk1-mediated emt signaling pathway and the pi3k/akt signaling pathway.,PMC6341784,PMC6341784_1
"The study demonstrated that sox2 knockdown downregulated the expression of srpk1 and pi3k/akt signaling pathway, resulting in inhibition of bcc cell migration and invasion.",PMC6341784,PMC6341784_2
The study suggested that reduced expression of sox2 may lead to suppression of bcc metastasis.,PMC6341784,PMC6341784_3
"The study indicated that the srpk1/pi3k/akt pathway may be involved in the role of sox2 in the migration and invasion of bcc cells, making sox2 a potential novel therapeutic target for bcc.",PMC6341784,PMC6341784_4
