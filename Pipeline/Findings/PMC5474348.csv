"In the context of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected mice, regulatory T cells (tregs) play a critical role in suppressing the immune response, which helps to dampen immunopathology. However, their effects on virus clearance are complex, as their presence at early times after infection inhibits virus clearance, which results in more severe demyelination and clinical disease during the chronic phase.",PMC5474348,PMC5474348_0
"In MHV-infected mice, the host immune response is critical for virus clearance, as depletion of tregs or treatment with anti-IL-10 antibodies delays virus clearance, resulting in more virus-induced tissue damage. However, treatment with exogenous tregs during the chronic phase reduces inflammation and demyelination, suggesting that use of exogenous tregs in this setting requires careful consideration of the phase of the infection.",PMC5474348,PMC5474348_1
"In the context of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)-infected mice, higher numbers of tregs are present in the brains of susceptible mice compared to resistant mice. Treg depletion results in increased recruitment of T cells at early times after infection, with no effects on the kinetics of virus clearance or disease outcome. However, treatment with exogenous tregs during the chronic phase reduces inflammation and demyelination, suggesting that use of exogenous tregs in this setting requires careful consideration of the phase of the infection.",PMC5474348,PMC5474348_2
"In TBEV-infected mice, treatment with IFN-Î² or poly I:C diminishes demyelination and decreases the number of autoreactive CD4 T cells. Concomitant with these changes is an increase in IL-10 expression within the CNS, consistent with a change from a Th1 to Th2 response. However, studies of IL-10 in the context of TBEV are all correlative, and whether IL-10 actually has these postulated roles will require additional work.",PMC5474348,PMC5474348_3
"In the context of TBEV-infected mice, IL-10 produced largely by T cells is elevated in infected mice, and postulated to contribute to delayed virus clearance, much like tregs did, as described above. IL-10 expression remains elevated even when treg numbers",PMC5474348,PMC5474348_4
