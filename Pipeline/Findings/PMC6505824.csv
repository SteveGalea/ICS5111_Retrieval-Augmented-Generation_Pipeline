"The study involved commingling 50 head-intact dairy heifers and 50 replacement dairy heifers, 25 of each group, with 50 dairy heifers that served as controls, with the aim of evaluating the transmission of bovine viral diarrhoea (BVDV) in a commingling setting.",PMC6505824,PMC6505824_0
"After commingling, 45% (23 of 53) of the non-pi cattle demonstrated clinical signs of BVDV, including severe BVDV, and 1 animal required euthanasia due to severe BRD.",PMC6505824,PMC6505824_1
"The study identified the presence of a ""novel"" BVDV-1b strain in 8 non-pi cattle on the 3 sampling dates selected for 5'-UTR sequencing, which did not correspond to any of the strains from the pi cattle.",PMC6505824,PMC6505824_2
The study also found that the severity and duration of a BVDV infection were inversely proportional to the levels of BVDV neutralizing antibodies against BVDV at the onset of commingling with the pi cattle.,PMC6505824,PMC6505824_3
"The study found that the frequency of suspect BVDV RT-PCR results in nasal swab samples was higher than in either buffy coat or serum samples, and that suspect results on nasal swab samples did not indicate any pattern of either early or late stages of BVDV infection, as was identified in buffy coat or serum samples.",PMC6505824,PMC6505824_4
