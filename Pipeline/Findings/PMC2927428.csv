"The newly established bat cell line, r06e, can be productively infected with filoviruses, producing infectious viral particles with morphological signs similar to those seen in cells originating from monkeys or humans.",PMC2927428,PMC2927428_0
"R06e cells seem to be more effective in producing recombinant marv than other cell lines tested, allowing for the establishment of a na√Øve infectious vlp assay for marv.",PMC2927428,PMC2927428_1
"R06e cells support filovirus replication and release high titers of marv in the supernatant, with the exception of tissues that are less accessible to the immune response.",PMC2927428,PMC2927428_2
"The high expression levels of viral proteins and high viral titers found in the supernatants of r06e cells are consistent with the presumption that rousettus aegyptiacus is a reservoir for filoviruses, despite the fact that infected fruit bats develop a subclinical infection and neutralizing antibodies are raised in the serum of all animals.",PMC2927428,PMC2927428_3
"Further analysis of the innate immune response of r06e cells to filovirus infection is of great interest, as it may shed light on how filoviruses interfere with the host's immune system and potentially lead to persistent infections.",PMC2927428,PMC2927428_4
