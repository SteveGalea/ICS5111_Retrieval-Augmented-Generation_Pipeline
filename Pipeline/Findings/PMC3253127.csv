"Wild dogs with greater opportunities for contact with domestic dogs were at greater risk of exposure to canine parvovirus, ehrlichia, and neospora, but not for canine distemper virus or canine coronavirus.",PMC3253127,PMC3253127_0
"Exposure to canine parvovirus, ehrlichia, and neospora was associated with small pack size, rather than large pack size as would be expected if high intra-pack contact increased exposure.",PMC3253127,PMC3253127_1
"Exposure to coronavirus declined significantly over time, and similar patterns (albeit non-significant) were observed for all of the viral pathogens considered here.",PMC3253127,PMC3253127_2
"The balance between positive and negative effects of exposure to these pathogens is likely to vary between pathogens, suggesting that a single management strategy (e.g., domestic dog removal) might not be appropriate for all pathogens.",PMC3253127,PMC3253127_3
This study is one of a very small number of empirical attempts to quantify rates of contact between wild and domestic mammals and to successfully link individual variation in hosts' opportunities for interspecific contact to variation in pathogen exposure. Further studies of this kind are needed to address the growing number of wild species threatened by infectious disease.,PMC3253127,PMC3253127_4
