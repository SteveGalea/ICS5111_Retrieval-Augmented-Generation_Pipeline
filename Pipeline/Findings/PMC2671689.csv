The use of human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures provides an ideal environment for the propagation and detection of human respiratory viruses due to the lack of antibody reagents and minimal cytopathic effect.,PMC2671689,PMC2671689_0
"The whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) approach allows for the identification of elusive human respiratory viruses from supernatants of infected cultures, reducing the background of human cellular sequences.",PMC2671689,PMC2671689_1
"Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of human respiratory virus, hCoV-NL63, reveals its morphological features, including a 75–110 nm spherical envelope, 10–20 nm club-shaped spikes, and virion assembly by budding into smooth-walled vesicles, which are characteristic of classic human and non-human coronaviruses.",PMC2671689,PMC2671689_2
"WTA analysis of HCoV-NL63-inoculated HAE cultures revealed that 1.6% of clones were HCoV-NL63-positive, whereas Palacios et al. (2008) identified viral sequences in 0.01% randomly amplified cDNAs generated from a patient who succumbed to an unknown viral illness. These findings demonstrate the advantage of the ability to amplify and isolate viruses from supernatants, reducing the background of human cellular sequences.",PMC2671689,PMC2671689_3
