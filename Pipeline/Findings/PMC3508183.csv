"The study found no significant difference in susceptibility to infection with mpv, tmev, mhv, mnv, and pinworms between 4-, 12-, and aged (24- or 44-week-old) Swiss Webster sentinels exposed to a substantial dose of these infectious agents.",PMC3508183,PMC3508183_0
"The study found no significant difference in detection of mpv, tmev, mhv, mnv, and pinworms between contact and soiled-bedding sentinels in terms of age-associated susceptibility among all of the agents investigated in this study.",PMC3508183,PMC3508183_1
"The study found that natural infection with mpv, tmev, mhv, mnv, and helicobacter spp. Was not effectively transmitted to soiled-bedding sentinels, despite being transmitted to contact sentinels.",PMC3508183,PMC3508183_2
"The study found that helicobacter spp. Were not effectively transmitted to soiled-bedding sentinels, unlike most intestinal viruses in which shedding can be detected within days of infection.",PMC3508183,PMC3508183_3
"The study found that the minimal time necessary to detect seroconversion in soiled-bedding sentinels was 2 weeks for mav2, although the level of detection was low, as mav2 was detected in only a single sentinel by the end of 10 weeks.",PMC3508183,PMC3508183_4
