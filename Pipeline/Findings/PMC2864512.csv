"The use of ligand-conjugated liposomes, specifically those targeting tumor blood vessels, can significantly improve the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy by selectively delivering drugs to tumor tissues while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues.",PMC2864512,PMC2864512_0
"Peptide ligands, which are smaller, less immunogenic, and easier to produce and manipulate than antibodies, can improve tumor penetration and decrease clearance by macrophages, resulting in more effective drug delivery.",PMC2864512,PMC2864512_1
"Passive pegylated liposomes, while effective, can result in increased toxicity due to normal organ uptake and accumulation of the encapsulated drug in mononuclear phagocytic system cells in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.",PMC2864512,PMC2864512_2
"Phage display can be used to selectively bind peptide ligands to tumor-associated antigens and facilitate the delivery of drug-containing liposomes to intended cellular sites, resulting in more selective anticancer activity.",PMC2864512,PMC2864512_3
"The use of peptide-conjugated liposomes to target tumor blood vessels allows for the destruction of both tumor blood vessels and tumor cells, resulting in a greater, more durable anticancer effect than is found with simple antiangiogenic therapy.",PMC2864512,PMC2864512_4
