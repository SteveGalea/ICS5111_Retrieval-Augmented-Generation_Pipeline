"The study found that the first symptoms of newborns born to mothers with suspected or confirmed 2019-ncov infection in December 2019 were mainly respiratory distress (n=6), followed by gastrointestinal symptoms (n=4), fever (n=2), increased heart rate (n=1), and vomiting (n=1).",PMC7036645,PMC7036645_0
"The study found that vertical transmission of 2019-ncov mother-to-child transmission of respiratory viruses mainly occurs through close contact, transmission via droplets (among caregivers, family members, and family visitors), hospital-acquired infections, and exposure to sources of infection in public places. Vertical transmission refers to the passage of a pathogen from mother to baby during the period before and after birth.",PMC7036645,PMC7036645_1
"The study found that the 2019-ncov nat in their current study showed negative results in 9 of the 10 neonates and there was no evidence of 2019-ncov being vertically transmitted. However, the study also noted that if conditions allow, more specimens, including umbilical cord blood and amniotic fluid from the mother and serum, gastric fluid, anal swabs, or stools from the neonates, can be collected to optimize the detection rate of nat.",PMC7036645,PMC7036645_2
"The study found that the obstetrician should contact a neonatologist before delivery to prepare for resuscitation of the neonate in the delivery room, so as to improve the survival rate and prognosis of the newborn. If symptoms such as fever, coughing, and poor mental status are present, the patient should be admitted to an isolation room for observation and treatment, and specimens should be collected immediately and dynamically to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment.",PMC7036645,PMC7036645_3
"The study found that early intravenous injection of immunoglobulin may reduce severe illness and mortality in neonates born to mothers with suspected or confirmed 2019-ncov infection. Two of their neonates had thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function. One of them died, which might be due to poor awareness of the disease, poor immune function of the neonate, and quick disease progression; massive replication of virus in many tissues leads to",PMC7036645,PMC7036645_4
