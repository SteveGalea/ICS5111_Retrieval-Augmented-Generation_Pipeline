This study is the first report on the use of multiple intramuscular doses of cryopreserved allogeneic ascs to treat atopic dermatitis in dogs.,PMC6925044,PMC6925044_0
The protocol used for the administration of the cell product (a similar weekly dose of ascs for 6 weeks) was adequate to decrease skin lesions and itching in dogs with atopic dermatitis.,PMC6925044,PMC6925044_1
The low doses of stem cells used in this study reduce the risk of adverse effects induced by the intravenous administration of ascs and cryopreservation diminishes the cost of production and facilitates immediate use after the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.,PMC6925044,PMC6925044_2
"Unlike some studies in animals and humans that have suggested an inverse dose-response effect, this study shows that the protocol used for the administration of the cell product (a similar weekly dose of ascs for 6 weeks) was adequate to decrease skin lesions and itching in dogs with atopic dermatitis.",PMC6925044,PMC6925044_3
"The results of this clinical study show that the injection of allogeneic ascs is an effective treatment and a safe clinical approach for the relief of the symptoms of atopic dermatitis in dogs. However, the duration of the effects obtained with this dose should be compared with that of other doses, and the mechanism of action and possible long-term immunological reactions should be evaluated.",PMC6925044,PMC6925044_4
