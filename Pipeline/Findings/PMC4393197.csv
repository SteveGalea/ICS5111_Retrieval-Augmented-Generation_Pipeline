"The authors report a yield of approximately 2-7 x 10^5^ human aeii cells per gram of peripheral lung tissue, with a high purity achieved by combining trypsin and elastase digestion for tissue harvest and separation of macrophages and fibroblasts using an adhesion medium antibody for negative selection at an optimized time.",PMC4393197,PMC4393197_0
"The authors demonstrate that primary human aeii cells can be maintained in culture for over 20 days with the use of SAGM containing 1% fetal bovine serum, which allows for common mechanistic studies in vitro following insults such as mechanical stretch, hypoxic exposure, and acid challenge.",PMC4393197,PMC4393197_1
"The authors characterize the primary human aeii cells by the expression of pro-SP-C, cytokeratin-8, αENAC, and lamellar bodies, as well as sustained expression of surfactant proteins, epithelial markers, and aeii cell differentiation marker of AQP-3, while lacking AQP-5 of an aei cell marker.",PMC4393197,PMC4393197_2
"The authors show that primary human aeii cells exhibit excellent biological function by upregulation of cytokines, chemokine, and adhesion molecule at gene and protein levels in response to stimulation with TNF-α, providing an important tool to study inflammatory responses involved in aeii cells.",PMC4393197,PMC4393197_3
"The authors highlight the importance of using the normal peripheral lung tissue from patients undergoing lung resection as a tissue source and optimizing the components of culture medium, as the rapid loss of cell function and cell differentiation into ati phenotype within a few days have been major concerns in previous studies.",PMC4393197,PMC4393197_4
