"A dromedary camel vaccine against mers-cov has been developed and tested in camels and alpaca, with complete protection from viral shedding observed in both species following vaccination.",PMC6466352,PMC6466352_0
"Vaccination in camels resulted in reduced but not complete absence of virus shedding, with virus replication largely confined to the nasal turbinates.",PMC6466352,PMC6466352_1
"Variable neutralizing responses after mers-cov vaccination have been observed in camels, with one animal in a group of three failing to respond to vaccination at all.",PMC6466352,PMC6466352_2
"The response to vaccination in camels varies widely, with one animal in a group of three failing to mount a detectable neutralizing response after vaccination with a DNA vaccine expressing full-length spike protein.",PMC6466352,PMC6466352_3
"Vaccine development efforts should focus on vaccine platforms that uniformly induce immunity in camels, and in-depth studies to determine the correlates of protection in camels would aid the development of better-targeted vaccines, especially the correlation of levels of neutralizing antibodies in the serum vs. Protection against mers-cov in the upper respiratory tract.",PMC6466352,PMC6466352_4
