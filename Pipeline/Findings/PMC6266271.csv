"A new model for studying cystic fibrosis (CF) in mice has been developed by introducing a mutated CFTR gene. This model, known as the CF mouse, has been shown to recapitulate many of the same lung disease symptoms seen in humans with CF.",PMC6266271,PMC6266271_0
Studies have shown that the efficiency of introducing double stranded breaks with different guide RNAs and the efficiency of homologous recombination with different repair templates will need to be assessed for each CFTR mutation in gene editing therapy.,PMC6266271,PMC6266271_1
"Gene editing tools, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), talens, meganucleases, and CRISPR/Cas9, are being used to develop gene therapy treatments for inherited retinal diseases like retinitis pigmentosa and Leber's congenital amaurosis.",PMC6266271,PMC6266271_2
Nanoparticle delivery chemistries with enhanced tropism are emerging as a new development in CF gene therapy.,PMC6266271,PMC6266271_3
"The field of CF gene therapy is learning valuable lessons from the many viral and nonviral clinical trials to date, and is developing new vectors that can efficiently and persistently correct the CFTR anion channel defect. New animal models that recapitulate features of human lung disease are also being used in preclinical studies to refine delivery protocols and measure novel metrics of phenotypic correction.",PMC6266271,PMC6266271_4
