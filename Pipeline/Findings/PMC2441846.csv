"IFN-alfacon 1 inhibited SARS-CoV replication in a dose-dependent manner in various cell lines, including Vero 76, Vero E6, MA104, and Calu-3 cells.",PMC2441846,PMC2441846_0
"IFN-alfacon 1 showed sporadic activity against SARS-CoV in Vero 76 cells, likely due to variability in cell condition and age.",PMC2441846,PMC2441846_1
"IFN-alfacon 1 reduced SARS-CoV yields by 90% in Vero E6, MA104, and Calu-3 cells, providing a complete protection at higher doses and a linear dose response at lower doses.",PMC2441846,PMC2441846_2
IFN-alfacon 1 was shown to be more active against SARS-CoV when tested in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells than in African Green Monkey Epithelial cells.,PMC2441846,PMC2441846_3
"IFN-alfacon 1 demonstrated significant antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells, as shown by both neutral red uptake assay and virus yield reduction assay, providing useful insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and potentially therapeutically advantageous properties.",PMC2441846,PMC2441846_4
