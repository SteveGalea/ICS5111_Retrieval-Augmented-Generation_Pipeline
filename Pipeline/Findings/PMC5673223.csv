"The present study demonstrated that oral administration of Lactococcus lactis displaying the influenza virus ha1 antigen elicited significant mucosal immune response, specifically secretory IgA (sIgA), in mice, providing protection against a lethal challenge with the homologous influenza virus.",PMC5673223,PMC5673223_0
The study found that the level of sIgA response elicited by L. lactis displaying ha1 antigen could be improved in a dose-dependent manner.,PMC5673223,PMC5673223_1
"Mice orally immunized with L. lactis displaying ha1 antigen showed markedly improved immune response, including less sickness and body weight loss upon lethal challenge with influenza virus, compared to mice immunized with ha1 antigen alone.",PMC5673223,PMC5673223_2
"The study highlights the importance of mucosal immunity, particularly in the respiratory tract, in providing protection against influenza virus challenge.",PMC5673223,PMC5673223_3
"The study suggests that L. lactis could be a potential platform for vaccine delivery due to its ability to elicit significant mucosal immune response, particularly sIgA, and provide protection against influenza virus challenge.",PMC5673223,PMC5673223_4
