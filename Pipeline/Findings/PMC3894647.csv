"In a study comparing the circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone in male sprague–dawley rats housed in red-, blue-, or clear cages, the peak amplitude in the red group was significantly lower than that in the clear group, but all groups exhibited a long-duration square wave elevation in corticosterone levels that revealed a peak at the end of the light phase.",PMC3894647,PMC3894647_0
"In another study examining the rhythm of plasma leptin in male sprague–dawley rats housed in blue- or clear-caged groups, the peak melatonin levels in the blue group were higher than those in the clear group, but the leptin peak was significantly lower.",PMC3894647,PMC3894647_1
"A study investigating the circadian rhythm of plasma total fatty acids in male sprague–dawley rats housed in red-, blue-, or clear cages found that the peak amplitude in the red group was delayed by 8 hours, and the peak lactate levels in the red group were lower than those in the clear group, whereas the leptin peak was significantly higher.",PMC3894647,PMC3894647_2
"In a study examining the circadian rhythm of plasma insulin in male sprague–dawley rats housed in red-, blue-, or clear cages, the peak insulin levels in the red group were lower than those in the clear group, but the leptin peak was significantly higher.",PMC3894647,PMC3894647_3
