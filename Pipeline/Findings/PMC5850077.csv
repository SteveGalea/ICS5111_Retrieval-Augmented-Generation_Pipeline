"Culture-based diagnostic tests for severe pneumonia are neither sensitive nor fast enough to guide precise and timely treatment, leading to empirical, suboptimal care for individual patients.",PMC5850077,PMC5850077_0
The root cause of diagnostic limitations is our reliance on culture-based diagnostic tests that are neither sensitive nor fast enough to guide precise and timely treatment for individual patients.,PMC5850077,PMC5850077_1
"The ability to efficiently and precisely target antibiotics is an unmet critical need in the care of severe pneumonia in the ICU, as even small delays translate into measurable increases in mortality.",PMC5850077,PMC5850077_2
"Shotgun approaches, such as whole metacommunity shotgun sequencing of DNA (metagenomics) or RNA (metatranscriptomics), offer an unprecedented opportunity for ""hypothesis-free"" diagnostics, as they capture the wide microorganismal breadth and coding potential of pathogens with metagenomics and the functional activity of communities with metatranscriptomics.",PMC5850077,PMC5850077_3
"Metagenomics-based diagnostic tests have to reach standard thresholds of scientific evidence rigor to be recommended for use, as demonstration of clinical efficacy for improving patient outcomes is the ultimate determinant for clinical adoption of any diagnostic test, regardless of its sophistication.",PMC5850077,PMC5850077_4
