"A significant number of individuals, including healthy blood donors, test indeterminate for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) in Western blot (WB) assays, with some individuals exhibiting antibody responses to HTLV-I but not to the tax region.",PMC3185804,PMC3185804_0
"These seroindeterminate banding patterns may be related to a low copy number of prototype HTLV-I, as some individuals with seroindeterminate banding patterns have been found to have HTLV-I proviral sequences that are globally >97% homologous to prototype HTLV-I on the nucleotide level.",PMC3185804,PMC3185804_1
"These seroindeterminate banding patterns may represent exposure to HTLV-I, as reports of PCR amplification of prototype HTLV-I sequences from HTLV-I seroindeterminate individuals, especially in endemic regions, suggest a potentially far greater exposure to HTLV-I at least in some sub-populations of HTLV-I seroindeterminates.",PMC3185804,PMC3185804_2
"These findings may have important implications, as exposure to HTLV-I, a virus associated with neurodegenerative diseases and other illnesses, may pose a possible risk to those transfused with HTLV-I seroindeterminate blood, although the clinical consequence of obtaining blood from an HTLV-I seroindeterminate donor is not known.",PMC3185804,PMC3185804_3
