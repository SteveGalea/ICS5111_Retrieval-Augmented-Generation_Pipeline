"Inflammatory monocytes in the liver and spleen can be targeted using highly negatively charged nanoparticles (NPs) to induce tolerance in autoimmune diseases. These NPs, known as tolerogenic immune modifying nanoparticles (timps), are loaded with antigens and deliver them to marco+ macrophages, resulting in the production of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor, which have regulatory functions in autoimmune diseases. Timps also promote the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the long-term survival of skin grafts in rodent transplant recipients.",PMC4603374,PMC4603374_0
"Inflammatory monocytes in the liver and spleen can be targeted using highly negatively charged NPs to induce tolerance in autoimmune diseases through the production of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor, which have regulatory functions in autoimmune diseases. This mechanism has been successfully applied in numerous th1-, th17-, and even th2-mediated rodent disease models, including celiac disease, gene therapy tolerance, and hemophilia A factor V peptides.",PMC4603374,PMC4603374_1
"Inflammatory monocytes in the liver and spleen can be targeted using highly negatively charged NPs to induce tolerance in autoimmune diseases through the production of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor, which have regulatory functions in autoimmune diseases. This mechanism has been shown to be effective in models of allergic airway, food allergy, and xenogeneic islet graft tolerance.",PMC4603374,PMC4603374_2
"Inflammatory monocytes in the liver and spleen can be targeted using highly negatively charged NPs to induce tolerance in autoimmune diseases through the production of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor, which have regulatory functions in autoimmune diseases. This mechanism has been shown to be effective in models of multiple sclerosis, myocardial infarction, and acute encephalitis syndrome.",PMC4603374,PMC4603374_3
