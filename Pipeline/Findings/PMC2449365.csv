"The crystal structures of the hemagglutinin esterase (HE) enzyme from bovine coronavirus (BCoV) in complex with its natural substrate, neuraminic acid (Neu) oligosaccharide, and with a synthetic substrate analog, 4-O-acetyl-9-O-acetyl-Neu3,2, have been determined. This allows for the first time to compare the enzymatic mechanisms between these two substrates.",PMC2449365,PMC2449365_0
"The HE enzyme from BCoV strain MeBs has been shown to have a high affinity for the 9-O-acetylated Neu3,2 substrate, which is a characteristic feature of the HE enzyme from the highly virulent BCoV strain 6/1. This suggests that the HE enzyme from MeBs may also contribute to virulence in BCoV.",PMC2449365,PMC2449365_1
The HE enzyme from MeBs has been found to have a different receptor-binding site compared to the HE enzyme from the less virulent BCoV strain NCD6/1. This suggests that the HE enzyme may have a different role in virulence between these two strains.,PMC2449365,PMC2449365_2
"The crystal structures of the HE enzyme from MeBs in complex with the synthetic substrate analog, 4-O-acetyl-9-O-acetyl-Neu3,2, have allowed for the first time to determine the structure of the enzyme in complex with a synthetic substrate analog.",PMC2449365,PMC2449365_3
"The crystal structures of the HE enzyme from MeBs in complex with the synthetic substrate analog have also provided insight into the enzymatic mechanism of HE in complex with the natural substrate, Neu3,2. This may aid in the development of inhibitors targeting the HE enzyme from BCoV.",PMC2449365,PMC2449365_4
