"The EMBL-EBI resource, ELM, provides a manually curated data set of linear motif classes with experimentally validated slim instances. This resource is valuable to the research community due to the importance and abundance of short linear motifs in various contexts.",PMC3245074,PMC3245074_0
Short linear motifs are important in understanding diseases and viruses because mutations in these motifs or creation of novel motifs can cause diseases or be used by viruses to counteract the host's defense mechanisms.,PMC3245074,PMC3245074_1
"Short linear motifs are important in protein interactions because they mediate protein-protein interactions, often in a context-specific manner.",PMC3245074,PMC3245074_2
Short linear motifs are important in protein localization because they can determine the subcellular localization of a protein.,PMC3245074,PMC3245074_3
Short linear motifs are important in post-translational modifications because they can mediate the recognition of substrates for various post-translational modifications.,PMC3245074,PMC3245074_4
