"The study by tang and colleagues (tang et al., 2020) estimated a reproduction number of 6.47 (95% ci 5.71–7.23), with a peak value of infected individuals occurring around february 4th, 2020, and a peak time around february 15th, 2020. This value is higher than those computed by other studies (e.g., zhao and colleagues (zhao et al., 2020) and yu and althaus (riou & althaus, 2020)) and reflects the highly dynamic transmission risk of the coronavirus outbreak, particularly in the epicenter of wuhan and the surrounding areas in hubei province and throughout China.",PMC7029158,PMC7029158_0
"The study by wu and colleagues (wu et al., 2020) estimated a reproduction number ranging from 2.0 to 3.1, depending on the assumptions and choice of parameters utilized in their model. This value is similar to those computed by other studies (e.g., liu and colleagues (liu et al., 2020), majumder and mandl (majumder & mandl, 2020), and kucharski and colleagues (kucharski et al., 2020)) and reflects the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the dynamics of case reporting.",PMC7029158,PMC7029158_1
"The study by riou and althaus (riou & althaus, 2020) estimated a reproduction number of 2.2 (95% ci 2.28–3.67), which is similar to the values computed by other studies (e.g., liu and colleagues (liu et al., 2020) and liu and coworkers (liu et al., 2020)) and reflects the highly dynamic transmission risk of the coronavirus outbreak, particularly in the epicenter of wuhan and the surrounding areas in hubei province and throughout China.",PMC7029158,PMC7029158_2
"The study by kucharski and colleagues (kucharski et al., 2020) estimated a reproduction number of 2.90 (95% ci 2.32–3.",PMC7029158,PMC7029158_3
