"The EOPM array can detect almost all known viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites due to its high-density probe design, which allows for the statistical enrichment analysis of probe groups.",PMC3848773,PMC3848773_0
"The EOPM method has been successfully applied in several clinical test applications, as it can detect pathogens causing evident clinical symptoms, and it is sufficiently sensitive to identify the pathogens causing symptoms in infectious outbreaks.",PMC3848773,PMC3848773_1
"The EOPM method can distinguish between bacteria, fungi, and parasites at either the genus or family level due to its random amplification approach, as it detects either rRNA molecules or dna viruses, including the reverse-transcribed cdna.",PMC3848773,PMC3848773_2
The EOPM method can effectively narrow down the potential pathogens and even identify novel pathogens in complex clinical infection situations due to the statistical enrichment analysis of probe groups.,PMC3848773,PMC3848773_3
"The EOPM method is more suitable for applications requiring detection of unknown pathogens during infectious outbreaks due to its user-friendly interface, facilitating its application in molecular laboratories, and its rapid pathogen screening results, which can be interpreted in less than 28 hours.",PMC3848773,PMC3848773_4
"The EOPM method is designed for easy operation, with detection software containing a user-friendly interface, facilitating its application in molecular laboratories, and its software copyright is pending related to pathogen interpretation.",PMC3848773,PMC3848773_5
"The EOPM method can effectively narrow down the potential pathogens and even identify novel pathogens in complex clinical infection situations due to the statistical enrichment analysis of probe groups, as over a dozen long oligonucleotide probes are designed for each pathogen, allowing for reliable identification of a pathogen based on a statistical enrichment analysis of the probe group.",PMC3848773,PMC3848773_6
