This study generated multivirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) using a single culture of peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) in the presence of growth-promoting cytokines.,PMC3412490,PMC3412490_0
"The study used commercially available pepmixes and alphavirus-derived dendritic cells, which were matured with a cytokine maturation cocktail containing interleukin-16 (IL-16).",PMC3412490,PMC3412490_1
