The study found that feline calicivirus (FCV) was isolated more frequently than feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) in cats with or without clinical signs in southern Brazil. This finding is similar to that reported in studies conducted in European countries and the United Kingdom.,PMC3768834,PMC3768834_0
"The study revealed that FHV-1 was isolated more frequently from vaccinated cats, particularly those from breeding catters experiencing an outbreak of respiratory disease. This suggests that vaccination may have contributed to a reduction in the number of cats excreting FHV-1 but did not significantly affect the number of cats excreting FCV.",PMC3768834,PMC3768834_1
"The study also found that FCV was isolated more frequently from adult cats, whereas FHV-1 was primarily isolated from younger animals. This finding is consistent with previous studies conducted in cat populations from various locations.",PMC3768834,PMC3768834_2
"The study demonstrated that both FCV and FHV-1 were more frequently isolated from cats that shared a living space, highlighting the importance of close contact between infected and susceptible animals in the transmission of these viruses.",PMC3768834,PMC3768834_3
"The study also identified cats without clinical signs that were excreting FCV and FHV-1, including those that had previously been vaccinated against these viruses. This finding emphasizes the need for continued research into these important diseases of domesticated cats, as these animals could potentially serve as a source of infection, particularly for kittens.",PMC3768834,PMC3768834_4
