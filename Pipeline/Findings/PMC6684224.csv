"Social contact surveys have been conducted widely in many countries, but most focused on high-income countries. These surveys used a range of different study designs with different study subjects, settings, sampling scheme to study designs, data collection tools, and data collection methods.",PMC6684224,PMC6684224_0
"Major determinants for this number of contactees reported per day include characteristics of the respondent (age, sex, and health status), time (weekday or weekend, and term time or vacation), and their immediate environment (household size and urban vs. rural). A typical number of different contactees reported per day is in the order of 20 for countrywide studies, which proved remarkably robust despite the many different study designs.",PMC6684224,PMC6684224_1
"From the results of this review, we formulate the following recommendations for future surveys collecting social contact data relevant for the spread of respiratory pathogens. (1) Study object: There is the need to continue the collection of social contact data, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Still, in high-income countries, social contact surveys can detail interactions in epidemiologically relevant groups. (2) Random sample: Depending on the study objectives, participants should be selected as randomly as possible, so findings can be properly extrapolated to encompass target population. (3) Sampling: The sampling procedure should be described in detail, including response rates and information about at which stage and how participants can be excluded from the final sample, together with all the demographic factors considered when identifying the sample size. (4) Method: Prospective design should be preferred to retrospective design, since it allows respondents to remember more contact features. (5) Contact definition: At least two contact types should be included, one aimed to measure more casual contact and one aimed to measure physical contact. (6) Behavioral change: Possible indicators of behavioral changes (feeling ill) should be included as well, given their large impact on disease spread. (7) Sharing data: Finally, we want to bring to attention that several datasets referred to in this review are available in a unified format (www.socialcontactata.org73) that is compatible with an R package for social contact analysis (socialMixR76). Complying with this standard format will improve the dissemination of future surveysâ€™ data and increase their value for the scientific community.",PMC6684224,PMC6684224_2
