"The study confirms that deletion of the entire mhv 5′utr is lethal for virus replication and reveals that the genome carrying this deletion is defective in directing subgenomic rna synthesis. This suggests that the mhv 5′utr, including the cis-acting stem-loop structures sl1, sl2, and sl4, plays a critical role in subgenomic rna synthesis during mhv replication.",PMC3165806,PMC3165806_0
"The study demonstrates that sl4, as one of the cis-acting elements in the mhv 5′utr, functions as a structural spacer element that properly orients sl1, sl2, trs, and/or more distal structural elements of the 5′utr. This structural spacer function is relatively less important for virus replication than the spacing between sl4 and other 5′utr stem-loops.",PMC3165806,PMC3165806_1
"The study shows that deletion of 131aca133 has a profound impact on virus replication and viruses carrying this deletion are heterogeneous in phenotype (plaque size) and are not genetically stable, with isolation of second-site revertants in a number of places in the 5′utr, which compensates the decreased plaque sizes, delayed growth kinetics, and lower peak titer associated with 131aca133 deletion. This suggests that there is an optimal spacing between sl4 and sl1 and/or sl2.",PMC3165806,PMC3165806_2
"The study suggests that the distance between sl4 and sl1 and/or sl2 is important for virus replication, as viruses with more than two ucuaa repeats in the wild-type mhv-a59 evolve the number of repeats downward with serial passage (26). This is consistent with the idea that there is an optimal spacing between sl4 and sl1 and/or sl2.",PMC3165806,PMC3165806_3
"The study shows that the mhv genome can tolerate the deletion of either sl4a or sl4b and yield viable viruses. Replacing sl4 with a sequence-unrelated shorter stem-loop structure (sl4-r) permits recovery of infectious recombinant virus, providing a further indication that the sequence of sl4 is relatively less",PMC3165806,PMC3165806_4
