A stable cell population expressing human npc1 wt was generated in cho-k1 cells.,PMC3402687,PMC3402687_0
Resistant cho-k1 cells were challenged with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pseudotypes bearing vsv g and containing a plenti cmv npc1 hygro vector.,PMC3402687,PMC3402687_1
"Overexpression assays for catl, catb, axl, and tim-1 wt and resistant cho-k1 cells were performed in 6-well plates.",PMC3402687,PMC3402687_2
A pseudoviral preparation to make HIV pseudotypes was made using a standard calcium phosphate method.,PMC3402687,PMC3402687_3
The percent of input virus that bound to cells was determined by comparing p24 levels from lysates to the p24 level in a lane containing the same amount of virus as was initially added to each well of cells.,PMC3402687,PMC3402687_4
