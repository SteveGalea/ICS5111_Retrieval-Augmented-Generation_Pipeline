"In the context of modeling influenza-like illnesses, the authors propose a Bayesian approach that uses a set of medical findings to model the probability of the presence of an unmodeled disease in a population. This approach, called DUDE (Detector Using Data-driven Evolution), identifies sets of cases with rates of symptoms that are statistically different from a baseline of earlier cases. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DUDE by measuring its performance when detecting known diseases, while pretending to know nothing about them, and also by showing that it can retroactively identify an outbreak of a new disease in a timely fashion.",PMC7048291,PMC7048291_0
"In the context of detecting an outbreak of an unmodeled disease, the authors note that cases of unmodeled diseases are often uncommon, at least initially, due to the fact that only a fraction of patients are comprehensively tested. They suggest that a better approach would be to probabilistically model each of the known diseases and compute the expected number of each disease in the entire dataset. This would allow for the computation of the expected number of each finding, assuming no unmodeled disease is present, and the likelihood of an unmodeled disease based on how the actual distributions of findings differ from what would be expected if no unmodeled disease is present.",PMC7048291,PMC7048291_1
"In the context of improving the performance of DUDE, the authors note that because DUDE is built to identify new, unmodeled diseases, it only considers records of patients who have definitively tested negative for all modeled diseases. However, since only a fraction of patients are comprehensively tested, this has the effect of ignoring much of the incoming data. They suggest that a better approach would be to probabilistically model each of the known diseases and use this to compute the expected number of each finding, assuming no unmodeled disease is present.",PMC7048291,PMC7048291_2
"In the context of improving the performance of DUDE, the authors also note that because DUDE is built to identify new, unmodeled diseases, it generates false alarms, which are inevitable due to the tradeoff between timeliness and false alarms. They suggest that in times of heightened alertness, it may be prudent to lower the alarm threshold and examine the cases that generate alarms.",PMC7048291,PMC7048291_3
"In the context of improving the performance of DUDE, the authors suggest that to be more effective, DUDE should generate an alarm",PMC7048291,PMC7048291_4
