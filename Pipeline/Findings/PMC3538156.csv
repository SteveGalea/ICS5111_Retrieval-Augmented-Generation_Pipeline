"The study identified a virus in 59.3% of the participants, with rsv being the most common virus among lrti patients using rt-rt-pcr, dfa, and svc.",PMC3538156,PMC3538156_0
"The study demonstrated that hadv, detected in 18.5%, is the second most common causative viral agent for lrti.",PMC3538156,PMC3538156_1
"The study confirmed that rsv is successfully isolated using the r-mixâ„¢ system, which has a low sensitivity for hadv detection compared to rt-rt-pcr.",PMC3538156,PMC3538156_2
"The study showed that hadv, rsv, and hpiv-1 were the most commonly detected viruses in this study, which is consistent with results using other studies worldwide.",PMC3538156,PMC3538156_3
"The study revealed that virus isolation-based methods such as svc and dfa have lower sensitivity for virus detection compared to rt-rt-pcr, particularly after the first three days post-onset of symptoms, when viral titers decrease over the course of infection.",PMC3538156,PMC3538156_4
