"The model predicts that reducing the duration of exposure to amplifiers has little impact on overall population-wide tb incidence, but primary risk reduction strategies, such as limiting the proportion of the population at risk of entering amplifiers, have more beneficial effects.",PMC3005502,PMC3005502_0
"The model predicts that the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in amplifier communities is substantially higher than in the general population, and that HIV and institutional amplifiers can synergistically increase population-wide tb incidence.",PMC3005502,PMC3005502_1
"The model predicts that reducing the number of persons entering amplifiers is a key intervention to limit population-wide tb incidence, prevalence, and mortality, and policies designed to achieve international goals for tb control require explicit consideration of the features of high-prevalence communities affected by such amplifiers.",PMC3005502,PMC3005502_2
"The model predicts that increasing case detection and treatment success rates among those already exposed to amplifiers has limited impact on overall population-wide tb incidence, and that reducing the number of persons entering amplifiers is more effective than conventional tb control strategies.",PMC3005502,PMC3005502_3
"The model predicts that the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tb in amplifier communities is substantially higher than in the general population, and that hiv and institutional amplifiers can synergistically increase population-wide tb incidence.",PMC3005502,PMC3005502_4
