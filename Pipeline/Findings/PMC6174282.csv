"The study found that diagnostic testing for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was concordant with international guidelines in only a small proportion of patients. Over-testing and under-testing were common issues, with the latter more frequently encountered in North America than in Europe.",PMC6174282,PMC6174282_0
"The study revealed a significant geographic variation in diagnostic testing strategies, with blood cultures and viral testing being underutilized in Africa. This could be attributed to the limited laboratory infrastructure and the seasonality and epidemiological relevance of respiratory viruses in the region.",PMC6174282,PMC6174282_1
"The study highlighted the low sensitivity of blood cultures for revealing the aetiology of CAP, with only 6.7% of blood cultures yielding a positive result. Bal cultures, on the other hand, showed a high diagnostic yield of 38.8%.",PMC6174282,PMC6174282_2
The study found that the discordance between real-life diagnostic testing and international guidelines was mainly due to over-testing. This could be explained by the restrictive testing recommended by the international guidelines.,PMC6174282,PMC6174282_3
"The study suggested that the extensive ordering of diagnostic tests, even beyond what is recommended by the European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines, by European and North American clinicians, warrants further investigation, as the significant discrepancies between real-life diagnostic testing and international guidelines recommendations could have important clinical and economic implications.",PMC6174282,PMC6174282_4
