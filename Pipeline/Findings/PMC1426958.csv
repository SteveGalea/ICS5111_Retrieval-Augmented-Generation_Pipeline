Longer (≥30 bases) ps-ons are more potent hiv-1 entry and fusion inhibitors than shorter (<30 bases) ps-ons due to their increased hydrophobic character.,PMC1426958,PMC1426958_0
The interaction of ps-ons with the hydrophobic regions of gp41 is not dependent on their polyanionic nature but rather on their increased hydrophobic character.,PMC1426958,PMC1426958_1
"Ps-ons inhibit both hiv-1 attachment and hiv-1-mediated membrane fusion by interacting with multiple target sites along the gp41 amphipathic α-helices, rather than a specific active site that is sensitive to point mutation.",PMC1426958,PMC1426958_2
"The interaction of ps-ons with the α-helices of gp41, the prototypical type i viral fusion protein, has important implications for the potential broad-spectrum antiviral activities of longer ps-ons due to the conservation of these domains in viruses from several different viral families.",PMC1426958,PMC1426958_3
"The mechanism of action described herein shows the potential of α-helix bundle formation as a target for therapeutic activity due to the unaltered activity of longer ps-ons against several t-20-resistant strains and also by the fact that ps-ons have potent in vivo activity against viruses with type i fusion proteins in the families of herpesviridae, orthomyxoviridae, paramyxoviridae, and filoviridae.",PMC1426958,PMC1426958_4
