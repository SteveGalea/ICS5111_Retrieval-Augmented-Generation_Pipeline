"The study developed generic, rapid, and economical assays for canine parvovirus (CPV) antigen and antibody measurements using the intrinsic property of CPV-2 to agglutinate porcine erythrocytes.",PMC2620666,PMC2620666_0
"The study found that CPV-2b and CPV-2c isolates could be distinguished based on their ability to inhibit the agglutination of porcine erythrocytes by hyperimmune anti-CPV-2b serum, with a higher sensitivity for homologous CPV-2b isolates.",PMC2620666,PMC2620666_1
"The study found that a single CPV isolate (CPV-2b) was not inhibited by a standard hyperimmune anti-CPV-2b serum, indicating the presence of antigenically different CPV variants.",PMC2620666,PMC2620666_2
The study highlighted the need for pan-CPV tests that can detect all genotypes and antigenic variants of CPV for field use due to the rapid evolution of CPV.,PMC2620666,PMC2620666_3
"The study found that the sat-sit assay, which uses the intrinsic property of CPV-2 to agglutinate porcine erythrocytes and modified it to develop rapid and easy formats of CPV antigen and antibody monitoring, could be a very cost-effective alternative to field technologies, such as lateral flow immunoassays, for CPV monitoring in developing countries.",PMC2620666,PMC2620666_4
