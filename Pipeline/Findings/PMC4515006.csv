"Infected calves with acute respiratory disease due to Chlamydia psittaci showed a significant increase in LBP and a decrease in albumin in blood, verifying a systemic acute phase response.",PMC4515006,PMC4515006_0
"In infected animals, absolute concentrations of LBP and Haptoglobin (HP) in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) correlated significantly with the respiratory score.",PMC4515006,PMC4515006_1
"The quotient [LBP]/[BSA] in BALF peaked significantly in acutely infected animals and decreased during the recovery phase, being significantly higher compared to healthy controls.",PMC4515006,PMC4515006_2
"HP and Lactoferrin (LF) in BALF, as well as [HP]/[BSA] and [LF]/[BSA] quotients, decreased during the study in infected animals but were never higher than in healthy controls.",PMC4515006,PMC4515006_3
Concentrations of CRP and [CRP]/[BSA] quotient did not show significant differences between infected and healthy animals or during the course of infection.,PMC4515006,PMC4515006_4
