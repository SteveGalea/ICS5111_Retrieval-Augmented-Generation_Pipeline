A study found that inserting a peptide sequence corresponding to the main neutralizing epitope of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) into the hypervariable regions (HVRs) of human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) hexon protein resulted in the production of recombinant Ad5 viruses.,PMC4460227,PMC4460227_0
"The peptide sequence was inserted into the HVRs of the hexon protein in three different locations (HVR7, HVR8, and HVR9) using synthetic oligonucleotides.",PMC4460227,PMC4460227_1
"The study found that the virus containing the peptide sequence in the HVR7 location showed a significant reduction in viral particle production, while the viruses containing the peptide sequence in the HVR8 or HVR9 locations showed a significant increase in viral particle production compared to the wild-type virus.",PMC4460227,PMC4460227_2
"The study also found that the virus containing the peptide sequence in the HVR8 location showed a significant reduction in cytopathic effect (CPE) compared to the wild-type virus, while the virus containing the peptide sequence in the HVR9 location showed a significant increase in CPE.",PMC4460227,PMC4460227_3
The study developed a method to test if the peptide incorporated into the hexon protein is accessible to anti-peptide antibody at the virion level using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The study found that the ELISA could detect the peptide sequence in the viral particles at concentrations ranging from 10^5^ to 10^10^ viral particles.,PMC4460227,PMC4460227_4
