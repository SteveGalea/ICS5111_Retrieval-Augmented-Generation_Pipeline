"The study detected 146 (12.4% of tested specimens) hcovs occurring in both cases and controls, with higher detection rates of hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 among cases compared to controls.",PMC4117488,PMC4117488_0
"The study identified hcov-nl63 at almost equal rates in cases and controls, which could possibly suggest the virus may have an insignificant role in causing upper respiratory tract infection among adults and older children.",PMC4117488,PMC4117488_1
"The study recorded high detection rates of hcovs in the harmattan and wet seasons compared to the other seasons, possibly related to seasonal variations in host immune status to infection and changes in humidity.",PMC4117488,PMC4117488_2
The study did not find differences in the strains from their study compared to reference strains from the GenBank.,PMC4117488,PMC4117488_3
"The study detected high proportions of hcov-229e in the high social contact group compared to the low social contact group, possibly suggesting the virus may have a role in causing upper respiratory tract infection among adults and older children in social settings.",PMC4117488,PMC4117488_4
