"The current pedv strains isolated in China have significant genetic variation from both the vaccine strains and previous strains, suggesting a possible explanation for the nationwide outbreak and the poor efficacy of commercial vaccines.",PMC3919097,PMC3919097_0
"The current pedv strains have a high homology in their partial s, full orf3, and m genes, despite being clustered into different subgroups based on these genes.",PMC3919097,PMC3919097_1
"The current pedv strains have a significant hydrophobic alternation in the s glycoprotein, induced by a 4–9 aa mutations in the neutralizing epitope region, which could provide one explanation for the poor immunity.",PMC3919097,PMC3919097_2
"The current pedv strains have a different hydrophobicity in their m protein compared to the attenuated pedv dr13 and vaccine strain cv777, which might be due to their adaptability and viral replication.",PMC3919097,PMC3919097_3
"The current pedv strains have a mutation at aa 13 (e → q) in the m protein, which would have affected the hydrophobicity of the m protein, but the function of this mutation requires further investigation.",PMC3919097,PMC3919097_4
