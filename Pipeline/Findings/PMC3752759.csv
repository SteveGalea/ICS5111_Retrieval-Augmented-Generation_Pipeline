This investigation led to the conclusion that we were dealing with a cluster of primary pneumonic plague (PPP) cases.,PMC3752759,PMC3752759_0
"The clinical illnesses including rapid incubation, fulminant progression, bloody sputum, progressive segmental consolidation, cavitation (in one case), and hypotension are all typical of PPP.",PMC3752759,PMC3752759_1
"Although initial negative f1 antibody tests for plague were misleading as to cause of the illnesses, tests for f1 antibody are often negative in patients who are treated with effective antibiotics, if sera are taken within 2 weeks of onset, as were done in these cases.",PMC3752759,PMC3752759_2
"The epidemiologic pattern also exhibited features of PPP. Other infectious agents that cause pneumonia will result in a substantial proportion of asymptomatic or mild infections relative to each case of severe pneumonia. For these other agents, with the possible exception of SARS, one would rarely expect more than one case of secondary pneumonia in a small group.",PMC3752759,PMC3752759_3
"Under the conditions of close exposure in an enclosed space, PPP is among a very small number of organisms that can yield high secondary attack rates of severe pneumonias. In this cluster, person-to-person transmission of PPP caused infection of three persons and probably a fourth (the mother) within the confines of a truck cab. Despite many more person-hours of contact, family members of secondary cases were not infected nor were medical staff who attended all the patients without any special protective measures.",PMC3752759,PMC3752759_4
