"The Pathways service at MGH is a new clinical rotation focused on clinical investigation inspired by former MGH residents who died in an avalanche. It aims to enable exploration of a single patient with a rare and difficult-to-diagnose disease, generate new insights into disease mechanisms, and reconnect biology to the bedside through molecular biology platforms.",PMC6093444,PMC6093444_0
"The Pathways service has generated and tested hypotheses about potential unifying mechanisms from unexplained patients, resulting in clinical interventions, diagnostics, and basic research questions and experiments that further elucidate the nature of the patientâ€™s presentation and underlying mechanism of disease.",PMC6093444,PMC6093444_1
"The Tools of Human Investigation (THI) course, led by a physician-scientist with NIH funding, introduces pathways for early career development, provides an overview of hypothesis generation and testing using various study designs, and teaches interpretation of the literature, presentation, writing, and research skills to prepare residents for leadership in their chosen fields.",PMC6093444,PMC6093444_2
"The Bigelow service, comprised of 6 resident teams, emphasizes a team-based approach to clinical care and education by having 6 resident teams, each with 4 interns, a junior assistant resident, and 2 attending physicians overseeing the care of 16-18 patients. The interns share responsibility for all patients and rotate through a 4-day cycle of tasks.",PMC6093444,PMC6093444_3
"The leadership of the residency program has active research investigators, including physician-scientists in infectious diseases, who use patients on the clinical service to drive intellectual curiosity and provide a framework for investigating the unknowns. This critical mass of faculty prominently seen by residents can have a lasting impact on their subsequent career choices.",PMC6093444,PMC6093444_4
