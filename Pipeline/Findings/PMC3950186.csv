"In a study published in 2012, the link between xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMRV) and prostate cancer was refuted due to the discovery that clinical cancer samples were contaminated with an XMRV-infected cell line from a laboratory in Cleveland, Ohio, but not in samples from 2012 in San Francisco, California.",PMC3950186,PMC3950186_0
"In the same study, the authors used gag RT-PCR to detect XMRV in cell lines from the Cleveland laboratory in 2003, but not in samples from 2012 in San Francisco.",PMC3950186,PMC3950186_1
"Another widely used German cell line, BANK DSMZ, did not report the origin of their cells in published works.",PMC3950186,PMC3950186_2
"The authors warned about the risk of cell contamination, as every lab shares cell lines between colleagues, facilitating the dissemination of contaminated cultures within and beyond institutions.",PMC3950186,PMC3950186_3
"To control viral contamination, it is recommended to report the cell origin in every published work, as proteomics easily detects contamination with any virus or other foreign organism, and viral contamination differs from microbial contamination in terms of the proteome size.",PMC3950186,PMC3950186_4
"The widely adopted practice in academia of sharing cell lines between colleagues may result in ""false alarm"" events due to the ""direct transfer"" of convenient data-analysis approaches widely used in single-organism proteomics, which may fail in the presence of high degrees of homology between retroviral proteins and human proteins.",PMC3950186,PMC3950186_5
"The authors suggested manual rechecking of the MS/MS spectra and peptide assignments, as well as the use of additional filtering based on delta score to reduce the amount of false positives.",PMC3950186,PMC3950186_6
"The authors also recommended that density plots of scores, delta scores, and normalized delta scores be used to help control false positives.",PMC3950186,PMC3950186_7
"In a study published in 2012, the authors identified five viral proteins in the proteomes of eleven cell lines by using the ANDROMeda search engine at a 1% FDR threshold by matching MS/MS spectra against a concatenated human-viral sequence database.",PMC3950186,PMC3950186_8
