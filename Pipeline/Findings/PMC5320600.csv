"The authors present a computational tool called k-pax2 that can identify clusters of influenza virus sequences based on their similarity in amino acid composition. This tool can also detect characteristic amino acid changes that are associated with functional sites, and it can differentiate between clusters based on their age or time of emergence.",PMC5320600,PMC5320600_0
"The authors applied k-pax2 to a large set of influenza A/H3N2 ha sequences, spanning from 1968 to the present day, and they identified 23 core clusters that have evolved through antigenic space. These clusters are related to each other in a manner that supports the conclusion that k-pax2 successfully identifies meaningful phenotypes.",PMC5320600,PMC5320600_1
"The authors also found that clusters often have a distinct set of characteristic amino acid changes, and that sequential changes in core characteristic sites rarely occur in close proximity, even when within the same epitope. This raises the possibility that selection tends to favor alternation across the protein surface, even within a single domain.",PMC5320600,PMC5320600_2
"The authors suggest that k-pax2 can extract evolutionary signals from microbial sequence collections and can provide a critically needed tool to guide studies of protein function and evolution. However, they also caution that like most statistical methods, the model-based clustering can be affected by sampling biases of various kinds.",PMC5320600,PMC5320600_3
"The authors conclude that there is a widening gap between the number of experimentally validated evolutionary mechanisms and the abundance of sequence data, and there is demand for computational tools that can aid in harvesting biologically meaningful signals from data to guide further research.",PMC5320600,PMC5320600_4
