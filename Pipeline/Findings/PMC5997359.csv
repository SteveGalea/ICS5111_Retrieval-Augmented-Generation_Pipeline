"The study identified multiple co-infections with arboviruses in patients in Haiti during the chikungunya epidemic, including co-infections with chikungunya virus and Zika virus, as well as co-infections with chikungunya virus and mayaro virus. The study also found a high genomic similarity of a Haitian mayaro virus isolate with a Brazilian strain isolated in 1960, suggesting that mayaro virus has been circulating in the human population at a sub-epidemic level, most likely in Brazil, for years and that it was introduced just recently onto Hispaniola.",PMC5997359,PMC5997359_0
"The study found that the strains of chikungunya, Zika, and mayaro viruses identified in Haiti during the chikungunya epidemic did not cluster with the viruses previously obtained in Haiti in 2014 and 2016, indicating multiple independent introductions of these arboviruses in Haiti between 2014 and 2016.",PMC5997359,PMC5997359_1
"The study's phylogenetic analysis suggested that the introduction of Zika virus in Haiti happened between 2008 and 2014, a time interval again overlapping with the estimated introduction of both chikungunya and mayaro viruses co-infecting strains circulating in Haiti inferred from the phylogenies.",PMC5997359,PMC5997359_2
"The study's phylogenetic analysis also indicated that the strains of chikungunya and Zika viruses found in patients in Haiti during the chikungunya epidemic did not cluster with the viruses previously obtained in Florida in 2016, as well as the multiple independent introductions of chikungunya, Zika, and mayaro viruses to Haiti inferred from the phylogenies, demonstrating the potential role of the Caribbean as a node for arbovirus infections connecting South, Central, and North America.",PMC5997359,PMC5997359_3
"The study's molecular clock analysis suggested that the median origin of the chikungunya co-infection strains was estimated to be April 2014, with 95% highest posterior density between January 2013 and January 20",PMC5997359,PMC5997359_4
