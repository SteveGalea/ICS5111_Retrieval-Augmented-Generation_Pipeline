"The authors constructed a series of ibv-based d-rnas containing the chifn-γ gene under the control of an ibv tas, allowing for the detection of biologically active chifn-γ following helper virus-dependent replication in vitro and in vivo.",PMC154032,PMC154032_0
Serial passage of the chifn-γ-containing d-rnas followed the same pattern of both d-rna replication and heterologous protein expression that the authors have previously observed for the expression of the heterologous reporter genes encoding cat and luciferase from ibv-based d-rnas.,PMC154032,PMC154032_1
"The authors demonstrated that ibv d-rnas containing the chifn-γ gene expressed similar amounts of active chifn-γ, indicating that the d-rnas expressed similar amounts of biologically active chifn-γ.",PMC154032,PMC154032_2
"The authors detected additional rna species, which were larger than the chifn-γ-containing d-rnas and ibv sg mrna 2, from p3, which increased in amount upon serial passage. These new d-rnas contained sequences derived from the 5′ end of the ibv genome and were not from the loss of the chifn-γ sequence.",PMC154032,PMC154032_3
The authors demonstrated that ibv d-rnas can be replicated in ovo from the presence of biologically active chifn-γ secreted into the allantoic fluid and subsequent passage on indicator ck cells. This observation allowed the authors to demonstrate that ibv d-rnas can be replicated in ovo from the presence of biologically active chifn-γ secreted into the allantoic fluid and subsequent passage on indicator ck cells.,PMC154032,PMC154032_4
