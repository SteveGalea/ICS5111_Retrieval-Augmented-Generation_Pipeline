"In a study by Capelli and colleagues, they demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) are effective in restoring dystrophin expression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients through exon-skipping. However, the high doses required and the potential toxicity of AOs limit their clinical applicability. To address these limitations, they developed a delivery system using nanoparticles (NPs) composed of a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) core and a random copolymer shell formed by units derived from N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM) and reactive methacrylate-bearing cationic groups. This system improved the binding capacity of AOs on the NP surface through the introduction of various reactive functional groups. The study also revealed the potential of NPs as nontoxic delivery vectors for AOs, as lower doses of AOs were required, reducing both the potential side effects and the duration of the administration schedule.",PMC3922138,PMC3922138_0
"A further study by Bassi and colleagues showed that the protective effect of NP-AO complexes on dystrophin expression persisted long after the end of the treatment, indicating the potential of NPs as delivery vectors for AOs. The study also revealed that the restored dystrophin was correctly localized on the sarcolemmal membrane of muscle fibers, and the western blotting analysis revealed a protein with the exact molecular weight in NP-AO treated mice, while this was undetectable in naked-AO treated mice.",PMC3922138,PMC3922138_1
"A study by Rimessi and colleagues showed that AO-loaded NPs, which abounded in various tissues and organs of Mdx mice treated via intraperitoneal injection, improved dystrophin restoration in both skeletal and cardiac muscles. The study also revealed that the effect of AO-loaded NPs on dystrophin expression persisted long after the end of the treatment, indicating the potential of NPs as delivery vectors for AOs.",PMC3922138,PMC3922138_2
