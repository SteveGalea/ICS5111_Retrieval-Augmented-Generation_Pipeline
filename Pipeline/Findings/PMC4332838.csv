"Non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors, such as nim811, alisporivir, and scy-635, have shown promising antiviral activity against hepatitis C (HCV) and hepatitis B (HBV) viruses in vitro and in clinical trials.",PMC4332838,PMC4332838_0
"These inhibitors target host factors, such as cyclophilins, that are critical for viral replication and assembly, rather than the viruses themselves.",PMC4332838,PMC4332838_1
"The development of cyclophilin inhibitors offers the potential benefit of a high barrier to resistance, broad genotype coverage, and an accelerated development path with known inhibitors and even the possibility of broad-spectrum antivirals.",PMC4332838,PMC4332838_2
"Cyclophilin inhibitors also appear to play an important role in the replication of other viruses, such as influenza, herpes simplex virus, human cytomegalovirus, vaccinia virus, and human papillomavirus.",PMC4332838,PMC4332838_3
"While challenges remain to better understand mechanisms of action and toxicity, the discovery and development of cyclophilin inhibitors exemplify the opportunities and challenges in pursuing host-targeting antivirals.",PMC4332838,PMC4332838_4
