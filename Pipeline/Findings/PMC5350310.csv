This study found that human respiratory virus (hRV) is a major cause of respiratory infections in addition to influenza A (FLUA) and human coronaviruses (hCOV-OC43) during winter season in the southwestern province of Saudi Arabia.,PMC5350310,PMC5350310_0
"The study showed that hRV is detectable in patients from most age groups, and coinfection was not uncommon, with hRV being the most commonly detected virus in coinfections.",PMC5350310,PMC5350310_1
"The study also found that mers-CoV, the causative agent of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), is infrequent in this region of Saudi Arabia compared to other regions, most likely due to the limited number of dromedary camels, the reservoir host for mers-CoV, and consequently their direct contact.",PMC5350310,PMC5350310_2
"The study showed that viral prevalence was almost similar in children under the age of 15 years and individuals older than 15 years, but the detection of respiratory viruses varied significantly between regions, suggesting that some centers may serve a large community in the region and could represent suitable sentinels for future surveillance studies.",PMC5350310,PMC5350310_3
The study highlights the importance of enhanced surveillance in understanding the epidemiology of respiratory infections and in the implementation of effective control measures by public health authorities.,PMC5350310,PMC5350310_4
