The newly discovered shigga virus (SHFV) causes fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in Asian macaques but benign persistent infections in African nosed horses.,PMC4449332,PMC4449332_0
"SHFV infection of cultured macaque mφs and mdcs induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, while infections in baboon cells did not.",PMC4449332,PMC4449332_1
"SHFV infection of Asian macaques caused fatal hemorrhagic fever disease, while variants of SHFV isolated from persistently infected baboons could lytically infect rhesus macaque mφs and ma104 cells.",PMC4449332,PMC4449332_2
"The SHFV genome encodes five additional proteins compared to other known arteriviruses, including an additional nsp1 region and an additional set of four minor structural proteins.",PMC4449332,PMC4449332_3
"Cells transfected with mutant viral rnas that did not express GP2', GP3', E, or E' did not produce extracellular virus particles, indicating that each of the minor structural proteins from both sets is required for the production of infectious SHFV.",PMC4449332,PMC4449332_4
