Drak2 is a negative regulator of tgf-β signaling in tumor cell lines [12].,PMC4423867,PMC4423867_0
"In primary T cells stimulated in vitro, drak2 does not function as a negative regulator of tgf-β signaling. Smad2/3 signaling after tgf-β stimulation was not enhanced in drak2 -/- T cells compared to wildtype T cells.",PMC4423867,PMC4423867_1
Drak2 -/- T cells exhibit comparable effects on activated CD8+ T cell accumulation and survival in response to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation as wildtype T cells.,PMC4423867,PMC4423867_2
Drak2 -/- T cells do not exhibit enhanced susceptibility to death compared to wildtype T cells following in vitro stimulation.,PMC4423867,PMC4423867_3
"Drak2 may not function as a negative regulator of tgf-β signaling in T cells during autoimmune disease, as tgf-β signaling is not enhanced in drak2 -/- T cells following in vitro stimulation.",PMC4423867,PMC4423867_4
