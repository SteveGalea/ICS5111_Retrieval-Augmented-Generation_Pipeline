"The novel human coronavirus hcov-emc efficiently replicates in both human bronchial and lung tissue ex vivo cultures, targeting type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells, as well as nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells.",PMC3676115,PMC3676115_0
"Hcov-emc infection in ex vivo lung tissue cultures also leads to extensive apoptosis, primarily via paracrine mechanisms, and interferon treatment can significantly suppress viral replication when added to the cultures 1 h after infection or continued into the postinfection period.",PMC3676115,PMC3676115_1
"Hcov-emc, like sars-cov, does not appear to induce interferon responses, including poor type I and III interferon responses, both in ex vivo lung tissue cultures and in the alveolar epithelial cell line a549.",PMC3676115,PMC3676115_2
"Hcov-emc, like sars-cov, does not appear to induce a prominent proinflammatory cytokine response, although other proinflammatory cytokines are potently induced, and ifn therapy may be of potential benefit.",PMC3676115,PMC3676115_3
"Hcov-emc, unlike influenza a h5n1 virus, does not appear to induce a dysregulated cytokine response, although other proinflammatory cytokines are potently induced, and ifn therapy can significantly suppress viral replication when added to the cultures 1 h after infection or continued into the postinfection period.",PMC3676115,PMC3676115_4
"The replication-competent cell lines, A549 and Calu-3, are of human origin, and both cell lines are derived from lung tissue.",PMC3676115,PMC3676115_5
