"A single-dose of a live replication-competent vsv-based vaccine, VSV-846, elicited a robust cellular immune response, including increased IFN-γ release, lymphocyte proliferation, and T cell cytotoxicity, in mice challenged with mycobacterium bovis bacilli Calmette-Guérin (BCG).",PMC5293745,PMC5293745_0
"VSV-846, which contains three M. Tb antigens, Rv3615c, M. Tb10.4, and Rv2660c, induced a long-lasting immune response against M. Tb infection in mice, with protection against BCG challenge observed at long-term intervals, including 12 and 24 weeks post-challenge, and a significant reduction in lung cfus.",PMC5293745,PMC5293745_1
"The vsv-based vaccine induced a large population of CD44+ and CD62llow memory T cells, which are important for controlling infection, in mice 24 weeks post-vaccination.",PMC5293745,PMC5293745_2
"VSV-846 elicited polyfunctional T cells proliferation that secrete multiple cytokines during infection, as evidenced by the clinical failure of MVA85a, and developed into long-lived memory T cells exhibiting enhanced capability to control infection.",PMC5293745,PMC5293745_3
"VSV-based vaccines, including VSV-846, have the potential to be a successful option for M. Tb-vaccine development due to their ability to induce robust cellular immune responses and memory T cell responses following a single-dose, as well as their capacity to protect vaccinated mice against BCG infection over long-term periods of time.",PMC5293745,PMC5293745_4
