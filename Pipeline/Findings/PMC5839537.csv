"In a study investigating the expression stability of 10 candidate genes from different functional classes in riverine buffaloes, uxt, rps23, rpl4, and rps9 were identified as the most reliable and stable reference genes using all three algorithms (genorm, normfinder, and bestkeeper) for accurate normalization of qPCR-based gene expression studies in buffalo tissues.",PMC5839537,PMC5839537_0
"The expression stability of Î²2m and rps15 was found to be the least stable in this study, as they showed the highest expression variability, making them non-suitable as reference genes for normalization of data.",PMC5839537,PMC5839537_1
"The study also highlighted the importance of using multiple reference genes to validate gene expression data across buffalo tissues, as the commonly used reference genes, actb and gapdh, showed unstable expression patterns.",PMC5839537,PMC5839537_2
"The results of this study provided a panel of reference genes that can be utilized during gene expression studies across buffalo tissues, and the geometric means of the identified stable reference genes would provide accurate normalization factors for expression data in buffalo tissues.",PMC5839537,PMC5839537_3
The study's findings supported the recommendation in several other studies that gene expression results might be more reliable if they are normalized by the geometric means of multiple reference genes for accurate interpretation of qPCR results.,PMC5839537,PMC5839537_4
