"The recent enactment of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) requires animal food manufacturers to identify and control animal food safety hazards due to the discovery of swine foodborne viruses, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which was not traditionally controlled by on-farm biosecurity measures.",PMC5667810,PMC5667810_0
"The current study demonstrates widespread contamination of PEDV occurred in an animal food manufacturing facility after PEDV swine food production and was detected on most surfaces, including animal food-contact surfaces.",PMC5667810,PMC5667810_1
"Some non-food contact swabs from a repetition were qPCR positive after a negative animal food was manufactured, although animal food tested was qPCR negative. This genetic material remained on boot due to inadequate cleaning after a previous replicate and was tracked then detected on the concrete floor.",PMC5667810,PMC5667810_2
Material collected from dust collection systems and sweepings should be collected and disposed instead of added to the product flow as per traditional measures due to the potential of possibly infectious PEDV.,PMC5667810,PMC5667810_3
"The proposed mitigation technique of feed batch sequencing was not effective to reduce environmental contamination, although the potential impact of PEDV contamination and importance to prevent virus entry in such facilities was better understood.",PMC5667810,PMC5667810_4
