"The study revealed that eav nsp1, a replicative polyprotein of the arterivirus family, is a multifunctional protein that participates in several steps of the viral life cycle, including translation of viral rna, replicase polyprotein processing, and sg rna synthesis.",PMC2045461,PMC2045461_0
"The study found that the nsp1 zf domain, a short, independently folded stretch of amino acids that requires the coordination of one or more zinc atoms to stabilize its higher-order structure, is essential for virus production and is involved in virion biogenesis.",PMC2045461,PMC2045461_1
"The study showed that the integrity of the zf domain was also found to be essential for virus production, and three of the mutants (c25h, h27c, and h27a) coupled a deviation of not more than twofold in the ratio of genome to sg mrna synthesis to a 2- to 5-log drop in infectious progeny titers.",PMC2045461,PMC2045461_2
"The study found that, in contrast to the cys-25→a and cys-41/cys-44 mutants, the conservative replacements of cys-25→his and his-27→cys, which in theory maintain the zinc-coordinating potential intact, were largely tolerated in terms of sg rna production, although these mutants were significantly impaired in a later stage of the viral life cycle, possibly virion biogenesis.",PMC2045461,PMC2045461_3
"The study revealed that a role of nsp1 in translation of viral rna also needs to be investigated, although a preliminary analysis did not reveal major deviations in structural protein synthesis for mutants like c25h.",PMC2045461,PMC2045461_4
