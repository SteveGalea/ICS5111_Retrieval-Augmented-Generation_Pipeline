"The human immune system generates a vast array of antibodies (abs) in response to pathogenic antigens, with each individual generating a unique repertoire of abs that provides protection against future infections.",PMC5656258,PMC5656258_0
"The germline-encoded immunoglobulin (ig) heavy-chain variable region (VH) gene locus, which encodes the majority of the heavy-chain variable region (VH) sequences in the human ab repertoire, contains multiple copies of the same or highly similar sequences that are thought to have arisen from class-switch recombination (CSR) events.",PMC5656258,PMC5656258_1
"The high prevalence of CSR-associated sequence identity and similarity at the ig VH locus, which has been termed ""germline gene convergence,"" suggests that the human immune system employs a restricted set of VH sequences to generate protective abs.",PMC5656258,PMC5656258_2
"Germline-encoded ig VH gene convergence is associated with biased usage of VH gene segments and framework regions, which in turn affects the structure and antigen binding capacity of the resulting abs.",PMC5656258,PMC5656258_3
Integration of germline genotype data into studies of the ab repertoire in disease and clinical phenotypes has the potential to provide important insights into ab signatures associated with protective responses and to inform tailored clinical care and treatment strategies.,PMC5656258,PMC5656258_4
