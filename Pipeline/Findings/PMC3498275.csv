"Self-collection of nasal swabs for viral respiratory pathogen detection is an acceptable, feasible, and valid method in a selected adult population.",PMC3498275,PMC3498275_0
"The self-collected swabs had similar acceptance, satisfaction, and sample adequacy to staff-collected swabs.",PMC3498275,PMC3498275_1
"The self-collected swabs had similar viral detection rates to staff-collected swabs, with substantial agreement in terms of viral detection.",PMC3498275,PMC3498275_2
"The self-collected swabs had higher median concentrations of host cell marker β-actin dna than staff-collected swabs, suggesting that participants applied higher swabbing pressure due to high confidence in the self-swabbing procedure.",PMC3498275,PMC3498275_3
"The self-collected swabs had similar median concentrations of host cell marker β-actin dna to staff-collected swabs collected at home, suggesting that the participants' confidence in the self-swabbing procedure persisted over time.",PMC3498275,PMC3498275_4
"(Optional finding) The self-collected swabs had similar median concentrations of host cell marker β-actin dna to staff-collected swabs collected at home, suggesting that the participants' confidence in the self-swabbing procedure persisted over time, even in the absence of study personnel.",PMC3498275,PMC3498275_5
"(Optional finding) The self-collected swabs had similar viral detection rates and sample adequacy to staff-collected swabs, suggesting that self-collection would be a highly cost-efficient way to obtain diagnostic nasal swabs in medium and large scale population-based studies on ari epidemiology.",PMC3498275,PMC3498275_6
"(Optional finding) Education level did not influence viral detection or β-actin dna levels, suggesting that self-collection would be a feasible and valid method for viral respiratory pathogen detection in the general population.",PMC3498275,PMC3498275_7
"(Optional finding) The self-collected swabs' viral detection rates and sample adequacy were similar to staff-collected swabs, suggesting that self-collection would be a feasible and valid method for viral respiratory pathogen detection in the general population, despite the fact that only two individuals with pcr-proven influenza virus infection were detected.",PMC3498275,PMC3498275_8
