"Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence staining showed that both mature and immature dendritic cells (DCs) can be infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), suggesting that cell types lacking ACE2, the functional receptor for SARS-CoV, may also be infected by SARS-CoV, and other receptors may be involved in virus entry.",PMC1895271,PMC1895271_0
"Initial postgenomic characterization of the SARS-CoV revealed 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, some of which are of high-mannose structure. This finding suggests that cell-mediated transfer of retroviral vectors pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein can bind to DC-SIGN and enter mature DCs, further supporting an important role played by DCs in SARS-CoV replication.",PMC1895271,PMC1895271_1
"SARS-CoV infection in DCs appears to be incomplete, as there was expression of the viral genome, including negative and positive strand RNA templates, but no increase in viral copies over 6 days of culture, no virus budding, or production of infectious virus into the culture medium.",PMC1895271,PMC1895271_2
"SARS-CoV infection in DCs did not induce significant cell death under light and electron microscopy or in active caspase-3 assays, suggesting that the immunosuppressive effect of SARS-CoV may not be mediated through direct cytopathic effect on DCs.",PMC1895271,PMC1895271_3
"SARS-CoV infection in DCs did not up-regulate the expression of CD83, CD86, MHC class I, or MHC class II molecules on immature DCs, but maturation of SARS-CoV-infected DCs can still be induced by LPS, suggesting that SARS-CoV did not impair DC maturation.",PMC1895271,PMC1895271_4
