"The study demonstrates that an approach integrating passenger flux data with viral genetic data provides a more accurate prediction of global epidemic spread than those which include only one source of information, as the prediction improvement of the combined data over the passenger flux data alone is not very large.",PMC3930559,PMC3930559_0
"The study suggests that the presence of the trunk lineage in mainland China and southeast Asia, a dominant signal for the presence of the trunk lineage, is likely to provide immediate risk maps for the transmission of avian influenza viruses (perhaps based on predictors calibrated against h5n1 avian influenza) and target h7n9 surveillance and control efforts.",PMC3930559,PMC3930559_1
"The study suggests that supporting information text describes additional information on the following topics: (i) sequence and location data, (ii) incorporating uncertainty in air community assignment, (iii) bayesian statistical analysis of sequence and trait evolution, and (iv) comparing simulated spatial expansion to recorded h1n1 pandemic data.",PMC3930559,PMC3930559_2
"The study indicates that should the virus remain restricted to avian hosts, risk maps for the transmission of avian influenza viruses (perhaps based on predictors calibrated against h5n1 avian influenza) and target h7n9 surveillance and control efforts would help to pinpoint worldwide regions of immediate risk.",PMC3930559,PMC3930559_3
The study shows that the study's framework is applicable to different infectious diseases and provides new opportunities for explicitly testing how host behavior and ecology shapes the spatial distribution of pathogen genetic diversity.,PMC3930559,PMC3930559_4
"The study highlights that passenger flux data among pairs of locations is symmetric, thus it is possible that the phylogeographic data is capable of capturing asymmetry in the seasonal process of viral spread, which may also be important in explaining the spatial expansion of pandemic h7n9.",PMC3930559,PMC3930559_5
The study implies that the degree of temporal stochasticity in the source location of seasonal viruses (perhaps based on predictors calibrated against h5n1 avian influenza) may help to target h7n9 surveillance and control efforts in china.,PMC3930559,PMC3930559_6
"The study suggests that the spatial expansion of pandemic h1n1 viruses is most powerfully investigated by incorporating passenger flux data with viral genetic data and that passenger flux data among pairs of locations is symmetric, thus it is possible that the phylogeographic data is capable of",PMC3930559,PMC3930559_7
