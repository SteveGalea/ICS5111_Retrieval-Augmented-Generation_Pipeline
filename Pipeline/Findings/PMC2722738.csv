"A model based on Canadian influenza surveillance data estimated a sensitivity for influenza testing of 30% to 40%, which is significantly lower than standard assay sensitivities documented in the literature.",PMC2722738,PMC2722738_0
The large number of false negative test results suggests a need for standardization of diagnostic test procedures and algorithms used in different laboratories.,PMC2722738,PMC2722738_1
The model suggests that false negative test results may be attributed to co-infection with other respiratory viruses.,PMC2722738,PMC2722738_2
"The model indicates that false negative test results may be attributed to sample quality, handling, and timing of collection after symptom onset.",PMC2722738,PMC2722738_3
Improved diagnostic accuracy is important for improving our understanding of influenza epidemiology and for guiding preventive and therapeutic interventions.,PMC2722738,PMC2722738_4
