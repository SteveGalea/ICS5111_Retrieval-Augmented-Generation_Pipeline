"The current study, which assessed the safety and dose-sparing capability of Advax, a novel delta inulin-based polysaccharide adjuvant, demonstrated that vaccine formulated with Advax adjuvant remained immunogenic even when reduced to 1/3rd or even 1/10th of the standard tiv dose. This finding is important because it shows that the vaccine's efficacy is not significantly affected by the lower dose, which could potentially lead to more widespread use of the vaccine.",PMC4949042,PMC4949042_0
"The study found that vaccine responses reached back as far as the very oldest influenza a/h3n2 strains, even in individuals who had received the vaccine with Advax adjuvant. This finding is significant because it demonstrates that the vaccine's immunogenicity is not significantly affected by the presence of the adjuvant, despite its potential to enhance vaccine action.",PMC4949042,PMC4949042_1
"The study revealed that enhanced vaccine immunogenicity or antigen-sparing should not be at the expense of tolerability or safety. This is important because it shows that the vaccine's safety profile is not significantly affected by the presence of the adjuvant, which could potentially lead to more widespread use of the vaccine.",PMC4949042,PMC4949042_2
"The study found that the frequency of systemic adverse effects was not significantly different in individuals who received the vaccine with Advax adjuvant compared to those who received the standard vaccine. This finding is significant because it demonstrates that the vaccine's safety profile is not significantly affected by the presence of the adjuvant, which could potentially lead to more widespread use of the vaccine.",PMC4949042,PMC4949042_3
"The study found that the mechanism of action of Advax adjuvant remains under intense study, with current evidence pointing toward a non-inflammatory enhancement of antigen presenting cell function as the means by which it enhances vaccine action. This finding is significant because it shows that further studies are needed to exactly quantify Advax's antigen-sparing effects, particularly in relation to t-cell responses.",PMC4949042,PMC4949042_4
