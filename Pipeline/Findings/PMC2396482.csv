"Licorice significantly inhibited as-induced apoptotic cell death in h4iie cells by blocking the activation of caspase-3, as shown by the reduction in the population of apoptotic cells and the inhibition of dna laddering.",PMC2396482,PMC2396482_0
Licorice also prevented as-induced cell death by reducing the population of necrotic cells and the activation of caspase-3.,PMC2396482,PMC2396482_1

"Licorice is a potent preventer of as-induced cytotoxicity, as shown by the significant reduction in cytotoxicity in h4iie cells with licorice pre-treatment, as well as the inhibition of as-induced apoptotic cell death and dna laddering.",PMC2396482,PMC2396482_4
