The study aimed to develop a novel antigen-detection assay for rapid and reliable assessment of nucleoprotein (np) antigen of mers-cov using structure-sensitive monoclonal antibodies (mabs).,PMC4837155,PMC4837155_0
"The study utilized the wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system to produce soluble np antigen, which allowed for the creation of antibodies sensitive to protein conformation.",PMC4837155,PMC4837155_1
"The study revealed that the ntd of np of many human coronaviruses share common sequences, indicating that highly species-specific mabs were obtained due to the appropriate design and native properties of the antigen.",PMC4837155,PMC4837155_2
The study demonstrated that the developed mabs can detect np antigens derived from existing isolates of mers-cov and are suitable for detection by either enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) or immunochromatography (ict).,PMC4837155,PMC4837155_3
"The study highlighted the feasibility and benefit of the developed assay for the clinical diagnosis of mers-cov infection, as the viral loads in lower respiratory tract and sputum of patients during acute infection are more than 106 copies/ml, making it feasible to detect viral antigens of mers-cov for clinical diagnosis at an early stage of infection.",PMC4837155,PMC4837155_4
