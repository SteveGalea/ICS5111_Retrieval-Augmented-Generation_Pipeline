"A new mutation, n63y, in the vp3 protein of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) was identified in fecal samples from mice.",PMC4817249,PMC4817249_0
"The n63y mutation in CMV resulted in increased virulence and replication of the virus in mice, as evidenced by increased tissue damage and viral titers in infected mice.",PMC4817249,PMC4817249_1
"The n63y mutation did not alter CMV binding to human or murine car, but did result in decreased binding to sulfated glycans and gags, which are components of heparan sulfate proteoglycans.",PMC4817249,PMC4817249_2
