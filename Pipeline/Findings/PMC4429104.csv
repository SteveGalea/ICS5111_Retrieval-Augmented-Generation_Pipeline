"This study reports on serological evidence of influenza A viruses in straw-colored fruit bats from Ghana, with around 30% of the bat population showing antibody detection against certain subtypes.",PMC4429104,PMC4429104_0
"The findings suggest that bats may constitute asymptomatic mammalian carriers of influenza A viruses, which have a wide geographical distribution in birds and are recognized as possible candidates to cause a future pandemic.",PMC4429104,PMC4429104_1
"The study found no significant association in seropositivity between sex, age groups, sampling year, and season, but as sample size was small, potentially significant associations might have been missed.",PMC4429104,PMC4429104_2
"The study highlights the need for further surveillance in birds to prevent unnoticed reassortment events between circulating avian or potentially human influenza A virus strains, resulting in variants with yet unknown zoonotic potential.",PMC4429104,PMC4429104_3
"The findings have implications for public health, as e. Helvum, the bat species studied, are widely consumed as bush meat in West Africa, and the implications of the findings from a public health perspective remain to be investigated.",PMC4429104,PMC4429104_4
