"The study identifies bcl6 as a critical regulator of neutrophil survival during influenza A virus (IAV) infection, which is restricted to the lungs and does not occur in the blood or bone marrow.",PMC6575592,PMC6575592_0
"Bcl6-deficient neutrophils in the lungs undergo enhanced apoptosis, leading to decreased neutrophil numbers in the lungs and bal fluid, which contributes to attenuation of host inflammation and disease severity following IAV infection.",PMC6575592,PMC6575592_1
"The study demonstrates that the attenuation of deleterious neutrophil responses with low doses of anti-Ly6g provides protection against lethal IAV infection, suggesting that excessive neutrophil recruitment is a hallmark of acute susceptibility to respiratory bacterial infections.",PMC6575592,PMC6575592_2
"The study identifies a role for Bcl6 in modulating neutrophil survival in the tissue, thereby regulating the severity of diseases following IAV infection, and further suggests that the precise roles of neutrophil Bcl6 in modulating differential disease outcomes following respiratory infections may ultimately depend on the type of pathogen.",PMC6575592,PMC6575592_3
"The study indicates that lung neutrophils express higher Noxa levels than blood and bone marrow neutrophils in wild-type mice, and Bcl6 deficiency further increases Noxa expression specifically in the lungs, suggesting that enhanced Noxa expression promotes lung neutrophil apoptosis through antagonizing Mc1 expression and/or function in Bcl6-deficient neutrophils.",PMC6575592,PMC6575592_4
