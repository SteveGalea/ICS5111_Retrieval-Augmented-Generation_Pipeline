"The study found that the expression of human IFITM2 and IFITM3 proteins in the suprainfected T cell line, Supt1, significantly enhances HIV-1 replication, as determined by measuring viral reverse transcriptase activity in culture supernatants at various time intervals.",PMC4349745,PMC4349745_0
"The study also found that the expression of human IFITM2 and IFITM3 proteins in Supt1 cells significantly improves HIV-1 infectivity, as determined by a virus cell-to-cell transmission assay.",PMC4349745,PMC4349745_1
"The study identified that hiv-1nl4-3/blam-vpr (an amount equivalent to 100 ng viral p24(ca)) in infected Supt1 cells (designated as donor cells) was significantly higher in cells mixed with un-infected Supt1 cells (designated as target cells), which had been labeled with a cell tracker bmqc (invitrogen), 40 hours post infection, as determined by flow cytometry.",PMC4349745,PMC4349745_2
"The study also found that the expression of human IFITM2 and IFITM3 proteins in Supt1 cells significantly improves HIV-1 infectivity, as determined by a flow cytometry assay in which the p24-positive donor and target cells were scored.",PMC4349745,PMC4349745_3
"The study further identified that the expression of human IFITM2 and IFITM3 proteins in Supt1 cells significantly improves HIV-1 infectivity, as determined by a flow cytometry assay in which the p24-positive donor and target cells were scored after staining with fitc-conjugated anti-HIV-1 p24 antibody, followed by staining with fitc or tritc conjugated secondary antibodies (1:100 dilution).",PMC4349745,PMC4349745_4
