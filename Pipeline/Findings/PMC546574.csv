"The study found that the lack of transcriptional activity observed for the canonical cs-s2 in the tgev coronavirus genome was due to the relatively low potential base-pairing scores between the cs-s2 and ctrs-b. This suggests that complementarity between trs-l and ctrs-b during sgmrna synthesis is restricted to a limited region, and only a restricted number of nucleotides within the trs are relevant for the transcription complex.",PMC546574,PMC546574_0
"The study also found that mutants increasing complementarity with trs-l by the 3′ trs synthesize larger amounts of mrna-s2 than 5′ trs mutants. This is most consistent with a model of sequence similarity-assisted, polymerase copy choice strand switching during minus-strand synthesis, where the cs within the trs acts as a dissociation signal from the genomic rna template in order to stimulate a strand transfer to the leader region, providing that duplex formation between trs-l and ctrs-b has reached a minimum δg.",PMC546574,PMC546574_1
The study confirmed that complementarity between trs-l and ctrs-b has been confirmed as a crucial regulating factor in the transcription process.,PMC546574,PMC546574_2
"The study also found that the relative order of body trss in the viral genome may also determine the relative amounts of sgmrnas, and most probably viral and host components involved in protein-rna and protein-protein recognition will also be decisive in transcription.",PMC546574,PMC546574_3
"The study showed that there is a correlation between δg values and the amount of mrna-s2, where for similar δg values, mutants extending complementarity with trs-l at the 3′ trs synthesize larger amounts of mrna-s2 than 5′ trs mutants. This suggests that sequences downstream of the cs are more decisive in the rdrp choice during minus-strand synthesis.",PMC546574,PMC546574_4
