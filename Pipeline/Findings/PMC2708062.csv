The study aimed to understand the mechanism of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-mediated signaling in focal adhesion complex (FAC) assembly and the role of focal adhesion proteins (FAP) in the process.,PMC2708062,PMC2708062_0
The authors used site-specific dichroism and global search molecular dynamics (GSMD) to study the structure of focal adhesion protein (FAP) and its interaction with FAP2.,PMC2708062,PMC2708062_1
The study found that FAP2 is a low-affinity binding partner of FAP and is required for the activation of FAK.,PMC2708062,PMC2708062_2
The authors also identified three different sequence lengths corresponding to focal adhesion protein (FAP) in the study.,PMC2708062,PMC2708062_3
"The study revealed that the tilt angle of the models, β, was taken as the average of the angles between each helix axis in the bundle and the bundle axis, and the helix axis was calculated as a vector with starting and end points above and below a defined residue, where the points correspond to the geometric mean of the coordinates of the five α carbons n-terminal and the five α carbons c-terminal to the defined residue.",PMC2708062,PMC2708062_4
