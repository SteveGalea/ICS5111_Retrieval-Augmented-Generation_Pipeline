The study found that aberrant complement activation plays a crucial role in paraquat poisoning-induced acute lung injury (ali).,PMC5908256,PMC5908256_0
The study showed that paraquat ingestion triggers a c5a-mediated cytokine storm in a primate model and in patients with paraquat-induced ali.,PMC5908256,PMC5908256_1
"The study demonstrated that blocking complement activation using a neutralizing anti-c5a antibody, ifx-1, significantly alleviated systemic inflammatory responses and associated ali in the paraquat-ingested primate model.",PMC5908256,PMC5908256_2
The study found that ifx-1 completely inhibited activation of cd11b on blood granulocytes from normal donors in plasma from paraquat-poisoned patients.,PMC5908256,PMC5908256_3
"The study suggests that blocking complement activation using ifx-1 may have clinical utility for patients suffering from ali induced by other chemical poisoning, in addition to paraquat poisoning.",PMC5908256,PMC5908256_4
