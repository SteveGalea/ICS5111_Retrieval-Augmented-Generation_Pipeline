"In the context of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ali), a total of 209 differentially expressed genes (degs) were identified, including 107 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes. Among these degs, hspa5, hsp90b1, and hla-dra were found to be downregulated and enriched in pathways associated with antigen processing and presentation, metabolism, and the immune response.",PMC5952104,PMC5952104_0
"In the context of systemic and pulmonary inflammation in ali, it was found that zbtb17, which is involved in cell cycle progression and lymphocyte development, and ube2d4, hspa5, and hsp90b1, which are associated with protein folding and secretion, may be involved in the pathomechanism of sepsis-induced ali.",PMC5952104,PMC5952104_1
"In the context of endothelial barrier integrity and repair in sepsis-induced ali, it was determined that ube2d4, hspa5, and hyou1, which are associated with protein folding and secretion, may participate in sepsis-induced ali through protein folding, assembly, and secretion.",PMC5952104,PMC5952104_2
"In the context of potential drug targets in sepsis-induced ali, drugs targeting degs, including adenosine-5'-diphosphate that acts on hsp90b1, may be developed as a novel therapeutic agent to treat patients with ali induced by sepsis.",PMC5952104,PMC5952104_3
"In the context of the mortality rate of patients with this condition being high, it was found that hspa5, hsp90b1, and hla-dra were downregulated and enriched in pathways associated with antigen processing and presentation, metabolism, and the immune response.",PMC5952104,PMC5952104_4
