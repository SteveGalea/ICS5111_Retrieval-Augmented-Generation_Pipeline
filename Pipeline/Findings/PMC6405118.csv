"The study identified distinct gene expression profiles in hospitalized infants with hrsv or hrv bronchiolitis, with the immune response to hrsv infection being more associated with the activation of interferonÎ³ signaling pathways and less related to neutrophil activation compared to hrv infection.",PMC6405118,PMC6405118_0
The study found that infants with hrsv infection had leukopenia and required more hospitalization days compared to hrv infection.,PMC6405118,PMC6405118_1
"The study identified potential host-response molecular markers for hrsv or hrv etiopathogenic diagnosis, including the gene CCDC177 with the highest fold-change (16.3).",PMC6405118,PMC6405118_2
"The study found that nine hgs-hubs had fold-change values greater than 2 and were involved in immune response, inflammatory, and apoptosis, with six of these genes being potential therapeutic targets or molecular markers.",PMC6405118,PMC6405118_3
"The study identified two gene coexpression network modules associated with hrsv or hrv infection and found that the hgs-hubs involved in inflammatory response, apoptosis, and autophagy were not the same in each group.",PMC6405118,PMC6405118_4
