"Circular proteins differ from linear proteins in having one additional peptide bond, giving them enhanced stability against breakdown by proteolytic enzymes and other biochemical advantages, making them attractive for agricultural, diagnostic, and pharmaceutical applications.",PMC3411035,PMC3411035_0
"Cyclotides, a large class of circular proteins found in plants and fungi, have a cystine knot and are particularly stable due to their structure. They disrupt membranes and have insecticidal, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties.",PMC3411035,PMC3411035_1
"Bacterial circular proteins, including pilins, bacteriocins, and cyanobactins, have well-understood biosynthetic pathways, and some show potential as food preservatives, bacterial infections treatments, or as anti-HIV agents.",PMC3411035,PMC3411035_2
"The human immune system uses θ-defensins, circular peptides encoded by two truncated α-defensin genes that contribute just 9 amino acids each to the mature cyclic peptide. Synthetic retrocyclin peptides corresponding to these gene sequences are potent anti-HIV agents and have shown promise as topical microbicides to prevent sexually transmitted HIV-1 infections.",PMC3411035,PMC3411035_3
"Biological chemists are making synthetic versions of naturally occurring circular proteins using thioester chemistry via native chemical ligation or recombinant DNA expression techniques, which can be used to make genetically encoded libraries of cyclic peptides for screening purposes. Remaining challenges include the development of assays to rapidly and specifically detect the presence of cyclic proteins and the delineation of their biosynthetic mechanisms.",PMC3411035,PMC3411035_4
