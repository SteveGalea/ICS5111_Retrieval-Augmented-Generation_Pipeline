"Chronic viral infections with long transmission intervals require mechanisms to avoid or reduce short-sighted evolution, as the potential for short-sighted evolution is a secret of viral success but can limit the capacity for short-sighted evolution. This is because viruses with long transmission intervals can only persist in a host population if viral populations that have undergone little short-sighted evolution remain available for onward transmission.",PMC5405858,PMC5405858_0
"For some viruses, such as human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), human T-lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-2), and hepatitis B virus (HBV), fast rates of within-host evolution are balanced by the transmission of less-evolved virus, rather than a process of adaptation and reversion, as the primary mechanism leading to a mismatch in evolutionary rates between within- and among-host levels.",PMC5405858,PMC5405858_1
"Evidence for this argument is available for six of the eight chronic RNA viruses (including DNA viruses with RNA intermediates) that are known to be prevalent in humans; less is known about the natural history and evolution of the other two viruses, human pegiviruses 1 and 2 (HPGV-1 and HPGCV-2), or for chronic RNA viruses infecting other animals.",PMC5405858,PMC5405858_2
"The ability of viruses to evolve rapidly is one of the secrets of their success, allowing them to evade host immune responses, evolve novel functions, and explore new niches. However, this genetic plasticity may, for a virus, represent a double-edged sword that needs to be controlled. Indeed, it could be that overcoming short-sighted evolution is a necessary condition for the success of some viruses.",PMC5405858,PMC5405858_3
"For a virus to be maintained in a host population, mechanisms for maintaining proposed germline lineages in viral populations could themselves be under selection. Evidence for this argument is available for six of the eight chronic RNA viruses (including DNA viruses with RNA intermediates) that are known to be prevalent in humans; less is known about the natural history and evolution of the other two viruses, human pegiviruses 1 and 2 (HPGV-1 and HPGCV-2), or for chronic RNA viruses infect",PMC5405858,PMC5405858_4
