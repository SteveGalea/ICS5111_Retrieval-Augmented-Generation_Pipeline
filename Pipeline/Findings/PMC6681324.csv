A study conducted in Sierra Leone found that ebola survivors who use traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) believe that these medicines boost their immune system. This is similar to findings in HIV/AIDS patients and individuals with musculoskeletal conditions in other contexts.,PMC6681324,PMC6681324_0
The study also showed that ebola survivors who use T&CM are highly likely to be driven by belief in the notion that T&CM is more natural than conventional medicine. This is similar to findings in cancer survivors and pregnant women in other contexts.,PMC6681324,PMC6681324_1
"The study found that ebola survivors who use T&CM want more control over their health. This is in line with insights from the current post-infectious sequelae literature in other contexts, including those among survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong.",PMC6681324,PMC6681324_2
The study revealed that ebola survivors who are T&CM users and non-users in Sierra Leone agreed that medical doctors should be able to advise their patients about T&CM. This is in contrast to some studies in other conditions and in other countries.,PMC6681324,PMC6681324_3
"The study limitations include that the data collected is self-reported, which may reflect recall bias, and that the findings are not necessarily representative of the perceptions and experiences of ebola survivors in other countries, as the study excluded survivors with conditions that limit their ability to accurately provide information or participate in the study and may put the research and other participants at risk.",PMC6681324,PMC6681324_4
