"The newly discovered rhabdovirus, basv, shares structural similarities with other rhabdovirus glycoproteins, such as the internal bipartite fusion loop motif, but its length is significantly greater, with an additional 100 to 150 amino acids.",PMC3754090,PMC3754090_0
"Mutations in the three aromatic amino acids in the fusion loops, which are critical for vsv-g-mediated fusion, also lead to a loss of function in basv-g.",PMC3754090,PMC3754090_1
"Basv-g, similar to vsv-g and certain herpesvirus glycoproteins, exists in a dynamic equilibrium of pre- and postfusion conformations, but its threshold ph to induce fusion activity is lower, at <5.5, and its temperature optimum is higher, keeping increasing at temperatures above 37Â°C.",PMC3754090,PMC3754090_2
"Basv-g, unlike vsv-g and chikv env, interacts with c-type lectins like dc-sign, dc-signr, and signr1 to enhance infection of lectin-expressing target cells.",PMC3754090,PMC3754090_3
The pseudotype system described in the study will be a practical tool to determine the seroprevalence and clinical relevance of basv infection and to allow the development of prophylactic and therapeutic intervention strategies for basv infection.,PMC3754090,PMC3754090_4
