"The crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of ibv mpro has been reported, but there are no structures available for group iii coronaviruses, which infect birds and are distinct from those belonging to groups i and ii, which mainly infect mammals.",PMC2330114,PMC2330114_0
The functional importance and absence of cellular homologues of ibv mpro identifies it as an attractive target for anti-coronavirus drug design.,PMC2330114,PMC2330114_1
"The structural and functional analysis of ibv mpro will be published elsewhere, but initial microcrystals were obtained from condition no. 41 of crystal screen i containing 20% peg 4000, 10% 2-propanol, 0.1 m Na HEPES ph 7.5.",PMC2330114,PMC2330114_2
"The crystals belong to space group P6122, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 119.1, c = 270.7 Å, and the solvent content is estimated to be 55%, assuming the presence of three molecules in the asymmetric unit predicted from a self-rotation function calculated using CCP4.",PMC2330114,PMC2330114_3
"Diffraction data were collected at a wavelength of ∼1.0 Å with a MAR 345 image-plate detector, and from 357 356 observed reflections, 31 778 independent reflections were selected according to the criterion for observed reflections [i/σ(i) > 0]. The selected data-collection and processing statistics are given in Table 1.",PMC2330114,PMC2330114_4
