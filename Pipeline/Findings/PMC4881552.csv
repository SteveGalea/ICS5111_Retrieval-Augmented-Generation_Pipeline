"The study demonstrates that pedf, a protein involved in cell proliferation, migration, and survival, plays a protective role against dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts, a cell model commonly used to study osteoblast biology.",PMC4881552,PMC4881552_0
"The study reveals that dexamethasone downregulates pedf expression, contributing to osteoblast apoptosis, which has not been reported before.",PMC4881552,PMC4881552_1
The study suggests that pedf may be an important and indispensable factor in stabilizing the bone microenvironment and protecting against glucocorticoid (GC) toxicity.,PMC4881552,PMC4881552_2
"The study provides evidence that pedf is a novel target in GC-induced osteoblast apoptosis and suggests that GCs downregulate pedf expression, which contributes to osteoblast apoptosis.",PMC4881552,PMC4881552_3
The study highlights the need for further in vivo assays to confirm the findings and to investigate the detailed regulatory mechanisms and the effects of pedf on pro-osteogenesis under GC treatment.,PMC4881552,PMC4881552_4
