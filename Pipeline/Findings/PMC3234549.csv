"The authors present a method for estimating the transmission tree of an epidemic using a combination of genetic, geographical, and temporal data. This method is robust to changes in the number of nucleotides that could mutate, n, in the range from the total number of nucleotides seen to mutate to the total number of nucleotides sampled.",PMC3234549,PMC3234549_0
"The authors find that farms with fewer than 1000 animals, which includes all hobby farms by definition, are less infectious than other types of farms. This is consistent with previous results by Bavinck et al. (2011), who estimated parameters of a distance kernel without genetic information.",PMC3234549,PMC3234549_1
"The authors find a peculiar dichotomous relation between farm size and infectiousness, which might be explained by large farms being detected and culled before a substantial number of animals could get infected, or by a mechanism of spread that is not very sensitive to the amount of infectious particles present in a farm.",PMC3234549,PMC3234549_2
"The authors suggest that constructing intuitively plausible likelihood functions for each of the data types and combining them in a straightforward manner is a natural way to weigh different types of data. This is in contrast to a method suggested by Cottam et al. (2013), who assess data types sequentially and disregard any further information in the likelihoods that were derived from genetic data otherwise.",PMC3234549,PMC3234549_3
"The authors suggest that the method presented in this paper is applicable in a wide range of settings, including epidemics of rapidly mutating pathogens such as viruses, and that techniques such as those presented here coupled with our increasing capacity to build up large (genetic) datasets will allow for the accurate and correct estimation of transmission trees in a variety of settings, increasing our understanding of disease dynamics.",PMC3234549,PMC3234549_4
