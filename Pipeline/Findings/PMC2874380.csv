"During the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak, the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System (NSLIJs) laboratory responded by expanding its testing capacity, implementing a real-time biostatistical reporting system, and deploying an enhanced workforce, including nonlicensed support staff, licensed research staff, laboratory information services personnel, and biostatistical reporting staff.",PMC2874380,PMC2874380_0
"The NSLIJs laboratory was able to process over 34,000 tests for 11,624 patients, which would normally equal the amount of testing performed over a 1-year period, during the peak of the outbreak.",PMC2874380,PMC2874380_1
"The laboratory identified 169 confirmed or probable pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases through molecular diagnostics laboratory testing, with the ability to subtype influenza a, ruling out seasonal subtypes H1 and H3 and detecting additional respiratory viruses by rvp assay (8) within 24 hours.",PMC2874380,PMC2874380_2
"The outbreak began to subside at the end of June 2009, and 8,766 rapid influenza A tests, 8,754 rapid influenza B tests, 8,858 dfa assays, 5,786 viral cultures, and 4,853 rvp assays (36.9% with nonsubtypeable influenza A results) had been performed.",PMC2874380,PMC2874380_3
"The laboratory experienced a toll on its personnel, with initial implementation of the emergency response only enabling the laboratory to keep up with the crisis, not go beyond it, and routine personnel worked extended hours, despite the support of cross-covering personnel, owing to the high level of expertise required to perform the virology and molecular testing.",PMC2874380,PMC2874380_4
