"Human coronavirus strain 229e (HCov-229e), commonly causing the common cold, is increasingly linked to more severe respiratory infections in vulnerable populations.",PMC5701476,PMC5701476_0
"The virus has neuroinvasive and neurotropic properties and has been isolated from clinical samples, but primarily from respiratory specimens.",PMC5701476,PMC5701476_1
"During a suspected arbovirus outbreak in Haiti, HCov-229e and human alphaherpesvirus 1 were isolated from a child's plasma, making it the first reported isolation from human plasma.",PMC5701476,PMC5701476_2
"Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the Haitian HCov-229e isolate is closely related to American strains reported in 2015, but with unique nucleotide polymorphisms affecting polyprotein 1ab, spike, accessory, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins.",PMC5701476,PMC5701476_3
"The study's findings highlight the potential for HCov-229e to cause severe respiratory infections, particularly in vulnerable populations, and the need for further research on the virus's pathogenesis and potential treatments.",PMC5701476,PMC5701476_4
