"Biodiversity hotspots are not necessarily disease emergence hotspots. While areas with high biodiversity may be at high risk of disease emergence due to high pathogen hazards, this relationship is not necessarily consistent. Anthropogenic impacts, such as land-use change, can alter both biodiversity and disease risk independently. For example, land-use change can cause biodiversity loss, fragmentation, and homogenization, which can increase the risk of disease emergence by increasing similarity among ecological communities favouring generalist host species over habitat and dietary specialists. Land-use change can also introduce human-associated invasive species, which can act as bridge and amplifying hosts, increasing pathogen prevalence and transmission. Anthropogenic impacts also affect pathogens, increasing pathogen prevalence in reservoir hosts and increasing contact among humans, livestock, and wildlife.",PMC5413877,PMC5413877_0
