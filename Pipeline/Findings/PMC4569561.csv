"In both epidemics of H7N9 in Guangdong province, exposure to live poultry was common in both urban and rural areas. However, during the winter 2013-14 epidemic, exposure to live poultry declined in urban residents, likely due to the H7N9 epidemic.",PMC4569561,PMC4569561_0
"A minority of urban respondents (around one-third) supported permanent closure of live poultry markets (LPMs) in both surveys, despite the higher level of worries and perceived risk of infection during the second survey.",PMC4569561,PMC4569561_1
"Contact with live poultry was regarded as a possible route of H7N9 transmission by most rural respondents, but there was no apparent reduction in backyard poultry exposure reported by them.",PMC4569561,PMC4569561_2
"The higher level of worries and perceived risk of infection during the second survey did not necessarily result in a change in raising backyard poultry in rural areas, implying that decision-making on raising backyard poultry may not be driven by these factors.",PMC4569561,PMC4569561_3
The authors suggest that further efforts are needed to protect public health if H7N9 re-emerges in a third epidemic in the winter of 2014-15.,PMC4569561,PMC4569561_4
