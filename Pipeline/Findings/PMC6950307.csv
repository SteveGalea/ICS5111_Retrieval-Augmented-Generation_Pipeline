"The study found that tilapia lake virus (tilv) did not agglutinate rbcs from any of the species included, indicating an absence of surface proteins able to agglutinate rbcs.",PMC6950307,PMC6950307_0
"The study showed that tilv did not inhibit or enhance tilv replication in e-11 cells treated with nh4cl, suggesting that it could use uptake mechanisms that are different from orthomyxoviruses.",PMC6950307,PMC6950307_1
"The study found that the influenza virus strain a/puerto rico/8 (pr8) agglutinated avian and piscine rbcs, while isav only agglutinated atlantic salmon and tilapia rbcs, with weak agglutination observed for the latter.",PMC6950307,PMC6950307_2
"The study revealed that isav, which specifically binds neu4,5ac2 glycans on host cells, mostly binds fish rbcs, unlike other orthomyxoviruses, which bind a wide range of rbcs from different avian, mammalian, and piscine species.",PMC6950307,PMC6950307_3
"The study found that after ha binding to sia receptors on host cells, the virus is taken up into endosomal compartments by endocytosis, and after viral uncoating, nucleoproteins required for virus replication by acid-dependent cellular proteases are released, leading to virus replication by acid-dependent cellular proteases.",PMC6950307,PMC6950307_4
