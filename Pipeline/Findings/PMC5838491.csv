"The pomegranate leaf hydroalcoholic extract, rich in kaempferol and other bioactive molecules, significantly reduces lung inflammation and collagen deposition in mice intranasally challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",PMC5838491,PMC5838491_0
"Eafpg, the major compound in the pomegranate leaf hydroalcoholic extract, suppresses lung inflammation by decreasing gene expression and protein levels of proinflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6, in the lung tissue of mice with LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI).",PMC5838491,PMC5838491_1
"Eafpg also reduces neutrophil migration into the alveoli of mice with LPS-induced ALI, contributing to the attenuation of inflammatory disorders in which neutrophils play a crucial role.",PMC5838491,PMC5838491_2
"The authors suggest that eafpg may be used as food supplements to prevent inflammatory disorders due to its anti-inflammatory properties, as previously demonstrated for the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from pomegranate leaves in rats and mice with acute peritonitis and LPS-induced lung injury, respectively.",PMC5838491,PMC5838491_3
The authors emphasize the need for further studies to address the effects of eafpg in later time points of ALI and to evaluate its potential as a food supplement for preventing inflammatory disorders in which neutrophils play a crucial role.,PMC5838491,PMC5838491_4
