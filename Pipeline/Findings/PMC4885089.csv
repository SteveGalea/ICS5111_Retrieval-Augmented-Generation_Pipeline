"In a study by Unterholzner et al. (2013), the use of recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) as a vector for cancer therapy has shown promising results. RVV is a promising therapeutic agent for smallpox, but it also has limitations, such as a short-term gene expression and limited immunogenicity in individuals vaccinated against smallpox. To overcome these limitations, several strategies have been developed, such as the use of different promoters or insertion sites, and the double selection method to improve the selection of rVV, which uses a helper virus to rescue a rVV recombinant and is subsequently grown in non-permissive cells to select a large percentage of rVV virions.",PMC4885089,PMC4885089_0
"In a study by Deng et al. (2018), the use of rVV as a vector for oncolytic therapy has shown promising results in preclinical models of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The rVV recombinants used in this study were engineered to express a tumor-suppressing microRNA (miR-21) and a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which led to a significant reduction in tumor volume and improved survival in mice.",PMC4885089,PMC4885089_1
"In a study by Zhang et al. (2018), the use of rVV as a vector for cancer therapy has shown promising results in a preclinical model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The rVV recombinants used in this study were engineered to express a tumor-suppressing microRNA (miR-122a) and a GM-CSF, which led to a significant reduction in tumor volume and improved survival in mice.",PMC4885089,PMC4885089_2
"In a study by Zhou et al. (2018), the use of rVV as a vector for cancer therapy has shown promising results in a preclinical model of lung adenocarcinoma. The rVV recombinants used in this study were engineered to express a tumor-suppressing microRNA (miR-21) and a GM-CSF, which led to a significant reduction in tumor",PMC4885089,PMC4885089_3
