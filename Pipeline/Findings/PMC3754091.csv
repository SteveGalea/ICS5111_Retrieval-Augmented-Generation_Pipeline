"The study identifies palmitoylation on conserved and nonconserved cysteines of mifitm1, a viral restriction factor, as a mechanism for regulating protein stability and abundance.",PMC3754091,PMC3754091_0
"Palmitoylation on mifitm1 prevents its proteasomal degradation and promotes higher cellular levels of the protein, which is important as the protein is instable in the absence of palmitoylation.",PMC3754091,PMC3754091_1
"Overexpression of the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC7, which increases palmitoylation, leads to a 4-fold increase in mifitm1 palmitoylation and a corresponding 1.8-fold increase in its protein level.",PMC3754091,PMC3754091_2
"The study shows that mutation of the three conserved cysteines of mifitm1 leads to an increased rate of infection compared to wt mifitm1, demonstrating a role for these cysteines in antiviral activity.",PMC3754091,PMC3754091_3
"The study reveals that palmitoylation of mifitm1 at the conserved and nonconserved cysteines is required for anti-influenza virus activity, increasing the support for an intramembrane topology with both n and c termini facing the cytoplasm.",PMC3754091,PMC3754091_4
