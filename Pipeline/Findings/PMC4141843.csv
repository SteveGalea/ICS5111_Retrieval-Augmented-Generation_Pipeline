"A novel canine circovirus, designated as dog circovirus (dogcv), has been discovered in a dog with symptoms of enteritis in Italy. Long-term storage at low temperatures hindered histopathological analysis, but the virus was successfully isolated from the dog's tissue using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The dogcv genome, similar to those of other animal circoviruses, contains two intergenic noncoding regions and a conserved nucleotide stretch. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that dogcv is closely related to other canine circoviruses and less related to porcine circovirus 2 (pcv-2), which has been associated with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in swine.",PMC4141843,PMC4141843_0
"The discovery of dogcv extends the geographical distribution of circoviruses to the European continent. The virus has been detected in a dog with symptoms of enteritis, suggesting a possible association between dogcv and canine enteritis. However, further studies are needed to assess the pathogenic and epidemiological features of this novel canine agent.",PMC4141843,PMC4141843_1
"The full-length genome of the prototype strain, designated as dogcv strain Bari/411-13, was determined, revealing close genetic relatedness to the American viruses. The virus isolation attempts using different canine cell lines were unsuccessful, although the cycle threshold (ct) values obtained in real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification were suggestive of high viral titers in the inocula.",PMC4141843,PMC4141843_2
"The data gathered in this study suggest that dogcv has been circulating in dogs for at least 5 years before being discovered. The viral genome contains 36 amino acid substitutions in the replicase and 6 substitutions that are unique to the Italian circovirus, compared with other dog circoviruses. The capsid protein, 270 amino acids in length, contains a 30-amino acid-rich region in arginine residues, as observed in other circoviruses.",PMC4141843,PMC4141843_3
"The discovery of dogcv highlights the need for further studies to clarify better the pathogenic potential of this novel canine agent. Although the virus is closely related to other canine circoviruses, its pathogenic and epidemiological features remain unclear. The possible",PMC4141843,PMC4141843_4
