"In the 2003 SARS epidemic in Guangzhou, the n protein of SARS-CoV could be detected as early as day 1 and until day 18 in 420 serum specimens from 317 patients.",PMC3329003,PMC3329003_0
"The sensitivity of detecting n protein in blood samples taken during the first 5 days of symptoms was 94%, while the sensitivity decreased to 27% on days 11-20.",PMC3329003,PMC3329003_1
"The detection rate of n protein decreased from day 10 after onset of symptoms when antibodies against SARS-CoV appeared, but n protein was still detectable at high levels from day 7 to day 18 in 11 patients.",PMC3329003,PMC3329003_2
The positive detection rate of n protein in serum samples within the first 10 days of infection was higher than that detected by RT-PCR.,PMC3329003,PMC3329003_3
"A viral antigen-capture ELISA may have greater sensitivity, specificity, and ease and reliability of in-use performance than nucleic acid amplification assays for SARS diagnosis.",PMC3329003,PMC3329003_4
