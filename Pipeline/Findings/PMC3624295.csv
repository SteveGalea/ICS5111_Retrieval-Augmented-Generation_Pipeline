"The study found that a mutation in the activation ph of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, specifically the k582i mutation, decreased the HA activation ph from 5.9 to 5.4 in the c58 strain of H5N1 influenza viruses, which supported their growth in a mammalian model while having a deleterious effect on H5 growth in avian species.",PMC3624295,PMC3624295_0
"The study showed that the HA activation ph is a novel interspecies adaptation marker, helping to understand the properties necessary for influenza viruses to cross the species barrier.",PMC3624295,PMC3624295_1
"The study revealed that avian H5N1 influenza viruses with low pathogenicity in avian species due to a relatively low HA activation ph, such as the c58 HA-k582i mutant, may constitute a greater risk to mammals.",PMC3624295,PMC3624295_2
"The study demonstrated that the HA activation ph is a molecular marker for increased adaptation to mammals, which can assist scientists and public health authorities in making decisions related to culling animals, quarantining humans, selecting prepandemic vaccine seed stocks, rapidly producing immunogenic vaccines, and identifying viable drug targets such as the HA stalk.",PMC3624295,PMC3624295_3
"The study has implications for viral infectious diseases in general, as many enveloped viruses invade cells after their fusion glycoprotein is triggered by a low ph, and the tropism and host range of other important human and agricultural pathogens may also be influenced by the ph of activation of their fusion protein.",PMC3624295,PMC3624295_4
