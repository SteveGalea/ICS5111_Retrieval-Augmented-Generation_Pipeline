"Fragment-based drug design (FBD) is a promising approach for addressing the challenges of drug discovery tomorrow. This approach involves the assembly of molecular fragments, selected based on their involvement in organic reactions that are in the core competence of the in-house pharmacochemist, or a set of other virtual organic reaction schemes, to optimize the synthetic accessibility of the candidate compounds. FBD techniques already contributed to generating an impressive number of high affinity ligands and drug leads for clinical trials, although experimental high-throughput screening (HTS) hits are known to be synthesizable, since they have already been synthesized to be present in the tested molecules collection.",PMC3823351,PMC3823351_0
"FBD can provide the medicinal chemist with rational support to guide his ideas about valuable new chemical entities, and thus help the development of novel and patentable leads. This is because FBD-designed molecules can provide a starting point for more involved studies, and the results of this search will provide commercially available molecules, thus for which the synthesis has likely been described and optimized.",PMC3823351,PMC3823351_1
"FBD can optimize the synthetic accessibility of the candidate compounds by selecting potential precursors from databases of available compounds based on the assessment of the synthetic feasibility of molecules by examining their chemical structures, without suggesting any retro-synthesis.",PMC3823351,PMC3823351_2
"FBD can provide a starting point for more involved studies because once a few fragments have been successfully assembled in the active site, another option is to screen databases like ZINC for compounds containing this motif, and the results of this search will provide commercially available molecules, thus for which the synthesis has likely been described and optimized.",PMC3823351,PMC3823351_3
"FBD can help its experimental counterpart by reducing drastically the number of molecules that will be effectively tested. This is because FBD-designed molecules can provide the medicinal chemist with rational support to guide his ideas about valuable new chemical entities, and thus help the development of novel and patentable leads. FBD-designed molecules can provide a starting point for more involved studies, and the results of this search will provide commercially available molecules, thus for which the synthesis has likely been described and optimized. FBD-designed molecules can also provide the medicinal chemist with rational support to guide his ideas about valuable new chemical entities, and thus",PMC3823351,PMC3823351_4
