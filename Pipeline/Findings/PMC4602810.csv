"This study found that only about 10% of asthmatics had evidence of germs in their airways, with no clear association between asthma and the microbiome.",PMC4602810,PMC4602810_0
"The study did not find evidence of respiratory viruses in the airways of most asthmatics, despite previous studies suggesting a link between these germs and asthma.",PMC4602810,PMC4602810_1
"The study found an increased incidence of individual microbes, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, and Candida albicans, but without clear evidence of a link between these germs and asthma.",PMC4602810,PMC4602810_2
"The study did not find an infectious etiology of asthma, as it was neither able to identify an increased incidence of microorganisms in patients with various types of asthma during an episode of infection nor during infection-free periods.",PMC4602810,PMC4602810_3
"The study found that, in non-invasive techniques such as induced sputum, a finding of feno provides results that are as reliable as those of the traditional gold-standard methods such as bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial aspirate by flexible bronchoscopy for diagnosing asthma.",PMC4602810,PMC4602810_4
"The study demonstrated that, in non-invasive techniques such as induced sputum, a finding of feno can be used to diagnose asthma and is a useful biological medium for the determination of harmful dust, as bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage has become an important diagnostic tool in asthma.",PMC4602810,PMC4602810_5
"The study found that working asthmatics have an increased risk for infection with Staphylococcus aureus, but the association between Staphylococcus aureus and asthma cannot be confirmed by the study's results due to the small number of patients with Staphylococcus aureus infections in the study population.",PMC4602810,PMC4602810_6
"The study did not find evidence of a connection between Streptococcus pneumoniae and asthma, despite previous studies suggesting that Streptococcus pneumoniae can affect the course of asthma and may be connected to eosinophilic inflammation in asthma.",PMC4602810,PMC4602810_7
