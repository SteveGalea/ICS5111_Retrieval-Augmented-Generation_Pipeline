"The study identified three proteins, CHCHD2, TRIM27, and IFITM3, that were differentially regulated in response to HSV-1 infection.",PMC6930547,PMC6930547_0
"The study found that the expression of CHCHD2 was upregulated by HSV-1 infection, and its knockdown resulted in a decrease in HSV-1 replication and viral titers.",PMC6930547,PMC6930547_1
"The study also found that the expression of TRIM27 was upregulated by HSV-1 infection, and its overexpression resulted in a decrease in HSV-1 replication and viral titers.",PMC6930547,PMC6930547_2
"The study discovered that the expression of IFITM3 was downregulated by HSV-1 infection, and its overexpression resulted in an increase in HSV-1 replication and viral titers.",PMC6930547,PMC6930547_3
"The study utilized a combination of mass spectrometry, Western blotting, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to identify and quantify differentially regulated proteins in response to HSV-1 infection.",PMC6930547,PMC6930547_4
