"The study compared the phylogenetic relationship among four taxa, including Arabian oryx (O. Leucoryx), scimitar horned oryx (O. Dammah), plains oryx (O. Gazella), and Addax nasomaculatus, using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from three different regions: 16S rRNA, cytochrome-b (cyt-b), and d-loop.",PMC2614192,PMC2614192_0
The study found that 16S rRNA and cytochrome-b sequences had fewer substitutions and a higher frequency of identical sequences compared to the d-loop region.,PMC2614192,PMC2614192_1
"The study used three different methods for phylogenetic analysis: Bayesian (ba), Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), and Maximum Parsimony (MP).",PMC2614192,PMC2614192_2
"The study found that the ba model with gamma correction produced identical trees for all three regions of mtDNA, distinguishing between the genus Addax and oryx and grouping oryx dammah with oryx leucoryx.",PMC2614192,PMC2614192_3
"The study found that the MP method failed to distinguish between the genus Addax and oryx and that the phylogeny inferred from MP method differed from the ba and UPGMA methods, particularly for the d-loop region.",PMC2614192,PMC2614192_4
"The study highlights the importance of knowledge of relatedness between individuals for captive breeding programs in conservation genetics, as genetically impoverished endangered populations may fail to exhibit signs of recovery until crossed with individuals from other populations.",PMC2614192,PMC2614192_5
"The study recommends the need for conservation efforts to preserve genetic identity of various oryx groups, as genetically impoverished endangered populations often fail to exhibit signs of recovery until crossed with individuals from other populations.",PMC2614192,PMC2614192_6
"The study emphasizes the importance of utilizing the high levels of informative variation in mitochondrial regions for resolving taxonomic relationships in conservation genetics using appropriate bioinformatics tools, particularly for small populations.",PMC2614192,PMC2614192_7
"The study highlights the importance of utilizing the high mutation rate of mtDNA compared to nuclear genes for estimating relatedness between individuals in conservation genetics, as the high levels of informative variation in mtDNA sequences render them to",PMC2614192,PMC2614192_8
