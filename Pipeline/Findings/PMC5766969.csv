"The study identified a peptide sequence, pep87, that inhibits influenza virus entry by binding to the prefusion metastable conformation of the viral envelope protein, hemagglutinin (HA), with high specificity and low cytotoxicity.",PMC5766969,PMC5766969_0
"The study showed that pep87 binding to HA disrupts HA-mediated function without disrupting HA quaternary structure, indicating significant structural perturbation of the HA tertiary structure.",PMC5766969,PMC5766969_1
"The study demonstrated that pep87 binding to HA results in a large increase in solvent exposure of tryptophan groups, suggesting significant structural perturbation of the HA tertiary structure without disruption of the HA quaternary structure.",PMC5766969,PMC5766969_2
"The study revealed that pep87 binding to HA results in a large increase in solvent exposure of tryptophan groups, indicating significant structural perturbation of the HA tertiary structure.",PMC5766969,PMC5766969_3
The study showed that the prefusion metastable conformation of HA is a viable therapeutic target for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of viral entry.,PMC5766969,PMC5766969_4
