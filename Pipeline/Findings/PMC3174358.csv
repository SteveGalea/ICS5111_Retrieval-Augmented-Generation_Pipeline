"Adem is characterized by multifocal neurologic abnormalities with encephalopathy, often presenting as confusion, excessive irritability, or altered level of consciousness.",PMC3174358,PMC3174358_0
"Common symptoms of adem include long tract signs, such as pyramidal tract signs, acute hemiparesis, cerebellar ataxia, cranial neuropathies, including optic neuritis, and spinal cord dysfunction.",PMC3174358,PMC3174358_1
"Optic neuritis is characterized by vision loss, pain with eye movement, and an afferent pupillary defect.",PMC3174358,PMC3174358_2
Spinal cord dysfunction in adem is characterized by flaccid paralysis of the legs with a change in sensory level on examination.,PMC3174358,PMC3174358_3
"In children, a single clinical attack of adem does not necessarily indicate a monophasic disease, as recurrence may occur, leading to a diagnosis of multiphasic adem or ms, based upon the clinical symptoms and neuroimaging findings.",PMC3174358,PMC3174358_4
"In adem, brain MRI criteria include focal or multifocal lesions predominantly involving white matter, without evidence of previous white-matter changes.",PMC3174358,PMC3174358_5
"In adem, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) criteria include pleocytosis and/or increased protein concentration in the majority of patients, although this finding is more often associated with multiple sclerosis (MS).",PMC3174358,PMC3174358_6
"Diagnostic criteria for adem in children have been proposed by the International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group (2013), including major criteria of a clinical attack of CNS demyelinating disease with acute or subacute onset, polysymptomatic neurologic features, and encephalopathy.",PMC3174358,PMC3174358_7
"In adem, brain MRI findings are similar to those seen in MS, including large confluent intramedullary lesions that extend over multiple segments in the spinal cord.",PMC3174358,PMC3174358_8
"In adem, the diagnostic criteria can distinguish between monophasic adem with early relapses, recurrent forms of adem, and MS on the basis of new and fluctuating symptoms occurring within 3 months of the initial event or symptoms that appear during tapering of glucocorticoid therapy or within 1 month of completing a glucocorticoid taper.",PMC3174358,PMC3174358_9
