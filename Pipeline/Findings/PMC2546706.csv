"The study compared the diagnostic yields of nasopharyngeal (NP) and nasal (NS) specimens using three laboratory methods (IF test, culture, and PCR assay) for five respiratory viruses (adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1-4, and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]).",PMC2546706,PMC2546706_0
The overall sensitivity of viral detection using NP specimens was significantly higher than that obtained using NS specimens for all three methods of specimen collection.,PMC2546706,PMC2546706_1
"When the IF method was used, the sensitivity obtained using NP specimens was significantly higher than that obtained using NS specimens for influenza B virus and RSV, but this was not the case for the other three viruses.",PMC2546706,PMC2546706_2
"When culture was used, the sensitivity obtained using NP specimens was significantly higher than that obtained using NS specimens only for RSV.",PMC2546706,PMC2546706_3
"The study found that the number of columnar and squamous cells in the specimens had no association with positive virus identification, indicating that the number of cells in these specimens had most likely reached the threshold for all three virology tests.",PMC2546706,PMC2546706_4
