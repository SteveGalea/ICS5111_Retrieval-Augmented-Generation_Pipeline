"The study found that mice lacking CD4+ T cells had less severe central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and demyelination following infection with the CNS-tropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) than wild-type controls. This suggests a central role for CD4+ T cells in the early stages of CNS disease following viral infection in the amplification of inflammation and, ultimately, demyelination by promoting the entry of macrophages into the CNS.",PMC111476,PMC111476_0
"The study identified rantes as a chemokine that plays a prominent role in both regulating leukocyte entry into the CNS and contributing to the pathogenesis of MHV-induced CNS inflammation and demyelination. Rantes expression is compromised in CD4-deficient mice, resulting in lower levels of mRNA transcripts and protein than in CD8-deficient and wild-type mice. This decrease in rantes levels correlates with the reduced severity of macrophage infiltration and demyelination in the CNS of CD4-deficient mice.",PMC111476,PMC111476_1
"The study found that mice treated with neutralizing anti-rantes antibodies had delayed viral clearance from the CNS and decreased cellular infiltration, similar to the phenotype observed in CD4-deficient mice. This supports the argument that targeting chemokines may be a novel therapeutic intervention strategy to treat human CNS inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS).",PMC111476,PMC111476_2
"The study suggests that rantes exerts a potent chemotactic effect on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as macrophages, and its expression is compromised in CD4-deficient mice, resulting in lower levels of mRNA transcripts and protein than in CD8-deficient and wild-type mice. This decrease in rantes levels correlates with the reduced severity of macrophage infiltration and demyelination in the CNS of CD4-deficient mice.",PMC111476,PMC111476_3
"The study supports and extends earlier studies that have suggested that targeting chemokines may be a novel therapeutic intervention strategy to treat human CNS inflammatory diseases, including MS. Rantes expression",PMC111476,PMC111476_4
