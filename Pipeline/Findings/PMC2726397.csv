"A high frequency of threonine (Thr) residues in secreted and membrane proteins, which are N-glycosylated, is a characteristic feature of eukaryotes with N-glycan-dependent quality control (QC) of protein folding. This selection for Thr is also observed in viral envelope proteins, which have high sequon densities due to the addition of N-linked glycans.",PMC2726397,PMC2726397_0
"The increased likelihood that asparagine (Asn), threonine (Thr), and serine (Ser) will be present in sequons rather than elsewhere in secreted and membrane proteins is a mechanism for selecting sequons in eukaryotes with N-glycan-dependent QC of protein folding. This selection for sequons results in an increase in the actual density of sequons compared to the expected density based on the frequencies of Asn, Thr, and Ser in the set of secreted proteins for each organism.",PMC2726397,PMC2726397_1
"The low-complexity regions in proteins, which cause misleading amino acid frequencies, are excluded from analyses to accurately predict N-glycan length and N-glycan-associated QC of protein folding.",PMC2726397,PMC2726397_2
"The statistical significance of the difference between the actual and expected sequon densities for each organism is determined using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, and differences between sequon densities of secreted proteins and cytosolic proteins are compared for each organism to distinguish eukaryotes with N-glycan-dependent QC from eukaryotes without N-glycan-dependent QC of protein folding.",PMC2726397,PMC2726397_3
"The absence of N-glycans is predicted when there are no N-linked glycosyltransferases and no ost present in certain schizosaccharomyces proteins, which are used to infer the presence of an N-glycan-associated QC system for protein folding. This prediction is made by probing with PSI-BLAST the proteins of each organism with the N-linked glycosyltransferases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",PMC2726397,PMC2726397_4
