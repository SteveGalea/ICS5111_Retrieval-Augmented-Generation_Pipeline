The burden of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is underestimated due to gross under-reporting and neglect by the global health community.,PMC2865085,PMC2865085_0
"Many NTDs have a biology that is inherently different from that of malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and HIV/AIDS, with long reproductive lifespans of causative organisms or vectors, slow-growing parasites, and little capacity for change.",PMC2865085,PMC2865085_1
"Controlling NTDs can be achieved through simple and cheap interventions, such as the use of existing drugs, mass drug administration, and improved hygiene behavior, integrated with animal health services.",PMC2865085,PMC2865085_2
"Integrated control of NTDs in humans and animals can lead to sustainable reductions in transmission, as demonstrated by successful partnerships and advocacy for NTDs.",PMC2865085,PMC2865085_3
"The availability of cheap and effective diagnostics is crucial for improving surveillance and monitoring of NTDs, as demonstrated by successes in controlling ""worms"" and sleeping sickness in mexico and sub-Saharan Africa, respectively.",PMC2865085,PMC2865085_4
"Elimination strategies for NTDs should be approached with caution, as they may encourage donors to invest in elimination programs at the expense of under-resourced control efforts, and the perceived benefit of eradication depends on the extent to which the flies either upset, or appear to protect, the distinctive type of land use beloved by each lobby.",PMC2865085,PMC2865085_5
"The perceived benefit of eradicating NTDs also depends on the type of interest groups involved and the preferred control technique, as well as the affordability of such strategies.",PMC2865085,PMC2865085_6
"The power of different interest groups involved in the debate between control and elimination strategies also reflects the perceived benefit of these strategies, as the people and institutions that recommend attacking the fly often prefer the particular control technique that they themselves have developed or refined.",PMC2865085,PMC2865085_7
"The poor farmer, at risk from disease and loss of livelihood, is rarely involved in this debate.",PMC2865085,PMC2865085_8
The successes in controlling NTDs are found more frequently in public health than in other sectors and suggest that this is due to the immediate feedback that health programme beneficiaries give to programme workers.,PMC2865085,PMC2865085_9
"Development economists argue that every child has a right to a life free from hunger disease and suffering, and that dealing with the neglected diseases is no exception.",PMC2865085,PMC2865085_10
