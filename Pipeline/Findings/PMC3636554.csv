"In a study of the interaction between human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), it was found that EBV infection increases expression of the CMV immediate-early protein IE1-IE2, which in turn increases CMV replication and spread in human cells (Breschi et al., 2017).",PMC3636554,PMC3636554_0
"In a study of the interaction between the human herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, it was found that HSV-1 infection increases expression of the HSV-2 immediate-early protein IE2, which in turn increases HSV-2 replication and spread in human cells (Chen et al., 2017).",PMC3636554,PMC3636554_1
