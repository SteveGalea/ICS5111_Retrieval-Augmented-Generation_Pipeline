The study identified that human parechovirus type 3 (hpev3) causes a more severe clinical presentation than hpev1 due to the over-representation of transcripts associated with immune and inflammatory responses following hpev3 infection.,PMC6119779,PMC6119779_0
The study showed that hpev1 and hpev3 infect the human airway epithelium in a polarized manner by targeting the basal progenitor cells.,PMC6119779,PMC6119779_1
"The study revealed that hpev3, the genotype causing outbreaks of severe illness in neonates, induces an amplified immune and inflammatory host response when compared to hpev1.",PMC6119779,PMC6119779_2
"The study demonstrated that the human airway epithelial cell line, HaCaT, is permissive to hpev infection and that hpev1 and hpev3 infect it in a polarized manner by targeting the basal progenitor cells.",PMC6119779,PMC6119779_3
"The study found that hpev3, the genotype causing outbreaks of severe illness in neonates, exhibited an over-representation of transcripts associated with immune and inflammatory responses following infection compared to hpev1.",PMC6119779,PMC6119779_4
