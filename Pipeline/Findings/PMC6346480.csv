"A study in Brazil detected influenza A(H18N11) virus in two Artibeus lituratus bats in 2012, with close genetic relatedness to a strain found in Peru in 2010. The low detection rate of 0.4% in this study is not consistent with previous studies and may suggest seasonal variation in bat influenza virus infections.",PMC6346480,PMC6346480_0
"High concentrations of the virus in intestinal specimens suggest intestinal tropism and potential fecal shedding into the environment. The viral genome sequences showed high sequence identity between the Brazil and Peru strains, with amino acid exchanges in polymerase basic 1 and nucleoprotein genes.",PMC6346480,PMC6346480_1
"Thermodynamic modeling revealed preservation of critical amino acid residues associated with influenza A virus replication and entry, with no amino acid exchanges in the putative receptor binding site or active site of the viral glycoproteins. This suggests broadly conserved cellular receptor and biologic activity in different bat species.",PMC6346480,PMC6346480_2
Significantly fewer amino acid exchanges were observed between the ha (hemagglutinin) proteins of bat influenza A virus variants than between the respective nl (neuraminidase-like) proteins. This finding may suggest comparable evolutionary dynamics between chiropteran and avian reservoirs.,PMC6346480,PMC6346480_3
"The distribution of Artibeus lituratus and Artibeus planirostris bats, in which H18N11 was originally detected in Peru, overlaps, potentially facilitating virus exchange across the populations. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed close genetic relationship between Peru and Brazil H18N11 variants across all eight segments, suggesting lack of reassortment events.",PMC6346480,PMC6346480_4
