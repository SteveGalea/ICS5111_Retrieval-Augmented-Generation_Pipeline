"The study estimated that the mean incubation period for human avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infections in China during 2013-2014 was approximately 3.4 days, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.9 to 3.7 days.",PMC4597801,PMC4597801_0
"The study found that all of the 2-parameter distributions (gamma, weibull, lognormal, exponential, and log-logistic) provided reasonable fits in comparison with the nonparametric estimate of the incubation period distribution, with the best-fitting parametric distribution being the weibull distribution.",PMC4597801,PMC4597801_1
"The study compared published estimates of the incubation period distribution and found generally higher estimates from studies that used the midpoint approximation, compared with other studies based on restricted sample sizes or single exposure data.",PMC4597801,PMC4597801_2
"The study showed that the incubation period estimates were consistent with smaller-sample-size studies based on parametric methods with interval exposure data, as well as with estimates based on inference from ecological data.",PMC4597801,PMC4597801_3
"The study recommended a 7-day observation period for exposed persons, as 97% and 99% of cases, respectively, would show symptoms within those periods.",PMC4597801,PMC4597801_4
