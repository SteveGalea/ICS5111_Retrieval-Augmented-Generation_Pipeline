"In order to accurately predict the potential for disease spread in livestock, it may not be necessary to collect data on all livestock farms, but only those that contribute most significantly to the livestock trade. This method, called targeted movement sampling, involves recording movements only from the most highly connected farms. It was found to be less effective than using data from all farms, but it may be more practical to implement as it does not require prior knowledge of the relative connectivity of the farms in the network.",PMC4455802,PMC4455802_0
"When within-market transmission occurs, less than 20% of all farms would need to be surveyed in order to accurately predict epidemic sizes for outbreaks seeded in cumbria, devon, and aberdeenshire. The model also gives a very good approximation of the spatial spread of the disease, the size of the epidemic peak, and the epidemic duration.",PMC4455802,PMC4455802_1
"The role played by markets in disease transmission may have a significant effect upon the predictability of the sampling methods. When markets do not contribute to disease transmission, only a very small percentage of nodes would need to be sampled using the targeted network sampling method. However, when markets are explicitly included in the model, assuming that all batches on a market are well mixed, a much larger proportion of the nodes must be sampled.",PMC4455802,PMC4455802_2
"The model presented in this paper uses a weighted static network to simulate the risk of transmission between livestock farms. Weighted static networks are regularly used in livestock disease models, but they may potentially underestimate variability when compared with results on dynamic networks. Future studies will focus upon constructing a dynamic network and testing network sampling schemes and temporal sampling schemes (whereby sampling is targeted based on time of year) on their ability to predict epidemic behavior.",PMC4455802,PMC4455802_3
"The model framework described here would not be appropriate for a disease of the nature of bovine tuberculosis (BTB), where it may be crucial to track movements of individual cattle. This is because animals infected with BTB can remain asymptomatic carriers for several months before becoming infectious. The model presented in this paper assumes that infected movements result in all livestock on the destination farm becoming rapidly infected, which is not the case for all livestock diseases. Future work will focus upon the development of optimal sampling strategies for slow-spreading diseases such as BTB, where it may be crucial to track movements",PMC4455802,PMC4455802_4
