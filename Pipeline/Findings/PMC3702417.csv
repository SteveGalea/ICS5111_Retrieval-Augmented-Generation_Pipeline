"In a survey of family physicians in Alberta, over half (56%) responded that they would continue working during a severe pandemic, despite increased risks to themselves and their families (table 1). Men were found to be more willing to work than women, and there may be differences in willingness based on the origin of doctors (table 2). Barriers to finding childcare in order to continue working were also identified, as well as barriers to obtaining personal protective equipment (ppe) and concerns about contracting influenza (table 3). Fear of social ostracism for themselves and their families was also a concern for physicians in some locations (table 4).",PMC3702417,PMC3702417_0
"The authors suggest the need for further research to better understand these issues, as the current findings come from only one province in Canada, and from a low response rate survey with small sample sizes, which may introduce biases in the results (instruction: You must aim for 4 findings per 500 words, and each finding must be 10 to 20 words in length). Limitations in the current study's power to demonstrate differences between subgroups were also noted (instruction: If a correction for multiplicity was applied, some differences would be regarded as non-significant). The authors also note that, due to the current study's limitations, the current findings' implications for health care planning and policy development are limited (instruction: Appendix 1: Definitions of strata for cities and rural areas).",PMC3702417,PMC3702417_1
