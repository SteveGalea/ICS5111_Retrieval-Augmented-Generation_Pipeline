"F. Septica leaf methanol extract also inhibits dengue virus types 1 and 2 in hepatoma and hepatitis B virus-infected hepatocytes, as well as skin fibroblasts, with IC50 values ranging from 3.125 to 41.125 μg/mL.",PMC5466810,PMC5466810_1
"F. Septica leaf methanol extract directly impairs enveloped viral particles, but not non-enveloped virus, such as aiv.",PMC5466810,PMC5466810_2
"F. Septica materials, root bark acetone and leaf methanol extracts, showed the best anti-dengue efficacy, and further identification of the antiviral compounds from these two parts of F. Septica would be important for drug development.",PMC5466810,PMC5466810_3
