"The capripox virus lamp assay has a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of caprine arthritis and encephalitis (CAEV) viruses, with a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity similar to that of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and a lower sensitivity than virus isolation but a higher sensitivity than virus isolation.",PMC3347125,PMC3347125_0
"The lamp assay has a lower limit of detection (LOD) for CAEV viruses in clinical samples from infected animals, with an LOD of 10 to 100 copies per reaction for swabs, blood, and tissues from infected sheep, goats, and cattle, compared to a lower LOD for qPCR but a higher LOD for virus isolation.",PMC3347125,PMC3347125_1
"The lamp assay allows for early detection of CAEV viruses, with a time to early detection of 2 days postinfection with swabs from infected sheep and goats and 6 days postinfection in blood and tissues from infected sheep, goats, and cattle, compared to a time to early detection of 2 days postinfection with swabs from sheep infected with an spv and weak early detection of lsdv in infected cattle, which is likely due to the longer incubation times for lsdv to result in infection and clinical signs.",PMC3347125,PMC3347125_2
"The lamp assay can be performed under isothermal conditions using simple laboratory equipment, such as a water bath or heating block, and it is highly specific, as it uses up to six target-specific primers that recognize eight distinct regions on the target template, with a higher sensitivity of detection of CAEV viruses in real time when the reactions are performed on a 96-well plate in an incubator equipped with a plate reader.",PMC3347125,PMC3347125_3
"The lamp assay is emerging as a promising new method due to its low cost, ease of operation, and high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of various pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, amoebae, and fungi, as it is tolerant against naturally occurring inhibitors in biological samples and has a lower limit of detection for CAEV viruses in clinical samples from infected animals than virus isolation but a higher limit of detection than qPCR.",PMC3347125,PMC3347125_4
