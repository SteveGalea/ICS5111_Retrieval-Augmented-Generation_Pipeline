"The authors have developed a novel nucleic acid signal detection system based on the cleavage of a phosphodiester linkage in a dual-dye-labeled oligonucleotide probe by the endo IV enzyme from E. Coli. This system requires a fluorophore attached through a rigid linker to the oligonucleotide and a helper oligonucleotide, as well as a relatively rigid linker in the probe substrate to convey the exquisite specificity of endo IV cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage.",PMC1636472,PMC1636472_0
"The authors have optimized the parameters influencing the activity of the endo IV enzyme, including the temperature, the linker structure, the probe length, and the concentration of the enzyme, enhancer, and target sequences. The use of a rigid linker and short probes (10mer to 12mer) contributes to the improved mismatch discrimination and specificity of endo IV cleavage.",PMC1636472,PMC1636472_1
"The authors have disclosed the synthesis of fluorophore analogs coupled to a rigid linker and solid support, used in the synthesis of labeled oligonucleotides for the probes.",PMC1636472,PMC1636472_2
"The authors have demonstrated the combination of the endo IV assay with a PCR as a post-amplification detection system, which allows for clear allele differentiation due to the excellent spacing of scatter plot endpoint signals of no template controls, wild-type, mutant, and heterozygous samples, unlike other endpoint genotyping methods, which may suffer from overlapping endpoint signals due to PCR efficiency issues.",PMC1636472,PMC1636472_3
"The authors have successfully used the endo IV post-PCR genotyping system for >5,000 genotype assays in an industry setting.",PMC1636472,PMC1636472_4
"The use of the endo IV assay in genotyping assays allows for flexibility in probe design due to the ability to put the mismatch in any one of positions 1-6, contributing to the improved mismatch discrimination.",PMC1636472,PMC1636472_5
"The endo IV post-PCR genotyping system allows for the use of probes shorter than those typically used in other methods, contributing to improved mismatch discrimination and specificity of endo IV cleavage.",PMC1636472,PMC1636472_6
