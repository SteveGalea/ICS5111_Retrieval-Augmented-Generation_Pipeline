"The study provides a temporal description of the patterns of dengue virus spread in Asia, revealing that dengue virus genetic diversity in Asia is dynamic yet spatially structured, with frequent virus lineage movement among countries and frequent co-circulation of dengue virus lineages.",PMC5542384,PMC5542384_0
"The analysis suggests that the air transportation network has contributed to the spatial dissemination of dengue virus in Asia, with large transportation hubs accounting for most of the inferred virus lineage movements within their respective networks.",PMC5542384,PMC5542384_1
"The study suggests that some countries, such as Thailand and India, seem to act as central hubs of dengue lineage movement in Asia, demonstrating both inward/outward viral migrations with other countries in the region.",PMC5542384,PMC5542384_2
"The study suggests that some countries, such as Vietnam and Malaysia, may have had an increasing role in dengue spread through time, with differences in the roles of air transport nodes in regional-scale dissemination of dengue virus.",PMC5542384,PMC5542384_3
"The study highlights the importance of developing a multivalent dengue vaccine in order to cope with increasing frequency of dengue serotype co-occurrence, as the potential impacts of vaccination on dengue epidemics in Asia should be considered, especially for countries in the tropics.",PMC5542384,PMC5542384_4
