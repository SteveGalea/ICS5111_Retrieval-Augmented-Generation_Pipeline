"In the context of the mouse model for cytokine production and antibody responses, a new flagellin derivative, kfd-p24 3d, was generated by inserting hypervariable region-deleted fragments into the middle of (nhei and bamhi enzyme-digested) the plasmid kfd3 (table 1). This derivative was shown to have a lower level of flagellin-specific antibody production compared to the parent flagellin, kfd-p24 (figure 1B).",PMC3899144,PMC3899144_0
"In the context of the purification of recombinant proteins, the purified proteins were tested using ntb and bcip (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) for the detection of co-stimulatory molecules, with spots digitized into pixel densities (pds) that were exported into an Excel program for analysis (figure 1B).",PMC3899144,PMC3899144_1
"In the context of the mouse model for cytokine production and antibody responses, the response of splenocytes to flagellin was analyzed using apc-labeled anti-CD11c, fitc-labeled anti-CD86, pe-labeled anti-CD80, and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-aad) (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) for the detection of co-stimulatory molecules (figure 3).",PMC3899144,PMC3899144_2
"In the context of the mouse model for cytokine production and antibody responses, the il-6 and TNF-α in serum samples were quantified using elisa kits (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) 24 hours after intranasal administration of a 250 µg stimulus in 25 µl PBS or after intraperitoneal injection of a 250 µg stimulus in 250 µl PBS on 6-8 weeks old C57BL/6 mice (figure 2B).",PMC3899144,PMC3899144_3
"In the context of the mouse model for cytokine production and antibody responses, the concentration of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured in",PMC3899144,PMC3899144_4
