"In a study on dengue fever in children in Myanmar, the prevalence of g6pd deficiency was lower than in a previous study in the same setting, possibly due to differences in the cut-off level for g6pd activity.",PMC6314580,PMC6314580_0
"The study did not find an association between g6pd deficiency and dengue severity, although some previous studies have suggested that g6pd-deficient individuals may be more susceptible to dengue infection and have higher replication of the virus.",PMC6314580,PMC6314580_1
"The study found that young age is a risk factor significantly associated with severe dengue infection, and that warning signs such as hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, and lethargy were more frequently present in severe dengue patients.",PMC6314580,PMC6314580_2
"The study confirmed that the 2009 WHO classification for dengue can be applied to detect severe dengue infection in children in Myanmar, as patients with severe dengue had significantly higher haematocrit and lower platelet count than those with non-severe dengue.",PMC6314580,PMC6314580_3
"The study proposed activity cut-off points of enzyme activity according to the WHO classification, as well as the prevalence of g6pd deficient and the predominant genetic mutation among paediatric dengue patients in Myanmar.",PMC6314580,PMC6314580_4
