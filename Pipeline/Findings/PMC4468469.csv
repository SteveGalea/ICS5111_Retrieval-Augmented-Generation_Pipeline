A study found that antibodies specific to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 non-neutralizing region (nhr) gained neutralizing activity against HIV-1 env-mediated membrane fusion and infection when used in combination with the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (TID: S10-6785).,PMC4468469,PMC4468469_0
"The study showed that anti-gp41 nhr antibodies, when combined with enfuvirtide, exhibited a very strong synergistic antiviral effect against laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains, including drug-resistant variants, and primary HIV-1 isolates with different subtypes circulating in the world (TID: S10-6785).",PMC4468469,PMC4468469_1
"The study found that binding of enfuvirtide to the gp41 nhr domain may significantly prolong the lifetime of the gp41 prehairpin intermediate and extend its temporal window, thus providing sufficient time for the gp41 nhr-specific antibodies to bind with the viral gp41 nhr domain to block virus-cell fusion (TID: S10-6785).",PMC4468469,PMC4468469_2
The study suggested that antigens derived from the HIV-1 gp41 nhr domain have potential for development as therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of HIV-1 infection when used in combination with HIV fusion inhibitors such as enfuvirtide (TID: S10-6785).,PMC4468469,PMC4468469_3
"The study found that, in the presence of enfuvirtide, non-neutralizing antibodies specific to the gp41 nhr domain gained neutralizing activity against HIV-1 env-mediated membrane fusion and infection by both laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains, including drug-resistant variants, and primary HIV-1 isolates with different subtypes circulating in the world (TID: S10-6785).",PMC4468469,PMC4468469_4
