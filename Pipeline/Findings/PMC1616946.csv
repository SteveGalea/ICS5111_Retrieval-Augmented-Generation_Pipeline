"Antisense oligonucleotides can induce high-level frameshifting, with az1a, which anneals directly adjacent to the uga stop codon, being able to induce ribosome frameshifts to either the +1 or −1 reading frame.",PMC1616946,PMC1616946_0
"The ability of antisense oligonucleotides to induce frameshifting is not dependent on the presence of elaborate tertiary structures, as structural studies indicate that antisense–mrna duplexes formed by complementary antisense oligonucleotides are sufficient to induce high-level frameshifting.",PMC1616946,PMC1616946_1
The ability of spermidine to stimulate antisense oligonucleotide induced ribosome frameshifting to the +1 reading frame at the ucc uga shift site in the absence of the natural 3′ stimulator demonstrates that this cis-acting element is not required for polyamine responsiveness.,PMC1616946,PMC1616946_2
"The observation that az1a, which anneals directly adjacent to the uga stop codon, can induce ribosome frameshifts to either the +1 or −1 reading frame is surprising, as visual examination of upstream codons does not reveal an obvious −1 or +1 frameshift site.",PMC1616946,PMC1616946_3
"The ability to direct ribosomes to the +1 reading frame in living cells suggests a potential therapeutic application for antisense oligonucleotides, as directed frameshifting to the +1 reading frame near a disease causing −1 frameshift mutation would cause some ribosomes to resume decoding in the wild-type orf, thus restoring partial production of full-length protein from mutant alleles.",PMC1616946,PMC1616946_4
