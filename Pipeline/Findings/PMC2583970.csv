A study on cotton blue disease in Brazil identified three divergent isolates associated with atypical symptoms. These isolates have a coat protein similar to clrdv but distinct rdrp sequences and probably arose from recombination events between clrdv and an unidentified luteovirus. Molecular taxonomic criteria for the luteoviridae suggest that these isolates represent a new species in the genus polerovirus.,PMC2583970,PMC2583970_0
"The study found that clrdv has a widespread distribution in Brazilian states, with a low genetic diversity between the 23 samples analyzed.",PMC2583970,PMC2583970_1
The analyses revealed that recombination events between clrdv and an unidentified luteovirus probably occurred in the three divergent isolates associated with atypical cbd symptoms.,PMC2583970,PMC2583970_2
"A phylogenetic analysis of the partial rdrp sequence and the coat protein (cp) region showed that the three divergent isolates share identities of approximately 70% and 97% with the corresponding sequences from the 20 analyzed clrdv isolates, respectively.",PMC2583970,PMC2583970_3
"The study suggests that the three divergent isolates should be considered as isolates of a new species in the genus polerovirus, in agreement with molecular taxonomic criteria for the luteoviridae family.",PMC2583970,PMC2583970_4
