"In a cross-sectional study of 522 qualified nurses in London, the seasonal influenza vaccination rate was 37%, higher than previous reports in healthcare workers (ranging from 14.3% to 26.4%) and similar to a reported vaccination coverage of 16% in nurses in elderly care units. This suggests that increased risk perception due to the 2009 influenza pandemic may have contributed to the higher vaccination rate.",PMC3405768,PMC3405768_0
"A lack of knowledge about influenza and vaccination was a strong predictor of nurses' vaccination behaviors, especially for those never vaccinated. This cluster had the lowest knowledge score and suggests that increasing their knowledge might improve their vaccination behaviors.",PMC3405768,PMC3405768_1
"Between those occasionally vaccinated and continuously vaccinated, knowledge levels were not significantly different, but the newly vaccinated in 2009 had on average higher knowledge scores than those continuously vaccinated. This may reflect an increase in their risk perceptions towards influenza due to widespread reporting of the risks in the media encouraging them to be vaccinated for the first time in their lives.",PMC3405768,PMC3405768_2
"Concerns about the vaccine's side-effects and effectiveness or safety were the two most frequent reasons for not having a vaccination, indicating continuing misconceptions about influenza vaccine in nurses. Unvaccinated nurses also reported 'no need' as their reason not having a vaccination, consistent with their low-risk perception of contracting influenza.",PMC3405768,PMC3405768_3
"The perception of personal vulnerability to illness was important in nurses making vaccination decisions, but concerns about the negative personal consequences of contracting influenza and its sequelae, rather than nurses' professional duty to protect patients or other vulnerable groups, were the focus of nurses' reasons for having vaccination. Future educational campaigns may wish to consider providing targeted information to change these widespread myths in nurses.",PMC3405768,PMC3405768_4
