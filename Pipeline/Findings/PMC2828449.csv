"The study reports a prevalence study of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in Malaysia. Out of 28 suspected FIP cats, 25 (89%) were confirmed positive for feline coronavirus (FCoV) using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).",PMC2828449,PMC2828449_0
"The study found that FIP-positivity rate in cats younger than 2 years old was higher (64%) than in older cats, but this result is not statistically significant. Most (80%) of the FCOV-positive cats were males.",PMC2828449,PMC2828449_1
"The study found that the majority (96%) of FIP-suspected cats diagnosed with FIP were domestic short hair (dSH) or Persian cats. This finding is consistent with a previous report on FIP in Malaysia, showing that 96.7% and 27.3% of cats diagnosed with FIP were dSH and Persian cats, respectively.",PMC2828449,PMC2828449_2
"The study found that all 10 local FCOV isolates showed a high homology (96%) with published FCOV sequences, indicating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and deletions in the sequences of FCOV isolates from Malaysia, as well as from other geographic origins, such as the United States, the Netherlands, and Taiwan.",PMC2828449,PMC2828449_3
"The study found that the sequences of FCOV isolates from Malaysia showed a higher homology (96%) between themselves compared to published FCOV sequences from other geographic origins, such as the United States, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.",PMC2828449,PMC2828449_4
"The study found that the sequences of FCOV isolates from Malaysia showed point mutations and single-nucleotide deletions in the sequences of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of FCOV. These findings support previous observations of SNPs in FCOV sequences, as described previously.",PMC2828449,PMC2828449_5
"The study found that the sequences of FCOV isolates from Malaysia fell into one main cluster, with all local sequences falling into one distinct cluster, as shown in the phylogenetic tree constructed using the neighbor-joining method.",PMC2828449,PMC2828449_6
The study found that the sequences of the primers used in the RT-PCR assay were removed from the alignment and phylogen,PMC2828449,PMC2828449_7
