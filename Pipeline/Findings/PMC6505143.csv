"The study identified four de novo private deletions in the newly sequenced cc strains, including one on the x chromosome in cc079/tauunc.",PMC6505143,PMC6505143_0
The study estimated current levels of heterozygosity in the cc population and found that three years separate sequenced samples from the colony survey.,PMC6505143,PMC6505143_1
"The study identified three distinct resources to describe the genomes of the cc, including genotype and haplotype reconstructions for the mrcas of each cc strain, whole genome sequence from a single male for 75 cc strains, and a colony survey of 72 cc strains using a set of markers.",PMC6505143,PMC6505143_2
"The study found that for 51 strains, the sequenced cc sample underestimated residual heterozygosity compared to the three more recent samples genotyped in minimuga, and recommended that users of the cc preserve tissue samples from all cc mice used in an experiment.",PMC6505143,PMC6505143_3
The study highlighted the level and potential effects of residual heterozygosity in many of the cc strains and recommended regular and comprehensive updates on the heterozygosity still remaining within the sgcfâ€™s colony of cc mice over time.,PMC6505143,PMC6505143_4
