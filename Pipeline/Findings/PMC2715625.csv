"Chloroquine shows strong in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities against hcov-oc43, with an ec50 of 0.306 μm and a selectivity index of 1,369 in vitro, and a survival rate of 69.0% in newborn mice treated with chloroquine via maternal milk.",PMC2715625,PMC2715625_0
"Chloroquine is required at the moment of infection to block hcov-oc43 replication, as seen in time-of-addition experiments in vitro, where chloroquine reduced the viral load by 2 logs in comparison to the positive control value, but at later time points, a loss of antiviral activity was noted.",PMC2715625,PMC2715625_1
"The survival rate of newborn mice that received chloroquine only transplacentally was 0%, possibly due to an ineffectively low concentration of chloroquine reached in the newborn mice, as chloroquine accumulates in tissue and organs of the mother and the fetus, resulting in high chloroquine concentrations in maternal milk.",PMC2715625,PMC2715625_2
"Treatment with daily doses of chloroquine has a long-lasting protective effect against lethal coronavirus oc43 infection in newborn mice, with a survival rate of 69.0% in newborn mice treated with chloroquine via maternal milk, which is lower than the survival rate of newborn mice whose mothers received chloroquine postpartum.",PMC2715625,PMC2715625_3
"Chloroquine is more potent in inhibiting hcov-oc43 replication than in inhibiting sars-cov replication, as seen in in vitro studies, where the ec50 of chloroquine against hcov-oc43 was 0.306 μm, while the ec50 against sars-cov was 8.8 μm.",PMC2715625,PMC2715625_4
