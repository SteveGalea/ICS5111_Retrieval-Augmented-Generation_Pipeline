"The study evaluated the kinetics of inactivation of bacillus subtilis subsp. Niger spores and Salmonella typhimurium by chlorine dioxide (CIO2) gas using a mathematical model. The findings showed that the survival curves exhibited a nonlinear behavior, with a downward concavity (shoulder) for b. Subtilis subsp. Niger spores and an upward concavity (tailing) for S. Typhimurium. This suggests that spores are more resistant to CIO2 than vegetative bacteria during the early phase of inactivation.",PMC4959078,PMC4959078_0
"The study also found that the inactivation efficiency of CIO2 gas was higher under conditions of high relative humidity (RH), with a more rapid improvement in inactivation efficiency at RH values above 70%. This is attributed to the fact that water vapor condenses onto the surface of the organism, acting as a carrier for CIO2 gas, and swelling of spores increases the diameter of the channel for access of gases into spores, expanding the spore coat to improve penetrability.",PMC4959078,PMC4959078_1
"The study established a mathematical model, the Weibull-h model, to reveal the tendencies and kinetics of inactivation by CIO2 gas under different RH conditions. The model produced a better fit to the survival curve than the first-order model under different concentrations of CIO2 gas.",PMC4959078,PMC4959078_2
The study calculated the time required to achieve a six-log reduction based on the established models. The findings showed that b. Subtilis subsp. Niger spores were more resistant to CIO2 gas and required longer treatment times for effective inactivation than Salmonella typhimurium.,PMC4959078,PMC4959078_3
The study's findings will be useful for clarifying the effective conditions for CIO2 gas required to inactivate airborne pathogens in contaminated air and other environments.,PMC4959078,PMC4959078_4
