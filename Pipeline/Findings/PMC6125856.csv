"The prevalence of feline leukaemia virus (felv) and feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv) in New Zealand is higher than previously reported, likely due to the high index of suspicion for disease in the population studied, as well as the possibility of false-positive reactions on fiv antibody tests in cats previously vaccinated against fiv.",PMC6125856,PMC6125856_0
"Cats with high-risk lifestyles, such as those with a history of bite wounds or exposure to infected cats, have a higher occurrence of felv and fiv.",PMC6125856,PMC6125856_1
"Males are at a significantly increased risk of testing positive for felv and fiv, potentially due to their more aggressive behavior and increased risk of bite wounds.",PMC6125856,PMC6125856_2
"The survival times for felv- and fiv-positive cats are significantly lower than in other studies, potentially due to differences in transmission dynamics and the poor clinical prognosis associated with advanced stages of retroviral disease.",PMC6125856,PMC6125856_3
"The occurrence of felv test positivity in New Zealand is marginally greater than expected, possibly due to regional differences in felv epidemiology and the fact that only a small proportion of client-owned cats are tested for felv, despite guidelines recommending routine screening for felv and fiv in cats with high-risk lifestyles or compatible clinical signs.",PMC6125856,PMC6125856_4
