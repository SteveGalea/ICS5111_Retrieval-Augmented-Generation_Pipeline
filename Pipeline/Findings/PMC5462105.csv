"In a study of 120 patients with asthma, the authors found that both sputum eosinophils and fevorip metered dose (Fev1) were negatively associated with rhinovirus-induced exacerbations.",PMC5462105,PMC5462105_0
"The study also reported that patients infected with rhinovirus subgroup C (RV-C) had higher blood eosinophils at exacerbation than patients infected with RV-A, but this finding should be interpreted with caution as no other type 2 markers were increased.",PMC5462105,PMC5462105_1
"The authors measured the mRNA expression of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TS LP) in sputum and found that patients with high sputum TSLP had lower sputum eosinophils, lower Fev1, and higher %Fev1 at exacerbation than patients with low sputum TSLP, suggesting that TSLP does not promote type 2 inflammation in the airways during virus-induced exacerbations of asthma.",PMC5462105,PMC5462105_2
The study found no difference in clinical measurements or sputum inflammatory phenotype between patients infected with RV-C and RV-A.,PMC5462105,PMC5462105_3
"The authors noted that patients with RV-C comprised 30% of all rhinovirus infections, a proportion similar to that reported in a previous study, but they did not find any difference in sputum inflammatory phenotype or other type 2 markers between patients with RV-C and RV-A.",PMC5462105,PMC5462105_4
"In a subgroup analysis, the authors found that participants with high sputum TSLP had lower sputum eosinophils, lower Fev1, and higher %Fev1 at exacerbation than participants with low sputum TSLP, suggesting that other pathways (including epithelial cytokines such as IL-33) might be responsible for driving innate pathways leading to type 2 inflammation in acute virus-induced asthma.",PMC5462105,PMC5462105_5
"The authors also found that patients infected with RV-C had higher blood eosinophils at exacerbation than patients infected with RV-A, but this finding should be interpreted with caution as no other type",PMC5462105,PMC5462105_6
