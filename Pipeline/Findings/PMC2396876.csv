"UsPA1(527–665), a protein isolated from the bacterium Methanobrevibacterium catarrhalis, has been structurally and functionally characterized. Its crystal structure reveals a unique coiled-coil structure composed of three left-handed helices. This structure allows UsPA1(527–665) to bind to n-ceacam1, a bacterial adhesin, forming a complex that is critical for bacterial colonization of host cells.",PMC2396876,PMC2396876_0
"UsPA1(527–665) is also involved in blocking the binding of n-ceacam1 to its receptor, thus preventing bacterial adhesion to host cells. This finding has important implications for developing strategies to combat bacterial infections.",PMC2396876,PMC2396876_1
"Electron microscopy studies have shown that UsPA1(527–665) adopts a distinctly bowed structure when it binds to n-ceacam1. This structure allows UsPA1(527–665) to disrupt the homo-dimeric form of n-ceacam1, preventing bacterial adhesion to host cells.",PMC2396876,PMC2396876_2
"Auc sedimentation equilibrium experiments have revealed that UsPA1(527–665) binds to n-ceacam1 with a dissociation constant of 12 nM, and this binding is critical for bacterial colonization of host cells.",PMC2396876,PMC2396876_3
"Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that UsPA1(527–665) undergoes a conformational change when it binds to n-ceacam1, which allows it to disrupt the homo-dimeric form of n-ceacam1 and prevent bacterial adhesion to host cells. This finding has important implications for developing strategies to combat bacterial infections.",PMC2396876,PMC2396876_4
