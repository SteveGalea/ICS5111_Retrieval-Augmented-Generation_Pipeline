"The new multiplex PCR-based microarray, rpm-ivdc1, allows for the simultaneous detection and characterization of multiple respiratory tract viral pathogens, including atypical viruses such as measles, rubella, and influenza type C, with improved analytical sensitivity compared to conventional detection methods.",PMC3785410,PMC3785410_0
"The new microarray design, with shorter detector tiles and a smaller number of tiles, increases hybridization efficiency and allows for strain-level identification of some pathogens, such as human metapneumovirus and coronavirus, while still providing type- or strain-level identification for common respiratory pathogens.",PMC3785410,PMC3785410_1
"The use of multiple conserved primer pairs targeting specific pathogens in the microarray primer mix, in combination with the high efficiency of the assay, enables improved detection of respiratory tract viral pathogens, particularly for respiratory syncytial virus, where only 5 of the 22 infections identified by the rpm method were detected by the reference assay.",PMC3785410,PMC3785410_2
The results of this study demonstrate the potential for diagnosing infectious syndromes manifesting by similar symptoms caused by diverse etiological agents and the capability of rpm-ivdc1 for improving response capacity to epidemic outbreak and epidemic surveillance.,PMC3785410,PMC3785410_3
"However, the false-negative detection for respiratory syncytial virus should be addressed prior to clinical adoption, and further validation is required for the simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory tract viral pathogens using rpm-ivdc1 in the context of outbreak investigations or epidemic surveillance.",PMC3785410,PMC3785410_4
