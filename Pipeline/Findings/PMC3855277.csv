"This study provides the first evidence of the circulation of canine norovirus (cnv) in the UK dog population, confirming its presence through the detection of cnv-specific antibodies in dogs.",PMC3855277,PMC3855277_0
"The study found that cnv seroprevalence has significantly increased over the past decade in the UK dog population, with 60.1% of dogs in the 2012-2013 cohort seropositive compared to 38.1% in the 1999-2001 cohort.",PMC3855277,PMC3855277_1
"The study identified variation in seroprevalence between the three cnv strains studied, with the highest seroprevalence in both cohorts demonstrated for cnv strain HK.",PMC3855277,PMC3855277_2
"The study revealed that cnv isolation from stool samples using qPCR is more likely in a younger cohort of dogs, as seroprevalence increases significantly in older dogs.",PMC3855277,PMC3855277_3
"The study suggested that at least three antigenically distinct cnv strains have been circulating in the UK dog population, with evidence of exposure to cnv prior to its first discovery in 2007. The study also identified variation in seroprevalence between the prevalence of the different strains, with strain HK having the highest sequence identity to an intergenotype GII recombinant human norovirus strain and it is suggested that strain HK may be classified into a novel genogroup.",PMC3855277,PMC3855277_4
