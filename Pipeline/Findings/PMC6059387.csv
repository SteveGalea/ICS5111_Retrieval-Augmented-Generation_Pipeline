"The study identifies children as significantly more susceptible to hrv infection than adults and more likely to transmit the virus within households, while evidence for transmission by adults is lacking.",PMC6059387,PMC6059387_0
"Households with younger children have a higher prevalence of hrv, as predicted, and transmission by individuals with symptoms is higher within households.",PMC6059387,PMC6059387_1
"Loss of hrv is reduced when others in the household are infected, potentially due to reinfection, and a reduced apparent loss rate of hrv infection is detected in hosts infected with coronavirus.",PMC6059387,PMC6059387_2
"The study provides evidence for intrahousehold transmission for coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, influenza, and bocavirus, and reduced susceptibility with older age in paramyxoviruses, influenza, and bocavirus.",PMC6059387,PMC6059387_3
"Simulation of hrv based on these data matches the broad structure of the data, both at the level of the population and as a function of age and household structure, although without capturing all forms of heterogeneity.",PMC6059387,PMC6059387_4
