"hBV is a member of the parvovirus family, which infects birds and mammals, and belongs to the recently established genus bocavirus.",PMC1200281,PMC1200281_1
"hBV was primarily found in respiratory tract samples from children with unknown etiology, suggesting a likely causative role in respiratory tract disease.",PMC1200281,PMC1200281_2
"hBV was detected in 7% of respiratory tract samples from children with respiratory tract symptoms, but was not detected in samples from children without respiratory tract symptoms.",PMC1200281,PMC1200281_3
"The study used a combination of host dna depletion, optimized nucleic acid amplification, large-scale sequencing, and bioinformatics to identify unknown viruses, and suggested that this method is efficient for virus discovery.",PMC1200281,PMC1200281_4
