"A protease inhibitor, ben-hcl, can effectively suppress sars-cov infection, and it appears to inhibit viral entry into target cells but does not appear to block other steps of viral replication.",PMC2323977,PMC2323977_0
"The s protein of sars-cov is cleaved into functional s1 and s2 subunits by the protease factor xa, which is expressed by target cells and is able to effectively cleave the full-length recombinant s protein into s1 and s2 subunits.",PMC2323977,PMC2323977_1
"The cleavage of the s protein into functional s1 and s2 subunits is inhibited by ben-hcl, and the level of cleavage correlates with viral infectivity.",PMC2323977,PMC2323977_2
"The target cells express factor xa, a membrane-bound protease, and the cleavage of the s protein may trigger virus-cell fusion subsequent to the binding with the ace2 receptor and the dissociation of trimeric s protein to monomers.",PMC2323977,PMC2323977_3
Inhibition of the cleavage of the s protein into functional s1 and s2 subunits using agents such as ben-hcl can effectively block viral entry.,PMC2323977,PMC2323977_4
