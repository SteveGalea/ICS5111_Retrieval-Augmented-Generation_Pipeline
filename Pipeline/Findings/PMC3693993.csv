"According to guidelines from low and middle income countries, cloth masks or improvised masks are commonly used as respiratory protective devices during pandemics, although their effectiveness in blocking influenza or virus transmission is less than that of surgical masks or respirators. Some countries, such as China and Vietnam, recommend the use of woven cloth masks in low resource settings, but caution around their use is advised as they provide considerably less protection than surgical masks or respirators.",PMC3693993,PMC3693993_0
"The guidelines from some countries, such as France and Austria, recommend the use of FFP2 and FFP3 respirators for healthcare workers in low and high risk situations during pandemics. These policies are in line with those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US.",PMC3693993,PMC3693993_1
"The situation in low income settings should be considered, and various options should be explored. There is a need for further studies to generate better evidence to inform policy and current practices, particularly around the modes of transmission of respiratory viruses, the efficacy of cloth masks, and the impact of extended and re-use of masks/respirators.",PMC3693993,PMC3693993_2

"The availability of conflicting guidance around mask use from different sources, such as those from the World Health Organization (WHO) and country-specific guidelines, may be confusing for end-users in healthcare facilities. A uniform policy on mask and respirator use in healthcare facilities should be jointly evaluated by health organizations and countries, particularly in low income settings where further studies are needed to generate better evidence to inform policy and current practices.",PMC3693993,PMC3693993_4
