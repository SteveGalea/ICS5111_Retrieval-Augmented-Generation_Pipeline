The study describes the development and evaluation of two real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting the mycoplasma amphoriforme (M. Amphoriforme) 16S rRNA gene and the upstream region of the 23S rRNA gene for the specific and sensitive detection of M. Amphoriforme.,PMC3993489,PMC3993489_0
"The study reports the detection of M. Amphoriforme in respiratory samples from 37 patients with suspected respiratory tract infection, with 17 patients (25.5%) and 14 patients (24.3%) being positive for M. Amphoriforme by the 16S rRNA PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR), respectively. The study also describes the detection of M. Amphoriforme in respiratory samples from 10 patients with suspected respiratory tract infection, with an incidence of 0.21%.",PMC3993489,PMC3993489_1
"The study highlights the importance of developing and evaluating new molecular tools for the diagnosis of M. Amphoriforme infection, as the organism's pathogenic potential remains largely unknown.",PMC3993489,PMC3993489_2
"The study suggests that M. Amphoriforme may be a primary respiratory pathogen, as it was detected in respiratory samples from 37 patients with suspected respiratory tract infection, and the high incidence of M. Amphoriforme (19.3%) in sputum samples from patients with immunodeficiency suggests that it may be an important cause of infection in this patient group.",PMC3993489,PMC3993489_3
"The study also reports the detection of viral coinfection in 10 M. Amphoriforme-positive samples, all from children, but viral infection was not detected in any of the M. Amphoriforme-positive samples from adult patients. Further longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the periodicity of M. Amphoriforme infection.",PMC3993489,PMC3993489_4
