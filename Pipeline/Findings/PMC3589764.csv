"Individual hosts and species can make disproportionately large contributions to disease transmission, termed ""superspreaders"" and ""superspreading species"", respectively. These hosts and species are responsible for a greater than expected fraction of transmission events in a population, and identifying them before infecting others can greatly enhance disease control strategies.",PMC3589764,PMC3589764_0
"Transmission heterogeneity occurs not only among hosts, but also across space, with certain locations or environmental conditions facilitating elevated transmission rates. These ""hotspots"" or ""foci"" can be analogous to superspreaders in their ability to amplify transmission and should be targeted in disease control efforts.",PMC3589764,PMC3589764_1
"Transmission heterogeneity is intimately linked across scales, with host and spatial transmission heterogeneities influencing each other. Understanding these connections will aid in developing an integrative theory for understanding transmission heterogeneity across scales.",PMC3589764,PMC3589764_2
"Transmission heterogeneity can have important consequences for disease dynamics and host-pathogen evolution. For example, it can affect the probability of major outbreaks, slow epidemic growth rates, and alter the co-occurrence of diseases across host species.",PMC3589764,PMC3589764_3
"The causes of transmission heterogeneity, as well as the pathogen transmission modes most commonly associated with heterogeneity, are important avenues for further research. For example, heterogeneity in contact rates may be more important than heterogeneity in infectiousness, and environmental transmission heterogeneity may be more prevalent among pathogens with density-dependent transmission or environmentally transmitted stages.",PMC3589764,PMC3589764_4
