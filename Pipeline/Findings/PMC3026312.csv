"In capsid assembly, the use of assembly models has revealed that kinetic effects, rather than simple inhibition, can be highly effective in disrupting viral propagation. Weak interactions between protein subunits or glycoprotein complexes minimize production of misassembled spikes, making altering the kinetics, misdirecting the intermediates, or stabilizing an interaction to prevent disassembly all viable options for disrupting a highly evolved set of reactions to achieve the same end goal: reduced virus propagation.",PMC3026312,PMC3026312_0
"The assembly of alphavirus glycoprotein spike complexes is a regulated process that occurs early in assembly. Interfering with the assembly of the alphavirus e2–e1 dimer, either through stabilization or destabilization, would severely affect the allosteric regulation by the sensor residues during fusion and, as a result, cell entry would be blocked.",PMC3026312,PMC3026312_1
"The assembly of alphavirus spike complexes requires a specific pe2–e1 dimer early in assembly. Activation of viral fusion proteins, such as the class ii fusion proteins, requires a distinct chaperone protein. Pe2 acts as an effector of e1 activation at two different times, as a chaperone and by releasing e3 for activation.",PMC3026312,PMC3026312_2
"The viral fusion proteins fill many roles, such as mediating fusion between the viral and host membrane via the fusion protein. For example, in contrast to alphaviruses, immature and mature flaviviruses have radically different structures. The unique properties among class iii fusion proteins, suggestive of allosteric conformational changes, also prevent premature fusion during assembly.",PMC3026312,PMC3026312_3
Both capsid and glycoprotein assembly are carefully orchestrated events requiring activation by known and unidentified effectors. Interfering with allosteric responses to effectors and environmental sensors could be equally beneficial in disrupting a highly evolved set of reactions to achieve the same end goal: reduced virus propagation.,PMC3026312,PMC3026312_4
