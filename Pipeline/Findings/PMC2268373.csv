"This study developed a multitarget approach for ar preparation, which allows for the simultaneous amplification of three respiratory viruses in a single reaction mixture, including influenza a virus, influenza b virus, and sars-cov. The method involves the design of specific primers and probes to amplify highly conserved regions of the matrix gene, which are then packaged into ar-2. This approach enables almost all influenza viruses with different serum types to be detected in a real-time rt-pcr format, making it suitable for screening of influenza a and b viruses at the molecular level.",PMC2268373,PMC2268373_0
"The current ar purification method, which involves the combined use of gradient ultracentrifugation, column chromatography, and co2+ affinity chromatography, is efficient and easy to operate compared to traditional cscl fractionation methods. Ar-2 is purified as an rna-protein complex and electroeluted from an agarose gel with a gebaflex tube, which allows for a higher sensitivity in multiplex real-time rt-pcr assays.",PMC2268373,PMC2268373_1
"The positive coincidence rate for the multiplex real-time rt-pcr format was 96.8% among 290 respiratory samples for influenza a virus, 95.3% among 80 respiratory samples for influenza a virus, and no bni 1 fragment-positive samples were monitored. The average ct values for the three genes in single primer-probe reactions were 25.92, 26.46, and 26.95 for the am, bm, and bni 1 fragments in single primer-probe reactions, respectively, and the average ct values for the three genes in the multiplex format were 26.07, 26.34, and 27.15 for the fam, hex, or rox channels, respectively.",PMC2268373,PMC2268373_2
"The current ar preparation method provides a means of evaluating all steps of the assay, as ar-2 could provide a safe, stable, and physically characteristic substitute for the three target viruses within the respective real-time rt-pcr assays. Ar-2 is able to mimic the natural virus within the respective real-time rt-pcr assays for each of the",PMC2268373,PMC2268373_3
