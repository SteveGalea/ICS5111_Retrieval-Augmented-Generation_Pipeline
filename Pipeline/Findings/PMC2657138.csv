IBV strain m41 exhibits a wide tissue tropism including the nervous system and the proventriculus in chicken embryos.,PMC2657138,PMC2657138_0
IBV antigen is present in the musculature of both the gizzard and proventriculus of inoculated embryonic chicken.,PMC2657138,PMC2657138_1
IBV infection of the proventriculus is not a classic feature of ibv and may be explained by the presence of polysialylated n-cam (neural cell adhesion molecules) in chicken embryos.,PMC2657138,PMC2657138_2
