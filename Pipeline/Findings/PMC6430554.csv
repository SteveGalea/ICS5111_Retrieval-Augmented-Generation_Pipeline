"The study found that hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 8, previously detected in camels in China, can cause acute hepatitis in cynomolgus macaques.",PMC6430554,PMC6430554_0
The study identified three complete genome sequences of HEV8 from the fecal sample collected from Gansu province (Bchev-GP) and two macaques that were inoculated with the filtered fecal sample containing Bchev-GP (M1 and M2).,PMC6430554,PMC6430554_1
The study performed histopathological and immunofluorescence assays on liver biopsies from the infected macaques to understand the pathogenicity of HEV8 in macaques.,PMC6430554,PMC6430554_2
The study quantified the hepatitis E virus genome copy number of HEV8 from the fecal sample collected from Gansu province (Bchev-GP) and the two macaques that were inoculated with the filtered fecal sample containing Bchev-GP (M1 and M2).,PMC6430554,PMC6430554_3
"The study constructed phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequences of the pcr screening fragments and the amino acid sequences of concatenated ORF1/ORF2 excluding the HVR in ORF1 to calculate the mean amino acid genetic distances between Bchev-GP, M1, and M2 and other HEV genotypes.",PMC6430554,PMC6430554_4
