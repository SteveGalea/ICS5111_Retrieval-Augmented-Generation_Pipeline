"Aging is associated with structural changes in the lungs, including a reduction in total lung capacity, decreased lung compliance, and altered lung elasticity, which place elderly patients at risk for poor airway clearance and increased morbidity and mortality.",PMC3825547,PMC3825547_0
"Inflamm-aging, the basal activation of the innate immune system in aged individuals in the absence of an immunologic threat, contributes to reduced elasticity and destruction of the delicate lung parenchyma with advanced age.",PMC3825547,PMC3825547_1
"The imbalance of immune mediators, delayed immune activation, and protracted course of inflammation associated with aging may result in increased morbidity and mortality in aging individuals following infection, environmental exposures, or systemic injury.",PMC3825547,PMC3825547_2
"Aging is associated with changes in the innate and adaptive immune systems, including altered expression and downstream signaling of toll-like receptors and reduced cytotoxicity and neutrophil recruitment, which compromise host defenses with age.",PMC3825547,PMC3825547_3
"COPD, the third leading cause of death worldwide, is prevalent in the elderly population, and careful consideration regarding treatment recommendations must be made in regard to treatment in this fragile population due to the many age-associated changes in the respiratory and pulmonary system.",PMC3825547,PMC3825547_4
