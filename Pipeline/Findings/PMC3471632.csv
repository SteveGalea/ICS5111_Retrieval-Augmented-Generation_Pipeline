"In a large longitudinal surveillance study of polyomavirus kipyv and wupyv in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, 37% of patients had prolonged detection episodes, and young age and detection of a respiratory virus within the previous 2 weeks were independent risk factors for detection of kipyv or wupyv.",PMC3471632,PMC3471632_0
"Kipyv and wupyv were commonly co-detected with respiratory viruses, and concurrent detection of polyomaviruses and respiratory viruses was associated with prolonged detection episodes and high viral copy numbers in respiratory specimens.",PMC3471632,PMC3471632_1
"The seroprevalence of antibodies to kipyv and wupyv for children 5â€“20 years of age was similar to that for adults, suggesting that primary exposure occurs in childhood.",PMC3471632,PMC3471632_2
"In a cohort of 136 nasal wash specimens from hct recipients with respiratory illnesses, respiratory viruses were often co-detected with kipyv and wupyv, and a respiratory virus infection was an independent risk factor for kipyv detection.",PMC3471632,PMC3471632_3
"In conclusion, the study did not find a clear role for these viruses as respiratory pathogens with classic upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms, although further investigations may be necessary to elucidate the role of these viruses in highly immunocompromised patients.",PMC3471632,PMC3471632_4
