"In a study on isothermal nucleic acid amplification, the authors discussed various techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), strand displacement amplification (SDA), rolling circle amplification (RCA), helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), and beacon-assisted detection amplification (BAD-AMP). They found that HDA and RCA have the potential to be applied in point-of-care devices due to their simplicity, low cost, and short detection times.",PMC3436031,PMC3436031_0
"The authors reported that HDA and RCA can be integrated into microchip-based systems for rapid, label-free, specific detection. They also mentioned that the development of chip-based isothermal assay systems has received great attention, and further improvement in on-chip sample pretreatment, miniaturization of detectors, decrease in power consumption, and the establishment of quality control is required for their commercialization.",PMC3436031,PMC3436031_1
"The authors observed that integrated microchip systems are particularly desirable because these systems provide significant advantages in convenience and cost-effectiveness, simultaneously simplifying operational procedures and shortening analysis times. They also noted that no device reported thus far is clearly superior, resulting in the possibility that sensing platforms based on different isothermal amplifications may find their way to market.",PMC3436031,PMC3436031_2

"The authors reported that microfluidic dna assays involving on-chip isothermal amplification have also been developed for HDA. They noted that such an integrated microchip device, with its ease of use and short detection time, can become a portable device for rapid, label-free, specific detection.",PMC3436031,PMC3436031_4
