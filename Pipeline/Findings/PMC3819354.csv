"The authors developed a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method, called fluorescence-based immunochromatography (flic), for the detection of avian influenza virus subtypes H5N1 and H5N2.",PMC3819354,PMC3819354_0
"Flic can detect both H5N1 and H5N2 subtypes simultaneously, which is important for surveillance and control of avian influenza virus infections.",PMC3819354,PMC3819354_1
"The authors also developed a rapid diagnostic test for avian influenza virus infection, called super rapid avian influenza virus diagnostic test (sravd), which can be used to detect avian influenza virus infection in 15 minutes.",PMC3819354,PMC3819354_2
"The authors established a rapid and simple method to prepare antibody-conjugated fluorescent latex beads for use in flic, which can be used to detect avian influenza virus infection in various animal species.",PMC3819354,PMC3819354_3
"The authors also developed a simple and rapid method to detect avian influenza virus infection in animal tissues, using a fluorescence-based immunochromatography strip (ic strip).",PMC3819354,PMC3819354_4
