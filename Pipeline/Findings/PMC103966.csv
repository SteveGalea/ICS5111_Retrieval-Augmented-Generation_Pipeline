"This study demonstrates that ebola virus glycoprotein (gp) is endoproteolytically processed into two subunits, gp1 and gp2, during maturation, and that gp2, which is homologous to the tm glycoproteins of the oncoretroviruses, is cleaved after a conserved dibasic motif in all known strains of ebola virus and Marburg virus.",PMC103966,PMC103966_0
"The study shows that ebola virus glycoprotein processing is not required for viral entry, as the uncleavable glycoprotein mutant ebola gp.cl(-) was able to mediate viral entry into a variety of cell types as efficiently as the wild-type glycoprotein, indicating that, unlike most other cleaved viral glycoproteins, endoproteolytic processing is not required for ebola virus glycoprotein function.",PMC103966,PMC103966_1
"The study suggests that endoproteolytic processing of ebola virus glycoprotein may be important for viral replication only in certain cell types, as the absolute conservation of the dibasic cleavage site in all filoviruses might suggest that endoproteolytic processing of ebola gp is critical for some stage of the viral life cycle.",PMC103966,PMC103966_2
"The study reveals that ebola virus glycoprotein processing is not required for viral growth in the cells of vertebrates, as the virus retains the ability to grow in the cells of vertebrates, albeit with significantly reduced efficiency, as seen in the case of the sindbis virus e2 glycoprotein.",PMC103966,PMC103966_3
"The study suggests that the absolute conservation of the cleavage site in all filoviruses might provide important clues for the identification of the elusive ebola virus reservoir, as the analysis of the ability of mlv(ebo gp) and mlv(ebo gp.cl(-)) to infect a very wide selection of different cell types from diverse species might provide important clues for the identification of the elusive ebola virus reservoir.",PMC103966,PMC103966_4
