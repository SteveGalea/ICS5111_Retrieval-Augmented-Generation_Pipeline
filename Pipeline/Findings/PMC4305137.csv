"The study found that adenovirus species C, consisting of genotypes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 57, is the most frequent adenovirus species infecting the lower airways of young children with chronic endobronchial suppuration.",PMC4305137,PMC4305137_0
"The study demonstrated a significant association between adenovirus infection and lower airway bacterial infection in these children, suggesting a possible role of adenovirus in the pathogenesis of chronic suppurative lung diseases in young children.",PMC4305137,PMC4305137_1
"The study found that younger children are more likely to have polymicrobial infection, with a strong relationship between age and adenovirus status, and increased odds of bacterial coinfection with adenovirus in younger children.",PMC4305137,PMC4305137_2
"The study identified a systemic immune response to adenovirus in the airways of these children, as evidenced by elevated levels of natural killer cells in adenovirus-positive children.",PMC4305137,PMC4305137_3
"The study highlighted the negative association between adenovirus and Staphylococcus aureus in the lower airways, which may be due to the increased presence of other bacterial pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae, in adenovirus-positive children.",PMC4305137,PMC4305137_4
