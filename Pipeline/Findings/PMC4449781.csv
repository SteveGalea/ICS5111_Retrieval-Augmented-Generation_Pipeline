The study found that high-producing alleles of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 -589T and IL13 431A are associated with protection against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with trauma/injury.,PMC4449781,PMC4449781_0
"The study also revealed that patients with the IL6 -174C/C genotype had higher levels of bilirubin, bun, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the first 2 weeks after injury, suggesting a potential link between stronger hepatotoxic effects in these patients and increased levels of these metabolic indicators.",PMC4449781,PMC4449781_1
"The study observed protective effects of high-producing alleles IL1B -511A and IL8 -251A in patients with sepsis, but also found that the IL8 -251A allele was associated consistently with higher sofa scores.",PMC4449781,PMC4449781_2
"The study found that patients with the IL6 -174C/C genotype had higher Apache II and sofa scores in the first week after injury, but the associations between SNPs in the genes of cytokines and biochemical variables were limited by the multiple comparison issue.",PMC4449781,PMC4449781_3
"The study suggested that a powerful proinflammatory response can have beneficial effects on sepsis development, but may increase the risk of subsequent organ damage.",PMC4449781,PMC4449781_4
