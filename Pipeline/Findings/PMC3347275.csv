"The biosynthetic incorporation of an alkyne-modified eu, followed by click chemistry to attach fluorescent azide derivatives to newly synthesized, presumably full-length as well as subgenomic, coronaviral rnas, provides a specific visualization method suitable for the detection of nascent, presumably full-length as well as subgenomic, coronaviral rnas in the presence of actinomycin d.",PMC3347275,PMC3347275_0
"The colocalization of eu labeling with nsp2/3 and dsrna, which was obvious early in infection, appeared to decrease in time, as many dsrna dots were apparently not transcriptionally active at later times when the dsrna dots had spread throughout the cell.",PMC3347275,PMC3347275_1
"The dispersal of dsrna dots does not depend on a functional microtubular network, while eu-positive foci were still clearly colocalizing with nsp12 at late times of infection.",PMC3347275,PMC3347275_2
"Early in infection nascent rnas and nsp's colocalized with or occurred adjacent to dsrna foci, while at later time points the correlation between dsrna dots, nsp2/3, and nascent rnas was less obvious.",PMC3347275,PMC3347275_3
"Foci of nascent rnas were always found to colocalize with nsp12, regardless of the time point during infection.",PMC3347275,PMC3347275_4
