"In a study investigating the role of interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins in viral entry, researchers found that IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 proteins, which are expressed in response to IFNα, can inhibit the entry of viruses from the Flaviviridae, Retroviridae, and Lentiviridae families. This inhibition is achieved through the binding of IFITMs to early endosome markers, such as Rab5 and Rab7, which prevents viruses from accessing their cellular receptors.",PMC4581848,PMC4581848_0
"In another study, researchers found that IFITM1 and IFITM3 proteins can also inhibit the entry of viruses from the Nidoviridae family, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), by binding to the endosomal protein EEA1. This binding prevents RSV from accessing its cellular receptor, the intercellular adhesion molecule 150 (ICAM-150), which is required for viral entry.",PMC4581848,PMC4581848_1
"In yet another study, researchers found that IFITM1 and IFITM3 proteins can also inhibit the entry of viruses from the Coronaviridae family, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), by binding to early endosome markers, such as Rab5 and Rab7, which prevents viruses from accessing their cellular receptors. This binding also results in the accumulation of viral particles in early endosomes, which may contribute to the inhibition of viral entry.",PMC4581848,PMC4581848_2
"In all of these studies, the researchers used a variety of techniques to investigate the role of IFITMs in viral entry, including transfection of cells with IFITM-expressing plasmids, infection of cells with viruses in the presence or absence of IFNα, and flow cytometry to monitor the cleavage of substrates by viral proteases. These findings suggest that IFITM proteins are a crucial component of the innate immune response against viral entry and may have potential applications in the development of antiviral therapies.",PMC4581848,PMC4581848_3
