"The cotton rat, a small mammal, hosts infection with human rhinovirus (HRV) type 16 and exhibits measurable pathology, mucus production, and expression of inflammatory mediators.",PMC4199241,PMC4199241_0
"Intranasal infection with HRV16 results in the production of low levels of neutralizing antibodies that confer reduced protection against re-challenge, while intramuscular immunization with live HRV16 results in strong type-specific protection that correlates with high levels of systemic neutralizing antibodies.",PMC4199241,PMC4199241_1
"Passive transfer of antibodies generated in vaccinated cotton rats can protect na√Øve animals from pulmonary infection, demonstrating that the cotton rat is a suitable animal model for challenge studies to explore the development of anti-rhinovirus vaccines and anti-viral therapies.",PMC4199241,PMC4199241_2
"Maternal immunization with HRV16 in cotton rats results in complete protection against intranasal challenge in newborn pups, and passive transfer of maternal antibodies is also effective, with a neutralizing antibody titer of 320 being sufficient for a 2 log10 reduction in viral load in the lung.",PMC4199241,PMC4199241_3
"The cotton rat model provides strong evidence that the parenteral route of immunization can be effective in the context of HRV infection, highlighting the large potential of the cotton rat to provide an experimental platform complementary to that offered by mouse models for further evaluation of antibody-based strategies to support new developments in this area.",PMC4199241,PMC4199241_4
