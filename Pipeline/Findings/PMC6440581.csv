"In a study on the transmission of mumps in the Netherlands, a time-place-type algorithm was used to identify five significant clusters. Clusters 1-3, which contain smaller clusters, were found to be highly plausible, while cluster 4, which contains nested clusters, has moderate plausibility due to the presence of mumps sequences from two different branches in the phylogenetic tree. Cluster 5, which contains sequences from multiple branches of the phylogenetic tree, was found to have low plausibility, as the mumps virus has a very low mutation rate.",PMC6440581,PMC6440581_0
"The time-place-type algorithm was able to handle incomplete data, such as cases with missing sequences, by performing a partial data analysis. It can also be extended to include additional or reduce the number of dimensions, depending on the quality of the data from additional sources.",PMC6440581,PMC6440581_1
"The tool allows for fast and efficient information processing, which facilitates work for outbreak investigators, as human vision supports fast processing of information, and visual tools allow for quick decision-making.",PMC6440581,PMC6440581_2
"The tool was found to be more useful when cluster sizes are larger, as it can help focus on the most plausible clusters first. However, if the algorithm detects very small clusters (n<4), it is suggested to rely on other tools to determine whether an identified cluster is plausible.",PMC6440581,PMC6440581_3
"The study highlights the importance of considering disease-specific characteristics in the assessment of the plausibility of automatically identified clusters, as some diseases may have more relevance for certain dimensions over others.",PMC6440581,PMC6440581_4
