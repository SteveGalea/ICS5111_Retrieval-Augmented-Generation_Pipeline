"In a study examining the prevalence and clinical outcomes of respiratory viruses (RVs) in liver disease patients with pneumonia in intensive care units (ICUs), the overall prevalence of RVs was found to be 22.2%. Rhinovirus (RV) was the most common identified virus, followed by influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus.",PMC6943874,PMC6943874_0
"The study also found that mortality was significantly higher in RV-infected patients compared to patients without RV infection, but there was no significant difference in mortality between patients with viral-bacterial coinfections and patients with only RV infection.",PMC6943874,PMC6943874_1
"The study demonstrated that RVs other than influenza virus are important etiological factors of pneumonia in liver disease patients with cirrhosis admitted in ICUs, and that none of the previously done studies have shown the spectrum of different RVs in liver disease patients.",PMC6943874,PMC6943874_2
"The study also highlighted the importance of performing bronchoscopy and collection of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples in the most affected lung segment according to radiographic signs to recover the responsible RVs in patients with pneumonia, especially in patients having chronic liver disease.",PMC6943874,PMC6943874_3
"The study found that RVs were widely described as having mixed viral and bacterial infections in pneumonia patients in ICUs, but there was no significant correlation in mortality and median length of stay in ICUs between patients with only RV infection and viral-bacterial confection.",PMC6943874,PMC6943874_4
