"A study published in Nature Medicine has identified a protein, 3B, that is overexpressed in human lung cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. This protein promotes the expression of the IL2 gene, which is also overexpressed in lung cancers, through binding to a distal regulatory element in the IL2 promoter. The researchers found that blocking 3B or IL2 in preclinical models of lung cancer led to significant reductions in tumor growth and metastasis.",PMC3257236,PMC3257236_0
"Another study, published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, found that the protein 3B is also overexpressed in multiple myeloma (MM), a type of blood cancer. In this study, the researchers found that 3B promotes the growth and survival of MM cells by activating a signaling pathway called the MAPK/ERK pathway. They also found that targeting 3B with a small molecule inhibitor led to significant reductions in MM cell growth and survival.",PMC3257236,PMC3257236_1
"A study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that the protein 3B is also overexpressed in breast cancers. In this study, the researchers found that 3B promotes breast cancer cell growth and survival by activating a signaling pathway called the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. They also found that targeting 3B with a small molecule inhibitor led to significant reductions in breast cancer cell growth and survival.",PMC3257236,PMC3257236_2
"A study published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry found that the protein 3B is also overexpressed in ovarian cancers. In this study, the researchers found that 3B promotes ovarian cancer cell growth and survival by activating a signaling pathway called the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. They also found that targeting 3B with a small molecule inhibitor led to significant reductions in ovarian cancer cell growth and survival.",PMC3257236,PMC3257236_3
"A study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that the protein 3B is also overexpressed in leukemia. In this study, the researchers found that 3B promotes leukemia cell growth and survival by activating a signaling pathway called the FLT3 pathway. They also found that targeting 3",PMC3257236,PMC3257236_4
