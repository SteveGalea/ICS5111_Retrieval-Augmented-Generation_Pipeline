"The study found that llamas and pigs are susceptible to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection, shedding infectious virus for up to 4 weeks post-inoculation, although at lower levels than in dromedary camels.",PMC5324816,PMC5324816_0
"The study identified differences in virus susceptibility and pathogenicity between animals of different species, potentially due to distinct tissue distributions of the MERS-CoV receptor, dpp4, and host factors associated with innate immunity.",PMC5324816,PMC5324816_1
"The study found that horses, unlike llamas and pigs, were not productively infected by the MERS-CoV strain used in this study, possibly due to differences in the number of goblet cells in the lining epithelium and mucus production covering epithelial surfaces, which may have impeded the binding of the virus to the respiratory epithelium of horses.",PMC5324816,PMC5324816_2
"The study highlighted that members of the family Suidae, including common warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus), bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), and wild boars (Sus scrofa scrofa), could be potential reservoirs for MERS-CoV, as they are commonly found in the Greater Horn of Africa or the Middle East, sharing territories and water sources with dromedaries.",PMC5324816,PMC5324816_3
"The study suggested that differences in the number of goblet cells in the lining epithelium and mucus production covering epithelial surfaces could have influenced MERS-CoV transmission within and among species, as these animals are commonly found in the Greater Horn of Africa or the Middle East, sharing territories and water sources with dromedaries.",PMC5324816,PMC5324816_4
