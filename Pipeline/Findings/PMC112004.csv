"The authors developed a helper-dependent adenovirus (hd ad) vector for delivering the interferon (IFN)-α2 gene to the liver, which showed higher efficiency and greater therapeutic potency than a first-generation ad vector carrying the same expression cassette.",PMC112004,PMC112004_0
"Hd-IFN injection resulted in high levels of liver IFN-α2, which was dose-dependent and observed even at the lowest hd-IFN dose, which did not result in circulating IFN-α2.",PMC112004,PMC112004_1
"Hepatic expression of IFN-α2 led to liver protection in 80% of c57/b6 mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-3), and the reason why not all of the hd-IFN-injected mice were protected from MHV-3 challenge remains elusive.",PMC112004,PMC112004_2
"The authors observed no liver histology alterations in mice pretreated with hd-IFN, indicating that injection of hd-IFN had no negative effects on the liver tissue that could be ascribed to MHV-3 replication in association with the inflammatory response.",PMC112004,PMC112004_3
The authors believe that local delivery of IFN-α to the liver tissue with hd ad vectors might be a promising approach for the treatment of chronic hepatitis.,PMC112004,PMC112004_4
