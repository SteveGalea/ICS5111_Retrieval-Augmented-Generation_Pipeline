"The study found that sivsm, the simian immunodeficiency virus in sooty mangabey macaques, has a high degree of genetic variability, similar to that of HIV-1 in humans.",PMC1431560,PMC1431560_0
"The study identified a high number of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions and synonymous substitutions in both sivsm and HIV-1 env and gag genes, indicating a high mutation rate.",PMC1431560,PMC1431560_1
"The study found that the viral populations in individual animals do not vary randomly through time, and random trees of all variants were generated to determine the number of matching time-point sequences that formed a monophyletic clade.",PMC1431560,PMC1431560_2
"The study compared sivsm env nt sequences from nine patients of a study of 10 HIV-infected patients and found similarities in nt diversity, sequence length variation, and predicted n-linked glycosylation site density.",PMC1431560,PMC1431560_3
"The study found that the viral populations in individual animals do not vary randomly through time, and the number of matching time-point sequences that formed a monophyletic group were counted for each random tree.",PMC1431560,PMC1431560_4
