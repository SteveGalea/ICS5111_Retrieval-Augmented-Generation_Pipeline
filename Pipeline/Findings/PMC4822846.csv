"In the context of Ebola outbreaks, a comprehensive compartment prcc determination combined with latin hypercube sampling (lhs) was used for sensitivity analysis, which provided a measure of monotonicity between a set of parameters and the model output after removing the linear effects of all parameters except the parameter of interest [36]. This method, which is efficient and reliable, was employed due to the non-linear relationships between the Ebola virus transmission dynamics and the epidemic's spread patterns.",PMC4822846,PMC4822846_0
"In the context of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the epidemic's spread patterns were analyzed using a compartment transfer block diagram, which was constructed based on the transmission dynamics and control measures. The values of the parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, the standard contact rate, and the standard correlation coefficient-ρ, were determined using a nonlinear least-squares method.",PMC4822846,PMC4822846_1
"In the context of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Liberia, the epidemic's spread patterns were analyzed using a compartment transfer block diagram, which was constructed based on the transmission dynamics and control measures. The values of the parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, the standard contact rate, and the standard correlation coefficient-ρ, were determined using a nonlinear least-squares method.",PMC4822846,PMC4822846_2
"In the context of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, the epidemic's spread patterns were analyzed using a compartment transfer block diagram, which was constructed based on the transmission dynamics and control measures. The values of the parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, the standard contact rate, and the standard correlation coefficient-ρ, were determined using a nonlinear least-squares method.",PMC4822846,PMC4822846_3
"In the context of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, the epidemic's spread patterns were analyzed using a compartment transfer block diagram, which was constructed based on the transmission dynamics and control measures. The values of the parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, the standard contact rate, and the standard correlation coefficient-ρ, were determined using a nonlinear least-squares method.",PMC4822846,PMC4822846_4
