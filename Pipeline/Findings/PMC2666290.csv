"In a study examining the geographic distribution of resource gaps in response to a pandemic influenza, it was found that provinces with smaller population sizes and lower population densities may face significant challenges in mobilizing resources due to the limited availability of healthcare facilities and resources. This limitation was observed in Thailand, where the city of Bangkok, with a population of 10 million people and over 65 private hospitals with more than 50,000 beds, was excluded from the study. The study also highlighted the importance of addressing gaps in resources, especially in clinical and nursing staff, as well as in administrative and financial systems, to efficiently and effectively respond to the pandemic.",PMC2666290,PMC2666290_0
Another study focusing on the relationship between resource need and case-patients in pandemic influenza scenarios found that the capacity of the private healthcare sector may need to be drawn upon in a timely and effective manner during a pandemic crisis. This study also suggested that provinces with larger probable gaps in resources may require additional support to strengthen response capacity.,PMC2666290,PMC2666290_1
"A third study investigating the capacity of the health system resources in response to pandemic influenza scenarios in the region, which is at high risk for being at the epicenter of the next global pandemic of influenza, highlighted the importance of considering where health system resources in the region might best be positioned and further expanded to respond to more profound pandemic scenarios. The study also emphasized the need to reflect on the capacity of the private healthcare sector during a pandemic crisis and to make explicit planning decisions ahead of the pandemic.",PMC2666290,PMC2666290_2
