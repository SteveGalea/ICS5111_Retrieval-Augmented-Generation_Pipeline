"The overall mortality rate in pediatric patients with invasive fungal infections (IFIs) associated with hematological malignancies is still high, with reported crude mortality rates ranging from 30% to 52.5%.",PMC6742350,PMC6742350_0
"Despite an improvement in the outcome of IFIs in pediatric patients with hematological malignancies, combination antifungal therapy (cat) is still widely used in real-life settings, with reported rates of favorable responses ranging from 53% to 92%, and up to 45% of episodes being treated with first-line cat.",PMC6742350,PMC6742350_1
The use of cat in pediatric patients with IFIs is driven by concerns about prophylaxis-induced resistance and the more severe clinical conditions of these patients.,PMC6742350,PMC6742350_2
"The association of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) with caspofungin or posaconazole is associated with improved outcomes in the treatment of IFIs, with reported overall response rates ranging from 69.2% to 100%.",PMC6742350,PMC6742350_3
"The use of cat in pediatric patients with mucormycosis is associated with encouraging results, with reported overall response rates ranging from 100% to 87.5%.",PMC6742350,PMC6742350_4
"The combination of L-AMB with voriconazole is mainly used to treat central nervous system (CNS) aspergillosis, with reported overall response rates ranging from 100% to 87.5%, but studies are needed to establish the best treatment for this condition.",PMC6742350,PMC6742350_5
"The use of cat in pediatric patients with IFIs is associated with increased toxicity, but the association between cat and outcome is still a topic of controversy due to several confounding factors.",PMC6742350,PMC6742350_6
"The intrinsic resistance of Fusarium species to most antifungals leads to high mortality rates in pediatric patients with invasive fusariosis, but studies are needed to establish the best treatment for this condition.",PMC6742350,PMC6742350_7
"Cases of IFIs in pediatric patients with hematological malignancies are still associated with high morbidity and mortality, and cat might be regarded as a possible approach for IFIs in children with hemato-oncological diseases, especially in those with unfavorable prognosis.",PMC6742350,PMC6742350_8
