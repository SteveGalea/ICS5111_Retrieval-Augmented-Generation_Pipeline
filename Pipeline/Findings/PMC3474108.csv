"The most common radiological manifestations of swine influenza virus (s-oiv) infection in the early stages of the disease are bilateral multifocal asymmetric ground-glass opacities (ggos) and consolidations distributed predominantly in subpleural and peribronchovascular areas, corroborating previous reports.",PMC3474108,PMC3474108_0
"These ggo and consolidation abnormalities tend to progress to more extensive ggos with/without bilateral consolidation by the second week after the onset of symptoms, resulting in substantially reduced residual disease at 4 weeks or longer after disease onset.",PMC3474108,PMC3474108_1
"Air trapping was only observed in intensive care unit (ICU) patients who received long-term mechanical ventilation, and a small percentage of patients may develop superimposed complications such as pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, or show reticulation and traction bronchiectasis consistent with fibrosis.",PMC3474108,PMC3474108_2
"Future work on correlation between the findings of high-resolution computed tomography (hrct) with symptoms and pulmonary function, as well as the effect of drug treatment, would provide useful information for a better understanding of the disease and improvements in patient care.",PMC3474108,PMC3474108_3
Long-term follow-up with hrct and concomitant functional studies are required to determine the long-term pulmonary sequelae of s-oiv infection.,PMC3474108,PMC3474108_4
