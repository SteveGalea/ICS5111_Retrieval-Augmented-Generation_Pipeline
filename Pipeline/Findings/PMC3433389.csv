"A total of 215 swine sera were collected from three regions in the Philippines, including farms in Bulacan, Pangasinan, and Tarlac.",PMC3433389,PMC3433389_0
The serum samples were analyzed for the presence of antibodies to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and classical swine fever (CSF) using ELISA.,PMC3433389,PMC3433389_1
Recombinant Baculovirus expressing the ectodomain of VSV glycoprotein (GP) with a histidine-tag at its carboxyl terminus was used to prepare recombinant VSV-GP for IgG-ELISA.,PMC3433389,PMC3433389_2
"Recombinant Baculovirus, which expresses the ectodomain of CSF nucleoprotein (NP) and CSF-NP/GP, was generated using a previously described method.",PMC3433389,PMC3433389_3
The expression and purification of CSF-NP and CSF-GP were confirmed in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 staining.,PMC3433389,PMC3433389_4
