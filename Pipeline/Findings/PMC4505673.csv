"The study introduced an artificial cleavage recognition site for the furin protease into the pedv spike protein, resulting in trypsin-independent cell-cell fusion and virus entry in vitro.",PMC4505673,PMC4505673_0
"The furin cleavage site at the s2′ position of the pedv spike protein enabled the virus to infect cultured cells independently of trypsin, confirming the requirement for cleavage at this site for activation of coronavirus spike fusion proteins.",PMC4505673,PMC4505673_1
"The study found that the introduction of an artificial furin cleavage site at the s2′ position of the pedv spike protein did not result in detectable cleavage of virion-incorporated spike proteins, indicating that the introduced furin cleavage site was rather inaccessible for furin.",PMC4505673,PMC4505673_2
"The study showed that while field strains of pedv strictly require exogenous trypsin for propagation in vitro, serial passaging of the virus on cultured cells can lead to trypsin independence, suggesting that the rational or evolutionary adaptation of coronaviruses to the use of ubiquitous, endogenous proteases like furin for the activation of their spike fusion proteins may expand their tropism in vitro and in vivo.",PMC4505673,PMC4505673_3
