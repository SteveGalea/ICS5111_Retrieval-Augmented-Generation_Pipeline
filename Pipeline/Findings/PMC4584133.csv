The study aimed to identify different species of the fungus Trichophyton using molecular identification methods.,PMC4584133,PMC4584133_0
"The study found that the rolling circle amplification (RCA) technique, which involves using circularizable oligonucleotides or padlock probes, can rapidly and specifically identify Trichophyton species, with 100% concordance with phenotypic identification.",PMC4584133,PMC4584133_1
"The study also found that the specificity of the T. Tonsurans probe is ambiguous due to its close relationship with T. Equinum, as they differ by only a single base in the ITS1 region.",PMC4584133,PMC4584133_2
"The study suggests that designing padlock probes targeting other genes, such as BETA-TUBULIN (BT2) and TRANSLATION ELONGATION FACTOR 1-ALPHA (TEF1), may be beneficial for species identification, as the ITS1 region does not have sufficient discrimination ability.",PMC4584133,PMC4584133_3
"The study highlights that the RCA-based assay is an alternative to DNA sequencing for species identification, especially for epidemiological and phylogenetic purposes and for genotype delineation, despite the shortcomings of current molecular identification systems.",PMC4584133,PMC4584133_4
