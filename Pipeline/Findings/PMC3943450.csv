"The lbsapsal vaccine, which consists of crude antigens of Leishmania braziliensis, sand fly saliva extract, and saponin as an adjuvant, induces high levels of total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2 anti-Leishmania antibodies in dogs.",PMC3943450,PMC3943450_0
"The lbsapsal vaccine is able to activate parasite-specific memory T cells in dogs, as demonstrated by the persistent expansion of circulating CD8+ T cells and the increased stimulation index in response to antigenic stimulation with Leishmania braziliensis antigen, both observed in the presence of sand fly saliva extract.",PMC3943450,PMC3943450_1
"The lbsapsal vaccine is associated with a resistance phenotype against Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania braziliensis in dogs, as shown by the reduction in parasite load in the spleen, which persists long after challenge (885 days).",PMC3943450,PMC3943450_2
"The lbsapsal vaccine elicits a humoral immune response characterized by the expansion of circulating CD5+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells and the presence of high levels of total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2 anti-Leishmania antibodies, as well as the reduction in parasite load in the spleen, which persists long after challenge (885 days).",PMC3943450,PMC3943450_3
"The lbsapsal vaccine is able to limit parasite replication, even long after challenge (885 days), as demonstrated by the reduction in parasite load in the spleen, which persists long after challenge (885 days), and is consistent with the immune response induced by sand fly salivary proteins, which have been shown to protect against the fatal outcome of visceral leishmaniasis in a hamster model.",PMC3943450,PMC3943450_4
