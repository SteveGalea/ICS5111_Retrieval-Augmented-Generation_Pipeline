The study identified a single b-cell epitope 'tgldfsdlyyltmnnkhwlv' at position 194 to 213 with an immunogenic score of 1.2758.,PMC5379118,PMC5379118_0
The study predicted 16 helper t-cell epitopes and 25 hla class-i cytotoxic t-lymphocytes (ctl) epitopes for the 'env' protein of the zika virus.,PMC5379118,PMC5379118_1
All identified immunogenic epitopes were found to be non-toxic and non-variable.,PMC5379118,PMC5379118_2
"The study found that the predicted epitopes had excellent worldwide population coverage, with an average of 83.71% for hla class-ii and 96.37% for hla class-i.",PMC5379118,PMC5379118_3
The proposed non-toxic epitopes could represent a large proportion of the human population and could be relevant representatives for vaccine development against the zika virus.,PMC5379118,PMC5379118_4
