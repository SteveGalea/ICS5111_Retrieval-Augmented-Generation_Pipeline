"Ndv infection in hela cells leads to the upregulation of pkr and eif2α mRNA levels, as well as increased phosphorylation of eif2α at threonine 451, indicating activation of the integrated stress response (ISR).",PMC3994276,PMC3994276_0
"The ISR is crucial for viral replication in cells infected with the lentivirus ndv, as demonstrated by the reduction in viral replication observed in cells treated with specific siRNAs against pkr or eif2α.",PMC3994276,PMC3994276_1
"Ndv infection in hela cells also results in the activation of the ISR, as shown by the increased expression of ISG15 and ISG20 mRNA levels.",PMC3994276,PMC3994276_2
The use of siRNA against pkr or eif2α as a negative control in siRNA-treated cells infected with ndv further confirms the involvement of the ISR in viral replication.,PMC3994276,PMC3994276_3
"The study also highlights the potential use of siRNA against pkr or eif2α in inhibiting viral replication in cells infected with ndv, as demonstrated by the significant reduction in viral replication observed in cells treated with these siRNAs.",PMC3994276,PMC3994276_4
"The study also notes the importance of the ISR in the viral replication of lentiviruses, as shown by the reduction in viral replication observed in cells treated with specific siRNAs against pkr or eif2α.",PMC3994276,PMC3994276_5
"The study also emphasizes the need for further investigation into the role of the ISR in viral replication, as suggested by the finding that specific siRNAs against pkr or eif2α significantly reduce viral replication in cells infected with ndv.",PMC3994276,PMC3994276_6
"The study also highlights the importance of the ISR in the viral replication of lentiviruses, as demonstrated by the significant reduction in viral replication observed in cells treated with specific siRNAs against pkr or eif2α.",PMC3994276,PMC3994276_7
"The study also notes the importance of the ISR in the viral replication of lentiviruses, as shown by the reduction in viral replication observed in cells treated with specific siRNAs against pkr or eif2α.",PMC3994276,PMC3994276_8
