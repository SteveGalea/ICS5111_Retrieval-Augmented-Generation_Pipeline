"In experimental trials, a clear pathogen invasion threshold was observed in populations of Daphnia magna, with no successful pathogen transmission at low host densities and a sudden increase in infection events at high host densities. This threshold was qualitatively similar to predictions from deterministic and stochastic realizations of an epidemiological model, suggesting consistency with both deterministic and stochastic model realizations. However, there were differences between stochastic and deterministic model realizations, and both of these models from the experimental data.",PMC5792953,PMC5792953_0
"Predictions for the pathogen invasion threshold, defined as both r0>1 and as the probability of observing a primary infection event, obtained from deterministic and stochastic realizations of the epidemiological model, were qualitatively similar to experimental epidemics. The range of threshold values observed for the wide range of parameter space sampled in the model, including many important parameters related to pathogen transmission, production of infectious spores, and pathogen demography, generated a number of open questions concerning how environmental covariates, species interactions, or genetic factors may influence this critical threshold.",PMC5792953,PMC5792953_1
"Evidence that invasion thresholds may shift as a function of environmental context was provided by the range of threshold values observed for the wide range of parameter space sampled in the model, including many important parameters related to pathogen transmission, production of infectious spores, and pathogen demography. This generates a challenge for future research efforts to accurately capture transmission and infection dynamics in natural populations.",PMC5792953,PMC5792953_2
"Understanding how environmental covariates, species interactions, or genetic factors may influence this critical threshold is an important research area that may be informed through the use of existing data and the incorporation of stochasticity into invasion threshold estimate parameters. This is provided by the range of threshold values observed for the wide range of parameter space sampled in the model, including many important parameters related to pathogen transmission, production of infectious spores, and pathogen demography.",PMC5792953,PMC5792953_3
