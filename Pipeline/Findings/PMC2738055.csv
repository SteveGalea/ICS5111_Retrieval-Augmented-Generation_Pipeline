"The study compared the costs of four strategies for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections: dfa, dfa plus culture, dfa plus real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the xtag RVP test.",PMC2738055,PMC2738055_0
"The study found that the least costly diagnostic strategy was the xtag RVP test, which was less costly than testing by dfa followed by culture.",PMC2738055,PMC2738055_1
"The study showed that using the xtag RVP test resulted in a shorter hospital stay by 3 days, which accounted for over 90% of the savings.",PMC2738055,PMC2738055_2
"The study found that the use of the xtag RVP test was less costly than the testing algorithm of dfa plus culture, resulting in a savings of $291 per case investigated.",PMC2738055,PMC2738055_3
"The study found that multiplex PCR testing was the least costly diagnostic strategy and that when the cost of that strategy was compared with the cost of dfa plus culture, it would result in a savings of $529,620 per year on the basis of investigations for a total of 2,700 inpatients with respiratory virus infections.",PMC2738055,PMC2738055_4
