"A new adenovirus vector, based on the bonobo virus panad3, was tested as a potential ""universal"" influenza vaccine candidate. This vector, when used to express conserved influenza virus antigens, had highly effective protection against lethal challenge with mouse-adapted A/FM, with greatly reduced morbidity and mortality compared to controls.",PMC3594242,PMC3594242_0
"The panad3 vector induced both antibody and T cell responses to np, as well as antibody responses to the fusion protein of np with m1, which is a prominent target of T cell immunity in humans.",PMC3594242,PMC3594242_1
"Prior immunization with a gfp-expressing construct blocked subsequent responses to the transgene product only for homologous vector, with minimal cross-blocking.",PMC3594242,PMC3594242_2
"Human sera containing high anti-ad5 neutralizing activity (>1000) showed no or marginal neutralization capacity on panad3, while human sera with high ad5 neutralizing activity (>1000) had no or marginal neutralization activity on panad3 as well.",PMC3594242,PMC3594242_3
"The panad3-npm1 vaccine, when used to express conserved influenza virus antigens, had promise as a ""universal"" influenza vaccine candidate, as it was highly effective at inducing T cell and antibody immunity, while at the same time having the advantage that it is not neutralized by human sera.",PMC3594242,PMC3594242_4
