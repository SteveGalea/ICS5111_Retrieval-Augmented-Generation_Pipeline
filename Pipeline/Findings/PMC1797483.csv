"The study generated two types of recombinant chimeric viruses, one in which the entire jhm replicase gene was introduced into the a59 background (jhmrep-ra59) and the other in which the entire a59 replicase gene was introduced into the jhm background (repa59-rjhm).",PMC1797483,PMC1797483_0
"In vitro replication kinetics analysis showed that the replication kinetics of jhmrep-ra59 virus were similar to those of ra59, indicating that the replicase gene of jhm strain does not account for the nonhepatotropic phenotype of jhm.",PMC1797483,PMC1797483_1
In vivo studies demonstrated that the replicase gene of jhm strain does not determine the highly neurovirulent phenotype of jhm or the dualtropic phenotype of a59 (mildly neurovirulent and hepatotropic).,PMC1797483,PMC1797483_2
"The abilities of murine coronaviruses to replicate in the liver and induce hepatitis, as well as to spread and induce pathology in the brain, depend on the proteins encoded in the 3′ end of the genome, rather than the replicase gene.",PMC1797483,PMC1797483_3
"The study suggests that in the context of a59/jhm chimeric viruses, the replicase genes may be exchanged without detectable change in phenotype in vitro or pathogenesis in vivo, and the 3′ one-third of the genome encoding spike through nucleocapsid, rather than the replicase gene, determines the murine coronavirus pathogenic phenotype.",PMC1797483,PMC1797483_4
