"Infection of pregnant sows with prrsv results in high rates of in utero infection and birth of viremic piglets, leading to increased mortality and susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection, particularly with Staphylococcus suis type II.",PMC114243,PMC114243_0
"Piglets infected in utero with prrsv display severe immunosuppression, with reduced numbers of thymocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils in peripheral lymph nodes and bone marrow, as well as thymic involution.",PMC114243,PMC114243_1
Piglets infected in utero with prrsv and subsequently challenged with Staphylococcus suis type II have a significantly higher rate of mortality and infection compared to those infected with prrsv or Staphylococcus suis type II alone.,PMC114243,PMC114243_2
"The extreme susceptibility to Staphylococcus suis type II may stem from the age of the pig at the time of prrsv infection and the route of infection, as pigs infected at birth display more profound effects on the immune system and increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection.",PMC114243,PMC114243_3
"The exact mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility to Staphylococcus suis type II is not known, but may be related to changes in patterns of lymphocyte trafficking, loss of bactericidal function in tonsillar macrophages, or a loss of normal thymocyte development and selection processes.",PMC114243,PMC114243_4
