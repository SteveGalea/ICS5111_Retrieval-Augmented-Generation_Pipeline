"This study detected an infection frequency of 23% for the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus in a university community, with a moderate to severe acute respiratory illness frequency of 9.6%.",PMC3258274,PMC3258274_0
"Rhinoviruses, known to be common causes of acute respiratory illness in college populations, were as prominent as pandemic influenza A (H1N1) viruses as a cause of illness.",PMC3258274,PMC3258274_1
The study found evidence of a substantial degree of immunity to pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus despite the fact that about two-thirds of the population lacked detectable serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody to the epidemic virus.,PMC3258274,PMC3258274_2
"The human experience with influenza A (H1N1) viruses over the 93-year interval since 1918 has considerably increased our knowledge of influenza and influenza immunity, indicating a high level of immunity among adults 18 years and older despite relatively low levels of antibody.",PMC3258274,PMC3258274_3
"Overall, the study has indicated that the full susceptibility with high illness rates among healthy persons was only in children.",PMC3258274,PMC3258274_4
