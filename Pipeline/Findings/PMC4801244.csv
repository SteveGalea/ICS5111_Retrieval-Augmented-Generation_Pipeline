The current study identifies the chimeric sars-like virus wiv1-cov as a potential threat for future emergence in human populations due to robust replication in primary human airway epithelial cell cultures.,PMC4801244,PMC4801244_0
"In vivo studies in transgenic mice with airway-targeted overexpression of human ACE2 reveal that wiv1-cov replication is attenuated in mice expressing human ACE2, whereas it replicates efficiently in mice lacking human ACE2.",PMC4801244,PMC4801244_1
"Studies in aged mice reveal that wiv1-cov replication is attenuated in aged mice, whereas it replicates efficiently in young mice.",PMC4801244,PMC4801244_2
"Studies in transgenic mice with airway-targeted overexpression of human ACE2 reveal that wiv1-cov replication is attenuated in mice expressing human ACE2, whereas it replicates efficiently in mice lacking human ACE2, and that aged mice have a reduced capacity to control wiv1-cov infection compared to young mice.",PMC4801244,PMC4801244_3
"Studies in transgenic mice with airway-targeted overexpression of human ACE2 reveal that wiv1-cov replication is attenuated in mice expressing human ACE2, whereas it replicates efficiently in mice lacking human ACE2, and that the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of wiv1-cov is critical for efficient replication in human airway epithelial cells and in mice.",PMC4801244,PMC4801244_4
