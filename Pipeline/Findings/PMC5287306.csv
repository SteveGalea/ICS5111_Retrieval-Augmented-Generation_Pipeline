"Self-assembled viral structural proteins and subviral particles can be generated through recombinant protein expression systems, providing a cost-effective approach to vaccine distribution, particularly in developing countries and remote areas.",PMC5287306,PMC5287306_0
"Vlps, small subviral particles, and protein polymers formed by self-assembling viral structural proteins have been used to develop subunit vaccines against a variety of human diseases, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis E, human papillomavirus, and malaria.",PMC5287306,PMC5287306_1
"Foreign antigens or epitopes can be incorporated onto these viral particle-based platforms to enhance immunogenicity, resulting in chimeric combination subunit vaccines against multiple pathogens or diseases.",PMC5287306,PMC5287306_2
"Challenges in developing effective, non-replicating subunit vaccines based on small antigens or epitopes due to low immunogenicity can be overcome by incorporating them onto larger, polyvalent, and highly immunogenic viral particle-based platforms.",PMC5287306,PMC5287306_3
"Different vaccine platforms, such as vlps, small subviral particles, and protein polymers, have unique features and limitations, and further development of these platforms will facilitate the advancement of combination subunit vaccines against a variety of human diseases.",PMC5287306,PMC5287306_4
