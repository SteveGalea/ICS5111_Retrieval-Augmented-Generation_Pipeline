"The study identified three nucleolar localization signals (nls1, nls2, and nls3) in the N-terminal region of the pcv3 orf2 protein, with nls1 (8rrr-r-rrr16) and nls2 (16rrrhrrr22) being essential for strict nuclear localization, similar to pcv1 and pcv2 orf2.",PMC6950156,PMC6950156_0
"The study found that the nls region of pcv3 orf2 may be involved in DNA binding, as the nls region of other circoviruses, such as PCV1 and PCV2, has been shown to interact with nuclear membrane receptors and regulate DNA accumulation.",PMC6950156,PMC6950156_1
"The study showed that the nls region of pcv3 orf2 may contain dominant epitopes, as predicted by pondr analysis, which suggests that these epitopes may influence antigenicity.",PMC6950156,PMC6950156_2
"The study found that the nucleolar localization signals in pcv3 orf2 may be involved in the regulation of viral replication, as nucleolar localization has been described for the proteins of many DNA and RNA viruses, and these viral proteins play multifunctional roles in regulating cellular transcription, virus transcription, virus translation, and cell division.",PMC6950156,PMC6950156_3
"The study found that the nls3 motif in pcv3 orf2 plays an auxiliary role in nuclear localization, as it displayed almost equal nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution, in contrast to the strict nuclear localization of nls1 and nls2.",PMC6950156,PMC6950156_4
