"The study found that following ozone treatment, in vitro excystation and dapi-pi overestimated oocyst viability compared to neonatal mouse infectivity assays, possibly due to the promotion of oocyst clumping and uneven distribution of dead and excysted oocysts in the excystation fluid.",PMC92099,PMC92099_0
"The study also indicated that syto-9 and syto-59 overestimated oocyst viability compared to infectivity assays of ozone-treated oocysts, despite their correlation with neonatal mouse infectivity assays in previous studies.",PMC92099,PMC92099_1
"The study found that in animal infectivity assays, untreated oocysts displayed greater variability both within and between laboratories than they did in the in vitro surrogates, with syto-59 being the least responsive assay.",PMC92099,PMC92099_2
"The study revealed that following ozonation, with low ozone concentrations and contact times, the in vitro excystation procedure was more problematic, as it yielded sporozoite ratios (number of free sporozoites/(number of excysted + number of partially excysted oocysts)) in excess of 10 in some samples, possibly due to oocyst clumping and uneven distribution of dead and excysted oocysts in the excystation fluid.",PMC92099,PMC92099_3
"The study suggested that there is an urgent need to standardize and evaluate potential viability assays, such as molecular viability markers and refinements in in vitro cultivation techniques, with respect to mouse infectivity, in order to overcome the ethical and financial constraints of using neonatal mouse infectivity assays to measure disinfection efficacy or to determine the infectivity of environmentally derived oocysts.",PMC92099,PMC92099_4
