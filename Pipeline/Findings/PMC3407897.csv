"The effects of lectins on HPV-2 infection were studied. Three lectins, con A, LCA, and PNA, were used to analyze the inhibition of virus entry, rNA synthesis, and protein synthesis.",PMC3407897,PMC3407897_0
"The lectins, which do not bind to the sugar moieties of HPV-2, were found to partially inhibit virus RNA synthesis and largely inhibited protein syntheses.",PMC3407897,PMC3407897_1
The lectins non-specifically prevented the entry of HPV-2 into cells by binding to the cell surface lectin receptors.,PMC3407897,PMC3407897_2
The study showed that the lectins had a partial inhibitory effect on HPV-2 RNA synthesis and largely inhibited protein syntheses.,PMC3407897,PMC3407897_3
The results suggest that the prevention of HPV-2 adsorption to the cells may be due to the non-specific hindrance caused by the lectins binding to the cell surface sugar moieties.,PMC3407897,PMC3407897_4
