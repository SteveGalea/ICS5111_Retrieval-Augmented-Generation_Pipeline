"The study identified six characteristic patterns in research activity for infectious diseases based on their disease burden, organism, transmission mode, availability of vaccine, and designation as neglected tropical diseases.",PMC6329976,PMC6329976_0
"The analysis revealed that some diseases with lower disease burdens, such as chagas disease and leishmaniasis, may have been underestimated due to potential underestimation of their disease burden in dalys.",PMC6329976,PMC6329976_1
"The study found that the relationship between disease burden and research intensity followed a double logarithmic linear relationship, and a change in the index of >1.0 over three decades with p<0.05 by the Jonckheere test was considered significant.",PMC6329976,PMC6329976_2
"The study identified infectious diseases that have received research attention or have been neglected by researchers from one viewpoint, and hoped these findings provide a basis for further discussion about the more appropriate allocation of research resources to infectious diseases.",PMC6329976,PMC6329976_3
"The analysis also showed that high, but decreasing, research intensity exists for some diseases with lower disease burdens, such as chagas disease and leishmaniasis, which may require further research.",PMC6329976,PMC6329976_4
