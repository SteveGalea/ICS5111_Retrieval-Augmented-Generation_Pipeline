"The study found that respiratory viruses are common in asymptomatic children, particularly in infants, with a prevalence of 27% for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 44% in infants younger than 1 year old.",PMC3147826,PMC3147826_0
"The study also found that while RSV was rarely detected in asymptomatic individuals, adenovirus (Adv) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) were frequently found in asymptomatic children.",PMC3147826,PMC3147826_1
"The study showed that for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), influenza A virus (InfA), and human coronavirus (hCOV), median viral loads differed significantly between symptomatic and asymptomatic children.",PMC3147826,PMC3147826_2
"The study suggested that cutoff values for influenza A virus (InfA) could easily be determined, as InfA was the only virus for which no overlap was noted between viruses in symptomatic and asymptomatic children.",PMC3147826,PMC3147826_3
"The study highlighted the need for larger samples sizes in a variety of different patient groups to overcome challenges in determining clinically relevant cutoff values for infections with viruses that are also found frequently among controls, and to design reliable receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for infections with viruses that are also found frequently among controls.",PMC3147826,PMC3147826_4
