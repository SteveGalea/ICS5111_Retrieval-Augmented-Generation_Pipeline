"In the section comparing the immunogenicity of four ag85a-mtb32 fusion antigens, a comparative study was performed using 50 mice divided randomly into 5 groups, each receiving 2.5 × 109 viral particles (vp) of recombinant adenovirus vectors intramuscularly at week 0. The mice were then boosted intranasally at week 3 with a total dose of 2.5 × 109 vp in 2 aliquots using a fine-tip pipette. After 2 weeks, 5 mice in each group were sacrificed, and lymphocytes from the spleen and lung were isolated and subjected to immunological assays.",PMC4514253,PMC4514253_0
"In the same section, a study was conducted to evaluate the boosting efficiency of adenovirus vector carrying ag85a-mtb32 fusion antigens on bcg-primed cell-mediated immunity responses. Thirty mice were divided randomly into 6 groups, each receiving 2.5 × 109 vp adenovirus vectors subcutaneously at week 0. The mice were then boosted intranasally with adenovirus vectors through 4 routes at week 6. After 2 weeks, the lymphocytes from the spleen and lung were isolated and subjected to immunological assays.",PMC4514253,PMC4514253_1
"In the section comparing the immunogenicity of four ag85a-mtb32 fusion antigens, an ifn-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay was performed to test the cmi responses induced by recombinant adenovirus vectors carrying different ag85a-mtb32 fusion antigens. Freshly isolated splenocytes and lung cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 2 × 106 cells per well and stimulated with either dmso (sigma) or peptide pools for ag85a or mtb32 (2 µg/ml per peptide). After 1 hour incubation at 37°C, the cells were mixed with brefeldin a (bd pharmingen) to inhibit cytokine secretion and were incubated for 16",PMC4514253,PMC4514253_2
