"In the context of the study on the development of a multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method for the simultaneous detection of avian influenza virus A (H5N1) and low-pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAI) in field samples, the authors designed a new primer and probe set for the simultaneous detection of H5N1 and LPAI, which showed high specificity and sensitivity in both singleplex and multiplex RT-PCR assays.",PMC7019278,PMC7019278_0
"The study found that the new primer and probe set for the pan-H5 HPAI (A) subtype and LPAI subtypes showed a limit of detection of 10 to 20 copies per reaction, which is similar to that of the singleplex RT-PCR assays.",PMC7019278,PMC7019278_1
The study confirmed the validity of the RT-PCR assay using H5N1-positive clinical field samples and all H5N1-positive sequences were verified using the Influenza Research Database.,PMC7019278,PMC7019278_2
"The study also found that the RT-PCR assay can simultaneously detect two clades of H5 HPAI virus, namely, H5N1 subtype 2.3.2.1 and subtype 2.3.4.4, which have been dominant in Asia and presented in Eurasia and Africa.",PMC7019278,PMC7019278_3
"The authors noted that their method development focused on H5N1 and two clades of H5 HPAI virus, which provides useful screening of clinical samples from domestic farms and live poultry markets.",PMC7019278,PMC7019278_4
