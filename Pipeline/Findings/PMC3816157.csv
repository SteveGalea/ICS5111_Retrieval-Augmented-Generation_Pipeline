Both cases presented in this report describe clinical remission of diabetes mellitus (DM) in cats with feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome (FCGS) under insulin therapy and a suitable diet.,PMC3816157,PMC3816157_0
"Both cats had a previous history of FCGS, with one cat also having a documented feline calicivirus (FCV) infection.",PMC3816157,PMC3816157_1
"Both cats had been treated previously with corticosteroids, which are considered a risk factor for DM in cats, and one cat had also been treated with long-acting corticosteroids.",PMC3816157,PMC3816157_2
"Both cats required insulin therapy for DM control, and one cat required a change in insulin type due to difficulty in controlling DM.",PMC3816157,PMC3816157_3
"Both cats presented with worsening FCGS symptoms during DM control, and oral rfeifn-ω (recombinant feline interferon omega) was successfully applied as an alternative to corticosteroids in both cases.",PMC3816157,PMC3816157_4
"In both cases, clinical improvement in FCGS symptoms was observed during oral rfeifn-ω therapy, with one cat showing a significant improvement in pain relief and reduced hypersalivation.",PMC3816157,PMC3816157_5
"Both cats achieved clinical remission of DM without further insulin therapy requirement, while continuing oral rfeifn-ω therapy.",PMC3816157,PMC3816157_6
The use of oral rfeifn-ω in these diabetic cats with FCGS provides further evidence for the successful use of this alternative therapy in cats where corticosteroid use is contraindicated.,PMC3816157,PMC3816157_7
