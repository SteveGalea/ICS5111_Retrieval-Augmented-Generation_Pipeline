"Older adults with respiratory illnesses may present with atypical symptoms, making diagnosis challenging.",PMC2826599,PMC2826599_0
"Influenza testing in older adults is problematic due to lower viral loads in respiratory secretions, poor sensitivity of culture and rapid antigen tests, and atypical presentations.",PMC2826599,PMC2826599_1
"Rapid antigen tests have variable sensitivity in older adults, with a maximum of 77% in outbreak settings and as low as 8%-22% in patients aged ⩾80 years.",PMC2826599,PMC2826599_2
PCR has surmounted the problems of poor sensitivity associated with culture and antigen detection in older adults and is the only currently available method for diagnosing coronaviruses and group c rhinoviruses.,PMC2826599,PMC2826599_3
Serological testing may be useful for retrospective analysis of nursing home outbreaks of respiratory disease due to its ability to detect a ⩾4-fold increase in viral specific antibody.,PMC2826599,PMC2826599_4
