"In a study published in BMC Infectious Diseases, a molecular diagnostic assay for measuring the viral load of measles virus (MV) in respiratory specimens and urine was developed and validated. The assay targets the highly conserved l gene and the variable h gene, allowing for simultaneous quantitation and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine-related strains.",PMC6440764,PMC6440764_0
"The assay was found to be sensitive for all listed global circulating genotypes, including genotypes a, b3, and d8, which are the most widely distributed types. It was less than 10 copies/reaction for all genotypes except genotype d8 using the h gene probe, but the sensitivity for genotype d8 using the l gene probe was 2 copies/reaction, which is operationally significant due to the high viral load in an infected individual in the prodromal phase or in an individual with a rash presentation for up to 10 days.",PMC6440764,PMC6440764_1
"The assay provides immediate differentiation between vaccine and wild-type strains with a high degree of certainty, which is critical due to the high infectivity of wild-type MV.",PMC6440764,PMC6440764_2
"The operational value of this assay is the high sensitivity for all the listed circulating global genotypes coupled with the immediate differentiation between vaccine and wild-type strains with a high degree of certainty, which allows for optimal management.",PMC6440764,PMC6440764_3
"In Canada and the United States, only the schwarz or moraten strain is used in measles-containing vaccines, respectively, which makes the rapid identification or exclusion of the schwarz or moraten strain, along with the patient's history, crucial for optimal management. However, in the context of samples tested at the provincial laboratory, the finding that one limitation of the SNP assay is that it is specific for the schwarz or moraten strain would not identify other vaccine strains, such as Zagreb or Shanghai-191, and differentiate them from wild-type strains, is less relevant due to the fact that the provincial laboratory has yet to encounter a case vaccinated outside of Canada, and the SNP assay would classify it as genotype A, which is likely of vaccine origin, as wild-type genotype A strains no longer circulate.",PMC6440764,PMC6440764_4
