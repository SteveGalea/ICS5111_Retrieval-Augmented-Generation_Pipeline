"In this study, mice were intranasally infected with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/chicken/Hebei/108/2002 (H5N1).",PMC2783028,PMC2783028_0
"Most infected mice developed typical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by fully developed bronchiolitis, peribronchiolar pneumonia, and fully developed ARDS.",PMC2783028,PMC2783028_1
"The infected mice exhibited typical interstitial and alveolar fibrosis, with thickened alveolar walls, collapsed alveoli, large organized areas, and reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes in organizing phase.",PMC2783028,PMC2783028_2
"The hydroxyproline levels increased significantly in h5n1-infected mice as compared to control group on day 30 p.i., which showed the deposition of collagen in lungs, and confirmed the fibrosis of lungs.",PMC2783028,PMC2783028_3
"Under the pressure of pandemic human-avian influenza in the near future, this study provides a valuable mouse model to study the development of this disease and to search for treatment of the human h5n1 influenza, as the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is not fully understood, and few drugs can be useful to prevent this disease because of its anti-inflammatory effects.",PMC2783028,PMC2783028_4
