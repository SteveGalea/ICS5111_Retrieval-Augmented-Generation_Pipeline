"The gut microbiome of agriculturally important animals, including poultry, is complex and consists of numerous microbes.",PMC4311960,PMC4311960_0
High-throughput sequencing technologies have facilitated the analysis of this complex microbiome through the use of multiple primer sets with specificity to previously described individual viruses or multiplexed assays targeting known viruses.,PMC4311960,PMC4311960_1
This culture-independent approach provides a broader picture of the enteric microbial community and has identified the rapid colonization of the spf chicken gut by numerous microbes in the commercial broiler and back yard flock environment.,PMC4311960,PMC4311960_2
The analysis has also provided insight into the potential roles enteric viral infections might play in disbacteriosis often noted in poultry with enteric disease and performance problems.,PMC4311960,PMC4311960_3
"The protocols for high-throughput sequencing are becoming more accessible and affordable, making this sort of metagenomic/community-level analysis applicable to diagnose animal disease through the identification of disease- or low performance-associated microbes or genes that are not present in the core microbiome of healthy pre-contact (i.e., spf) animals.",PMC4311960,PMC4311960_4
