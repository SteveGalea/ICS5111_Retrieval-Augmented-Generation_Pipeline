"Viruses such as hiv and cmv encode inhibitory substances that block apoptosis at almost every step in the ""save my cell"" antiapoptotic processes, allowing for persistence in the host and evasion of host immune responses.",PMC521982,PMC521982_0
"Viruses may alter the specificity of their essential core antigens to escape from specific immune recognition by cell-mediated effectors, allowing for antigenic variation and evasion of host immune responses during persistence.",PMC521982,PMC521982_1
"Viruses may interfere with normal cytokine signaling, inhibit or alter cytokine transduction pathways, and block apoptotic system activities to delay cell death until viral progeny have been formed and are infectious.",PMC521982,PMC521982_2
Viruses may encode mimics or homologs of cellular cytokine and chemokine receptors to veto killing processes through spurious recognition of a phony molecule as real.,PMC521982,PMC521982_3
"Viruses may encode homologs of mhc molecules to inhibit apoptosis and block cell death at essentially every step in the ""save my cell"" antiapoptotic processes, allowing for persistence in the host and evasion of host immune responses.",PMC521982,PMC521982_4
