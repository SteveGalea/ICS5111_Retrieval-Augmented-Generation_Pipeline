"The New Plague Strain: The report by the Technical Advisory Committee (tac) in India highlights that the new strain was not linked to any preexisting local foci or sites, implying that it was not the result of endemic or localized infections, which are commonly associated with poor, underdeveloped regions in India. The report also suggests that the new strain's emergence could not be attributed to any specific local site, as the strain's molecular traits were distinct and different from the existing plague strains in India.",PMC3093284,PMC3093284_0
"The Threat of Plague: The tac report in India clarifies that the plague threat was not an outcome of poor sanitation, hygiene, or living conditions, but was instead a result of bioterrorism, as the new strain's emergence could not be explained by the existing plague strains in India. The report also indicates that the new plague strain's emergence could not be attributed to any specific local site, as its molecular traits were distinct and different from the existing plague strains in India.",PMC3093284,PMC3093284_1
