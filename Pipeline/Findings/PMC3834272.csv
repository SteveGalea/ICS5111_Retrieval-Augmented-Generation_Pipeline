The study demonstrates that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a role in the pathogenesis of bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and fibrosis through the regulation of mononuclear phagocyte phenotype switching.,PMC3834272,PMC3834272_0
"Spironolactone, a clinically approved drug that targets the RAAS, attenuates bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and fibrosis by inhibiting the expansion of circulating inflammatory ly6chi monocytes and reducing the alternative activation of mononuclear phagocytes in the alveolar compartment.",PMC3834272,PMC3834272_1
The study highlights mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit ly6chi monocyte-mediated inflammatory response in acute lung injury and fibrosis.,PMC3834272,PMC3834272_2
"The study suggests that spironolactone-induced amelioration of lung injury is multifactorial, as it affects not only mononuclear phagocytes but also neutrophils and macrophages lacking MR, which exhibit alternative activation (m2 polarization).",PMC3834272,PMC3834272_3
"The study highlights the limitations of the current understanding of the effects of spironolactone on bleomycin-induced lung injury, including the need for monocyte-targeted approaches, the complexity of the algorithms used to identify macrophages, and the need for in vitro studies to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying suppressed ly6chi monocytosis by MR antagonism.",PMC3834272,PMC3834272_4
