"The study found no significant differences in time to nose down, blood glucose level, or behavioral measures between euthanasia in the home cage or induction chamber for both brown norway and sprague–dawley rats, suggesting that either location can be used for euthanasia using CO2.",PMC6241385,PMC6241385_0
"The study observed significant increases in serum corticosterone and noradrenaline levels in male brown norway rats, which may be due to the response to respiratory acidosis induced by CO2.",PMC6241385,PMC6241385_1
"The study found minimal jumping and digging behavior in both types of rats, with no significant differences between treatment groups in either location.",PMC6241385,PMC6241385_2
"The study found that approximately 10% of rats repeatedly returned to the port and sniffed the 100% CO2 being introduced into the cage, suggesting some interindividual differences in tolerance of exposure to high concentrations of CO2.",PMC6241385,PMC6241385_3
"The study found that brown norway rats engaged in rare digging behavior in the home cage, while neither brown norway nor sprague–dawley rats displayed digging behavior in the induction chamber, indicating definite interindividual differences in responses to the process of euthanasia.",PMC6241385,PMC6241385_4
