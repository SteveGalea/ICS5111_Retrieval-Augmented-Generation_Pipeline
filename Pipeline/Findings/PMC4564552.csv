"The study demonstrated the versatility of vsv vectors as a viable multivalent vaccine with the ability to confer protection against multiple unrelated and highly virulent pathogens with a single injection of vsvΔg-ha-zgp at 1 × 107 pfu. This vaccine platform, which is well-characterized and has been shown to induce strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, is attractive for mass immunization in humans due to its safety profile in animal studies.",PMC4564552,PMC4564552_0
"The study showed that a single administration of vsvΔg-ha-zgp at 1 × 107 pfu was fully protective against a highly pathogenic h5n1 virus with pandemic potential and a simultaneous challenge with 2 unrelated pathogens. The vsv vaccine tested elicited titers significantly above the protective limit against all tested h5n1 strains, resulting in complete cross-protection across clades 0, 1, and the highly divergent clade 2 of h5n1 viruses.",PMC4564552,PMC4564552_1
"The study revealed that cross-protection against h5n1 influenza may be based on other antibody mechanisms, or cellular immunity, as broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies were not detected postvaccination, which implies the mechanism for cross-protection against h5n1 influenza may be based on other antibody mechanisms, or cellular immunity.",PMC4564552,PMC4564552_2
"The study showed that while vsvΔg-ha-zgp was well-tolerated in mice, there is a need to fully elucidate the safety profile of this bivalent vaccine in order to facilitate clinical acceptance. The efficacy of vsvΔg-ha-zgp against a single or dual virus challenge increases its value as a vaccine against multiple pathogens as well as highlighting the vaccine's utility and flexibility, which may eventually result in an efficacious broad-spectrum vaccine against multiple pathogens with pandemic potential, without significant concerns of interference.",PMC4564552,PMC4564552_3
"The study highlighted the need for future experiments to include the testing of the bivalent vsvΔg-ha-zgp vaccine in higher animal models to confirm the observed protective effects, such as against ebov in nhps, and against both homologous and heterologous h5n1 strains in ferrets.
