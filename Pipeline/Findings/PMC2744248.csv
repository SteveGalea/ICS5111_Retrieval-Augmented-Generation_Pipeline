"Small mammal community structure in Portland, Oregon, USA, significantly affected sin nombre virus infection prevalence, with a threshold level of species diversity above which infection prevalence decreased due to encounter reduction.",PMC2744248,PMC2744248_0
"Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) were the dominant species in all parks, with an average of 62% of all captures.",PMC2744248,PMC2744248_1
"Infection prevalence was consistently low at 4 of 5 parks, with a significant increase in infection prevalence at only 1 park during year 2.",PMC2744248,PMC2744248_2
"The best fit model for the association between infection prevalence and mammal species diversity was of the form y = x / (ax + b), with an encounter reduction mechanism likely involved.",PMC2744248,PMC2744248_3
"Increased species diversity in the small mammal community structure did not significantly affect deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) density, suggesting that predators control infection prevalence through an unrelated mechanism, possibly encounter reduction.",PMC2744248,PMC2744248_4
