The study reports that the complete genome sequence of the SARS-CoV isolate BJ01 has been annotated and analyzed using gene prediction software and other approaches.,PMC5172239,PMC5172239_0
"The study found that the SARS-CoV genome, which is over 30 kilobases in length, contains only five well-established structural or non-structural proteins, which is fewer than expected for a virus of this size.",PMC5172239,PMC5172239_1
"The study also identified a hypothetical minus-strand hemagglutinin-esterase (he) protein in the SARS-CoV genome, although another well-studied virus, HCoV-229e, does not contain such a protein.",PMC5172239,PMC5172239_2
"The study suggests that large-scale recombination may have taken place in the SARS-CoV genome, based on the finding that relics of the he protein have spread to neighboring regions.",PMC5172239,PMC5172239_3
"The study proposes a possible explanation for the phenomenon of core segments (cuaaacgaa) in the SARS-CoV genome, which are similar to a consensus sequence found in the minus-strand sequence, but further experiments are required to prove these hypotheses.",PMC5172239,PMC5172239_4
"The study found that the SARS-CoV mRNAs are synthesized in amounts reversely related to their sizes, and the n protein is richer than any other proteins in infected cells, which supports a model of transcription called the minus-strand extending transcription model.",PMC5172239,PMC5172239_5
"The study also found that mutations introduced in different places along the genome decrease the transcriptional efficiencies or even eliminate the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs, but some subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized with mutated sites performed as markers, and the origin of the fused region can be traced. These findings provide evidence for the minus-strand extending transcription model.",PMC5172239,PMC5172239_6
"The study found that the length threshold for orfs is the same as that applied by Marra et al. to isolate Tor2, and a unique segment, the leader-mRNA junction, should exist upstream to the transcription initiation site, within a distance of 100 nt, except for the r protein.",PMC5172239,PMC5172239_7
