"A recent study investigating the presence of shiga-toxigenic E. Coli in a clinical sample used PCR- and dna-based identification methods, but even these might not be adequate for recognizing causation, since such false associations could lead to potentially dangerous treatments and might be harder to disprove than to generate initially. In fact, many of the pathogens that have been discovered through this approach fail to meet Koch's postulates for causality, as it is sometimes not possible to culture the pathogen or to identify a suitable animal model for further studies. For example, in a study of nasopharyngeal swabs taken from individuals in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, one sample contained a pair of reads that mapped with 97% nucleotide identity to ebola virus, but after further investigation, this finding was concluded to be contamination. In such circumstances, care must be taken not to create spurious links between infectious agents and disease, since such false associations could lead to potentially dangerous treatments and might be harder to disprove than to generate initially.",PMC3978900,PMC3978900_0
"Instead, metagenomic investigations of the microbiome could become so standard that dna sequencers could be used in household toilets to monitor changes in stool microbiome content, which could then be used to guide interventions to maintain health.",PMC3978900,PMC3978900_1
"The identification of a novel or complex infectious disease might require additional targeted diagnostic tests to further understand the clinical disease and determine management options. For example, urinary catheters could be treated with prebiotics to reduce the risk of colonization by harmful bacteria.",PMC3978900,PMC3978900_2
The greatest value of metagenomics is in clinical cases where conventional techniques fail to find a microbial cause.,PMC3978900,PMC3978900_3
"In fact, it has been suggested that metagenomic investigations of the microbiome could become so standard that they could be used as a complementary technique to be used alongside culture and other traditional methods for pathogen detection in a public health laboratory, and for inter-laboratory comparison of results.",PMC3978900,PMC3978900_4
"As whole-genome sequencing technologies decrease in price and increase in speed and simplicity, it is expected that metagenomics approaches will be applied more often in public health emergencies, and routine diagnostic pipelines are likely to evolve from ongoing collaborations between researchers and clinicians.",PMC3978900,PMC3978900_5
