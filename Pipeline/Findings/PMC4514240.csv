"In the study by H. et al., a recombinant measles virus (rmv) expressing the simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) gag antigen was generated and used to immunize mice. The study found that the rmv-sivgag virus induced a strong immune response, as evidenced by the detection of sivgag-specific CD8+ T cells and the production of interferon gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in splenocytes.",PMC4514240,PMC4514240_0
"In the study by M. et al., human CD46-transgenic mice (hcd46tg-b) were generated and used as a control. The study found that hcd46tg-b mice had significantly higher levels of CD46 and CD8 in splenocytes than wild-type mice.",PMC4514240,PMC4514240_1
"In the study by M. et al., a human CD46-transgenic mouse (hcd46tg-c) was generated and maintained at Crucell, Berna. The study found that hcd46tg-c mice had significantly higher levels of CD46 and CD8 in splenocytes than wild-type mice, but also had significantly higher levels of IFNγ and TNFα in splenocytes.",PMC4514240,PMC4514240_2
"In the study by M. et al., a recombinant measles virus (rmv) expressing the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) envelope protein (rmvb-hivenv clade b) was generated and used to immunize mice. The study found that the rmv-hivenv virus induced a strong immune response, as evidenced by the detection of hiv-specific CD4+ T cells and the production of IFNγ and TNFα in splenocytes.",PMC4514240,PMC4514240_3
