This study presents the synthesis of chiral zirconium quantum dots (QDs) and their application in a fluorescence-based bioassay for the detection of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).,PMC6120744,PMC6120744_0
"The QDs showed blue fluorescence and water solubility, as well as chirality, which is a unique property for QDs synthesized in group II-VI semiconductor materials.",PMC6120744,PMC6120744_1
"The QDs showed biocompatibility and no cytotoxicity effects on glioma cells at a concentration of 0.125 times dilution, indicating the potential for biomedical applications.",PMC6120744,PMC6120744_2
"The QDs showed a significant increase in fluorescence intensity in the presence of IBV, making them a highly selective and sensitive bioassay for virus detection.",PMC6120744,PMC6120744_3
The study also introduced a novel synthesis method for QDs and highlighted the potential for further research and optical applications.,PMC6120744,PMC6120744_4
