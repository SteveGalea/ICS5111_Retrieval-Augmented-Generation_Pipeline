"The study identified two proteins, prosaposin and cd44, as potential markers for uti in children with neurogenic bladders.",PMC6421595,PMC6421595_0
Both proteins showed low sensitivities but good specificities for distinguishing uti from utc.,PMC6421595,PMC6421595_1
The study found that urinary prosaposin and cd44 concentrations were increased in children with neurogenic bladders who had uti compared with those with utc.,PMC6421595,PMC6421595_2
Prosaposin was also elevated in children with neurogenic bladders compared with negative cultures.,PMC6421595,PMC6421595_3
"However, the study reported conflicting results between the identification and validation arms of the work, which may be due to differences in methods of normalization and the lack of a standardized definition of uti in patients with neurogenic bladders.",PMC6421595,PMC6421595_4
