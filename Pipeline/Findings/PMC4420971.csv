The study found that cloth masks should not be recommended for healthcare workers (HCWs) due to the significantly higher rates of infection compared to medical masks.,PMC4420971,PMC4420971_0
"The study also found that cloth masks may potentially cause an increase in infection risk for HCWs due to the poor filtration capacity, self-contamination through repeated use and improper doffing, and increased moisture retention.",PMC4420971,PMC4420971_1
"The study confirmed the protective effects of hand hygiene against laboratory-confirmed viral infection in this setting, but mask type was an independent predictor of clinical illness, even adjusted for hand hygiene.",PMC4420971,PMC4420971_2
"The study suggests that medical masks may be protective against respiratory infection, but the magnitude of difference raises the possibility that cloth masks cause an increase in infection risk for HCWs.",PMC4420971,PMC4420971_3
"The study recommends that infection control guidelines be updated about cloth mask use to protect the occupational health and safety of HCWs, as cloth masks should not be recommended, particularly during emergency, infectious/respiratory disease, and intensive care wards.",PMC4420971,PMC4420971_4
