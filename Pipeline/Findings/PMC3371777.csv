"According to a recent study, an estimated 9-42 US healthcare workers die annually from occupational infections and injuries, with 75-250 deaths resulting from hepatitis B virus infection, 500-150 deaths from hepatitis C virus infection, and 17-57 deaths from HIV infection.",PMC3371777,PMC3371777_0
"The risk of acquiring a work-related fatal infection represents a substantial risk to healthcare workers in developing countries, with reports from Africa, Ethiopia, and South Africa describing substantial rises in active cases of tuberculosis among healthcare workers, many of whom die of the disease.",PMC3371777,PMC3371777_1
"The current lack of a national tracking system for occupational deaths of healthcare workers may underestimate the actual occupational death rate for these diseases, as estimates for only four diseases were projected by relying on published prevalence, transmission rate, and natural history of these infections.",PMC3371777,PMC3371777_2
"A recent study estimated that 17-57 US healthcare workers per million employed die annually from occupational infections and injuries, with this finding standing in contrast to the rigorous approach used to track occupational deaths of various other workers, such as police officers and firefighters, who have a critical societal responsibility during national disasters.",PMC3371777,PMC3371777_3
"A nationwide tracking system for occupational deaths of healthcare workers will accomplish several important goals, including determining the magnitude of the problem, informing future interventions, and leading to appropriate financial compensation, as was invoked recently as the national smallpox vaccination plan was initiated due to healthcare worker reluctance to accept a vaccine known to cause fatal reactions.",PMC3371777,PMC3371777_4
