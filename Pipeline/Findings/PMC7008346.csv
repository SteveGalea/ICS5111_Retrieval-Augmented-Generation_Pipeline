The study found that less than 10% of patients presenting to primary care in Thailand with a sore throat and history of fever had Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) detected.,PMC7008346,PMC7008346_0
"The study revealed that clindamycin and erythromycin resistance was found in 2 out of 11 (18.2%) of the isolates, which is higher than reported resistance levels in some countries, such as the United States, Greece, and Iran.",PMC7008346,PMC7008346_1
"The study indicated that narrow-spectrum penicillin should remain the mainstay of treatment for Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) pharyngitis in Thailand, as well as elsewhere, given the current concern about the development of antibiotic resistance, largely fueled by overuse of antibiotics.",PMC7008346,PMC7008346_2
"The study found that using a throat swab for all patients is impractical in the Thai primary care setting, as the specificity of C-reactive protein (CRP) testing to identify pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) is poor as CRP can be raised in other infections and inflammatory processes.",PMC7008346,PMC7008346_3
"The study suggested that further validation of these indicators for antibiotic prescription for Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) pharyngitis in Thailand is required, given the limitations of the study, such as the small numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) isolates and the retrospective calculation of the centor and feverpain clinical scores.",PMC7008346,PMC7008346_4
"The study found that crp levels were higher in patients from whom Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) was isolated than in those without beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) isolation, and relying on crp testing alone would result in high levels of antibiotic prescription for sore throats in some settings.",PMC7008346,PMC7008346_5
"The study indicated that a combination of clinical scores and C-reactive protein (CRP) testing may offer the most practical and effective approach to ruling out Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) infection, given the limitations of the study, such as the small sample size and the retrospective calculation of the centor and feverpain clinical scores.",PMC7008346,PMC7008346_6
