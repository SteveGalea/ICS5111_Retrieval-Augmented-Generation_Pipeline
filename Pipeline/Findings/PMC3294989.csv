"During a respiratory outbreak surveillance in Ontario, Canada, from July to December 2009, 297 outbreaks were reported, and 174 (59%) were caused by human rhinovirus (HRV).",PMC3294989,PMC3294989_0
"Of the 4 outbreaks associated with deaths, 3 were caused by HRV-A and 1 by HRV-C.",PMC3294989,PMC3294989_1
"Multiplex molecular methods were crucial for rapid identification of the pathogens involved in these outbreaks, and the results were provided in a timely fashion for every outbreak.",PMC3294989,PMC3294989_2
"The study suggests a causal association between severe disease and HRV-C, but in the cases studied, most deaths were associated with HRV-A.",PMC3294989,PMC3294989_3
"Because the surveillance program had limitations in terms of epidemiologic data collection, a causal association between HRV and severe disease must be made cautiously, as viruses isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs may represent asymptomatic colonization or nonliving organisms.",PMC3294989,PMC3294989_4
