"In a pediatric stem cell transplant population, universal use of surgical masks by healthcare providers was associated with a greater than 50% reduction in nosocomial respiratory virus (RV) infection.",PMC6797241,PMC6797241_0
"In a rehabilitation setting, earlier initiation of transmission-based precautions for symptomatic patients, discouraging visitation by people with potentially infectious symptoms, and making it easier for staff to stay home when sick, significantly reduced the number of bed closure days due to RV outbreaks.",PMC6797241,PMC6797241_1
"In a pediatric population, nosocomial transmission of RVs was prevented through increased viral testing, but continued sporadic nosocomial transmission of RVs was observed despite improvement in infection prevention and control practices.",PMC6797241,PMC6797241_2
"In a pediatric population, limiting visits by children under the age of 12 during the winter months may reduce nosocomial transmission of viral respiratory infection.",PMC6797241,PMC6797241_3
"In the rehabilitation setting, despite the reduction in symptomatic visitation, either healthcare providers or visitors could have continued to transmit RVs through asymptomatic viral carriage.",PMC6797241,PMC6797241_4
