"A mathematical model developed by the authors shows that a transmissible vaccine, which allows infection transmission among hosts, can significantly facilitate efforts to control and eradicate infectious diseases, particularly in cases where the infectious disease is not excessively transmissive.",PMC5095390,PMC5095390_0
"The model reveals that the fractional reduction in vaccination effort required to eradicate an infectious disease increases with the r0 (basic reproductive number) of the vaccine and decreases with the r0 of the disease. This means that the closer the r0 of the vaccine to that of the disease, the greater the reduction in direct vaccination effort required for disease eradication.",PMC5095390,PMC5095390_1
"Even in cases where a transmissible vaccine does not allow an infectious disease to be eradicated, it can still significantly reduce disease incidence, particularly in cases where the infectious disease is not excessively transmissive.",PMC5095390,PMC5095390_2
"Simulations and numerical analyses show that under conditions where the model predicts a traditional, non-transmissible vaccine would fail to eradicate the disease, eradication occurred in only 2.4% of simulations. In cases where the model predicts vaccine transmission would reduce infection rates but fail to completely eradicate the disease, simulations showed vaccine transmission reduced the number of infected individuals by 61.8% relative to a non-transmissible vaccine and resulted in disease eradication in 39.2% of simulations.",PMC5095390,PMC5095390_3
"The models developed by the authors are simplifications designed to estimate the potential benefits of weakly transmissible vaccines. Further generalization to evaluate the more nuanced biology of real populations, including spatial structure, heterogeneities in host populations, imperfect vaccines, and vaccine and disease evolution, will ultimately be required to circumscribe the conditions under which transmissible vaccines will provide benefits that exceed their potential risks.",PMC5095390,PMC5095390_4
"The authors suggest that even weakly transmissible vaccines can facilitate efforts to control and eradicate infectious diseases and that these vaccines may provide a safe and effective tool in the battle against infectious disease, particularly in cases where direct vaccination of a significant portion of the population is excessively costly or even impossible in many cases.",PMC5095390,PMC5095390_5
"The authors suggest that the potential for evolutionary reversion to wild-type virulence outweighs the potential benefits of transmissible vaccines, but that new developments in",PMC5095390,PMC5095390_6
