"A synthetic plant virus, named fl-tmv-na, was created using a modular strategy to assemble its genome from short, overlapping DNA fragments.",PMC4072989,PMC4072989_0
"The synthetic virus was found to alter symptoms in both expected and unexpected ways in both the plant it was intended to infect and a related plant species, demonstrating the potential for synthetic biology to create new plant pathogens.",PMC4072989,PMC4072989_1
"The synthetic virus was also found to be benign to animals and the environment, as it was entirely funded by the USDA-ARS and did not contain any antibiotic resistance markers.",PMC4072989,PMC4072989_2
"Mass spectrometry analysis of proteins extracted from infected plants revealed the presence of viral peptides, and these peptides did not have equivalent or better matches in a database of plant protein records.",PMC4072989,PMC4072989_3
"The study highlights the importance of synthetic biology for creating new plant pathogens with desired properties, as well as the potential for synthetic biology to contribute to plant disease management and control by providing new tools for understanding plant virus evolution and spread.",PMC4072989,PMC4072989_4
