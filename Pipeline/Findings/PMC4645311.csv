"The study identified highly diverse bat coronaviruses (BtCoVs) belonging to the species Betacoronavirus 1, Alphacoronavirus 1, and Alphacoronavirus 2, including a previously unreported alphacoronavirus 2 in a captive alpaca from the United States. These viruses formed one species together with human coronavirus 229E (hCoV-229E), suggesting a long evolutionary history of hCoV-229E in old world hipposiderid bats that greatly exceeds that of hCoV-229E in humans. The study also identified BtCoVs in hipposiderid bats from Ghana, Nigeria, Thailand, and Gabon, separating these viruses from hCoV-229E in humans.",PMC4645311,PMC4645311_0
"The study found that BtCoVs in hipposiderid bats from Ghana, Nigeria, Thailand, and Gabon are genetically related to hCoV-229E in humans, indicating restriction of these viruses to hipposiderid bat genera. This finding supports previous hypotheses from the study group that the spike gene of hCoV-229E in humans is related to BtCoVs in hipposiderid bats.",PMC4645311,PMC4645311_1
"The study identified putative intraspike recombination events between BtCoVs in hipposiderid bats from Ghana and Nigeria, suggesting that recombination events may occur in BtCoVs in hipposiderid bats.",PMC4645311,PMC4645311_2
"The study found that a BtCoV in a captive alpaca from the United States contained an intact orf8, which was genetically related to the homologous gene in BtCoVs in hipposiderid bats and in hCoV-229E in humans. This finding suggests that alpacas may represent a first host switch from bats followed by a second interhost transfer from alpacas to humans, as the relatedness of the alpaca virus and other hCoV-229E strains is rather to old hCoV-229E strains reported by Crossley et al. (2012) than to contemporary ones reported by Zaki et al.",PMC4645311,PMC4645311_3
