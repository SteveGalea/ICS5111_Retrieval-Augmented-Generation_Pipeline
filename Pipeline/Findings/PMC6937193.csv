"This study, which used 16S rRNA pyrosequencing to analyze adenoid samples in patients with otitis media with and without adenoid hyperplasia, identified a difference in bacterial diversity and microbial composition between the two groups. The results suggest that changes in the microbiota may be associated with the development of otitis media.",PMC6937193,PMC6937193_0
"The microbial composition at the phylum level was slightly different between the two groups, with actinobacteria identified in the ome group as highly dominant only in one specimen (61.75%). This is noteworthy because actinobacteria are difficult to identify using conventional culture methods, and their roles in the human body have not yet been studied.",PMC6937193,PMC6937193_1
"The four dominant species in the ome group were strains that were rarely cultured in a traditional culture-based study, including Delftia, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. This is different from what was observed in a traditional culture-based study of adenoids.",PMC6937193,PMC6937193_2
"In addition, the non-dominant microbiomes detected in the adenoids of the control group varied from study to study, possibly due to differences in race and age, as well as environmental factors.",PMC6937193,PMC6937193_3
"The results of the sequence similarity-based analysis study, such as pcoa and upgma tree analysis, revealed differences in microbial composition between the ome and control groups. This provides basic data for identifying a new pathologic mechanism and will aid in the treatment of otitis media.",PMC6937193,PMC6937193_4
