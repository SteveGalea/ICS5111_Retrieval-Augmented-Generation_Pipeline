"The study compared the performance of Seeplex RV16, Seeplex RV15, and XTAG in the detection of respiratory viruses using 287 clinical specimens.",PMC3666760,PMC3666760_0
"All three methods showed good sensitivities for the detection of influenza A virus subtypes H1, H3, and H5, but XTAG had an advantage for the detection of H1 due to its ability to further detect H1, H3, and H5 virus subtypes.",PMC3666760,PMC3666760_1
"XTAG showed decreased sensitivity for coronavirus compared to Seeplex RV15 and Seeplex RV16, especially for the coronavirus strain OC43/NL63, as previously reported.",PMC3666760,PMC3666760_2
"Seeplex RV16 and Seeplex RV15 differentiated between respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus accurately, with no cross-reactivity between the two viruses.",PMC3666760,PMC3666760_3
"The study found that the sensitivity of Seeplex RV15 and Seeplex RV16 for respiratory syncytial virus could be improved, as the low sensitivity for RSVc could be associated with more severe clinical illnesses, including lower respiratory tract infections and asthmatic exacerbations, than RSVa and RSVb.",PMC3666760,PMC3666760_4
