"All five cases presented in the article closely resemble the noneffusive, granulomatous form of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in cats, with similar clinical signs and pathological findings.",PMC4681245,PMC4681245_0
"The distribution and nature of the lesions in these cases are reminiscent of those seen in chronic aleutian disease, a highly contagious parvovirus seen in minks and ferrets, but no acid-fast bacilli, fungal hyphae, or protozoa were identified.",PMC4681245,PMC4681245_1
"All five ferrets presented with hyperglobulinemia and positive immunoreactivity to fipv3-70 antibody, making a diagnosis of aleutian disease unlikely.",PMC4681245,PMC4681245_2
"Myofasciitis can have a similar clinical presentation, but it is not histologically comparable to FIP or frscv-associated disease.",PMC4681245,PMC4681245_3
"The route for transmission of frscv-associated disease is unknown, but it is suggested to be fecal-oral, similar to that for feline infectious peritonitis in cats, and measures aimed toward preventing the spread of the disease should be adapted from recommendations for the prevention of FIP in cats.",PMC4681245,PMC4681245_4
