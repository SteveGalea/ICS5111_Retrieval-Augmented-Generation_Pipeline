"In two familial case series, both presenting with rapidly progressing respiratory failure, the simultaneous development of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis in family members suggests the involvement of exposure to common environmental factors or viral infections.",PMC3378931,PMC3378931_0
The occurrence of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis only in spring and its familial pattern suggests that the development of this disease may be related to exposure to viruses or common inhaled environmental agents.,PMC3378931,PMC3378931_1
"Early diagnosis with lung biopsy and radiological examination, and early initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, are critical for improving the outcome in patients with unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis, as this disease has a poor prognosis.",PMC3378931,PMC3378931_2
"The lung biopsy specimens and radiological findings in these familial case series showed a pattern of spread from the south to north, and the detection of various viruses, providing evidence that viral infection may be associated with the development of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis in Korea.",PMC3378931,PMC3378931_3
"The pattern of spread of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis from the south to north in Korea, and its characteristic pattern of spread, suggest that the development of this disease may be related to exposure to common environmental factors or viral infections, as demonstrated in the two familial case series presented.",PMC3378931,PMC3378931_4
