The study revealed that the emergence and spread of drug-resistant influenza A(H3N2) viruses in humans is a complex process involving multiple introductions and subsequent clonal expansions in distinct geographic locations. This highlights the need for continued global surveillance of influenza virus antigenic and resistance characteristics to better understand the dynamics of antiviral drug resistance emergence and spread.,PMC2705899,PMC2705899_0
"The study identified distinct antigenic groups of influenza A(H3N2) viruses, with the emergence and subsequent spread of specific antigenic groups associated with the emergence and subsequent spread of drug resistance. This underscores the importance of considering antigenic and resistance characteristics simultaneously to better understand the interplay between antigenic drift and drug resistance evolution.",PMC2705899,PMC2705899_1
"The study found that the emergence of drug-resistant influenza A(H3N2) viruses is not a random process, but rather a highly structured one, with specific antigenic and resistance characteristics associated with specific clades on the phylogenetic tree. This suggests that the emergence and spread of drug-resistant influenza A(H3N2) viruses is not a stochastic process, but rather involves selective pressures.",PMC2705899,PMC2705899_2
"The study revealed that the emergence and spread of drug-resistant influenza A(H3N2) viruses in humans is a complex process involving multiple introductions and subsequent clonal expansions in distinct geographic locations, as well as ongoing antigenic drift. This underscores the importance of continued global surveillance of influenza virus antigenic and resistance characteristics to better understand the dynamics of antiviral drug resistance emergence and spread in the context of ongoing antigenic drift.",PMC2705899,PMC2705899_3
