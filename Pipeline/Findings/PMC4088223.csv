"The study of endothelial cells in vitro is complicated by their marked heterogeneity and tendency to lose tissue-specific markers when cultured. Many classical endothelial markers are widely expressed, and there is variability in detection of phenotypic markers between animal and human systems.",PMC4088223,PMC4088223_0
"The increasing knowledge of endothelial receptors is providing a larger and better defined set of phenotypic markers. Examples of this are the large number of scavenger receptors expressed by hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, which provide clues to specific functions of the cells being studied.",PMC4088223,PMC4088223_1
"The study of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (hsec) in vitro has been hampered by the lack of specific markers that can conclusively identify these cells and discriminate them from vascular or lymphatic endothelial cells. However, the increasing knowledge of endothelial receptors is providing us with a larger and better defined set of phenotypic markers.",PMC4088223,PMC4088223_2
"Cultured hsec do exhibit some useful identifying features, but these changes rapidly disappear within a passage or two in culture. Apart from these changes, the cells remain relatively phenotypically stable for 7-8 passages and can be identified by expression of cd31, lyve-1, dc-signr(l-sign), stabilin-1, and lack of cd34 and prox-1, which confirm endothelial identity while excluding vascular and lymphatic endothelial contamination and in conjunction with markers to exclude cells of leukocyte origin can be used to confirm the sinusoidal nature of the cells.",PMC4088223,PMC4088223_3
"The study of hsec in vitro has shown that the cells retain fenestrations in vitro for a short time but these rapidly disappear within a passage or two in culture, as does expression of vap-1. However, the cells remain relatively phenotypically stable for 7-8 passages. These findings highlight the challenges of studying hsec in vitro, but also suggest potential strategies for overcoming these challenges, such as the use of specific markers to confirm endothelial identity and the sinusoidal nature of the cells.",PMC4088223,PMC4088223_4
