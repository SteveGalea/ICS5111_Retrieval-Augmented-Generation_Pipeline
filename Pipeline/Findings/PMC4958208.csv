"A dendrimer family containing tryptophan (Trp) groups was found to have anti-enterovirus a71 (EV-A71) activity, with compound 12, a dendrimer with 12 Trp residons, being the most active (EC50 of 0.29 ÂµM).",PMC4958208,PMC4958208_0
"The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of this dendrimer family for anti-EV-A71 activity is similar to that for anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity, with multivalent presentation of Trp being important and the presence of 9 or 12 Trp residons on the periphery being sufficient.",PMC4958208,PMC4958208_1
"Compound 12 showed less pronounced antiviral activity against echovirus 11 (ECHO-11) and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), making it a specific inhibitor of EV-A71 replication.",PMC4958208,PMC4958208_2
"Compound 12 was 250- to 3,800-fold more potent against clinical EV-A71 isolates than against the reference strain, with EC50s in the low-nanomolar/high-picomolar range.",PMC4958208,PMC4958208_3
"Time-of-drug-addition studies indicated that compound 12, like the capsid binder pirodavir, inhibits EV-A71 entry, with clear inhibition of virus replication observed only when the drug was added during or before infection.",PMC4958208,PMC4958208_4
