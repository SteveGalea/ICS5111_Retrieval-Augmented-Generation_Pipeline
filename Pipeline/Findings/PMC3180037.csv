"Ape1, an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 crd RNase, cleaves rna without the presence of divalent metal ions and prefers to cleave 3' of pyrimidines at ua, ug, and ca sites, especially in single-stranded regions or weakly paired regions of rna.",PMC3180037,PMC3180037_0
"Ape1 cleaves rna in the presence of ca2+ ions, which are known as potent splicing enhancers/silencers, suggesting a possible role for ape1 in mRNA splicing.",PMC3180037,PMC3180037_1
"Pre-treatment of pre-mirnas with ape1 significantly reduces the ability of dicer to process these substrates in vitro, providing another dimension in which ape1 could potentially influence the biogenesis and hence the level of mirnas in cells.",PMC3180037,PMC3180037_2
"Ape1 cleaves any rna when presented in vitro and weakly cleaves at uc, cu, ac, and au sites, although the likelihood of such specificity is low and it is likely that ape1-rna interaction is more tolerant towards different nucleotides than its interaction with an abasic dna.",PMC3180037,PMC3180037_3
"Since all rna molecules tested possess bases, the likelihood of such specificity is low and it is likely that ape1-rna interaction is more tolerant towards different nucleotides than its interaction with an abasic dna, insights from the example of RNase A in recognition of its substrate, RNA, suggest that Ape1 cleaves only on the single-stranded regions or weakly paired regions of RNA.",PMC3180037,PMC3180037_4
