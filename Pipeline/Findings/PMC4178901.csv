"The present study reports for the first time that the metalloprotease adam17 helps regulate prrsv entry in vitro and that adam17 downregulates the expression level of membrane cd163, which is a prrsv major receptor, from the surface of prrsv permissive cells such as marc-145 and pam.",PMC4178901,PMC4178901_0
The study shows that adam17 activity reduces prrsv infection at the stage of viral entry rather than any other stage of viral life cycle.,PMC4178901,PMC4178901_1
"The findings indicate that, in addition to contributing to cell activation and apoptosis, adam17 is also involved in resistance to prrsv infection.",PMC4178901,PMC4178901_2
The study suggests that the modification of adam17 activity affects prrsv entry by shifting the cd163 expression level on the marc-145 cell surface.,PMC4178901,PMC4178901_3
"The findings indicate that because a previous report showed that cd163 expression level decreases upon prrsv infection, it seems that adam17 activity is directly stimulated by viral infection, and that adam17 downregulates cd163, the putative receptor of prrsv, and thereby suppresses prrsv entry.",PMC4178901,PMC4178901_4
