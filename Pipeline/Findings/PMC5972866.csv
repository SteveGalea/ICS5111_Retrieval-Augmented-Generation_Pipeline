"In this study, the complete genome sequence of rmva 51.1 was determined and deposited in GenBank. This finding provides a valuable resource for further research into the biology and pathogenesis of cowpox virus.",PMC5972866,PMC5972866_0
"The study identified two genes, b18r and c5, that are essential for viral replication and host cell survival. Deletion of either gene resulted in a complete loss of infectious virus and host cell death. These findings shed light on the role of these genes in the viral replication process and host cell interactions.",PMC5972866,PMC5972866_1
"The study also identified a third gene, m1, that is dispensable for viral replication but is required for viral spread. The authors propose that m1 may have a role in host cell signaling or immune response.",PMC5972866,PMC5972866_2
"The study revealed that the 68k-ank gene, which is essential for viral replication and host cell survival, is not required for host cell survival in the absence of viral replication. This finding suggests that the 68k-ank protein may have a direct role in viral replication or may be involved in a viral-induced cellular response that is distinct from host cell survival.",PMC5972866,PMC5972866_3
"The study also found that the viral cores, which contain the viral genome, are located in the cytoplasm of infected cells. This finding provides insight into the mechanism of viral replication and the localization of viral replication structures within host cells.",PMC5972866,PMC5972866_4
