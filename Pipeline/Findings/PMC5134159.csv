Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis that primarily affects children under the age of 5 years.,PMC5134159,PMC5134159_0
"KD is now the most common vasculitis disorder in children, and is being increasingly recognized in several centers across India.",PMC5134159,PMC5134159_1
"KD presents with rash and fever that persists for 5 days or more, and is often misdiagnosed as viral exanthemas or infectious mononucleosis.",PMC5134159,PMC5134159_2
"KD can impact the cardiovascular system in several different ways, including the development of coronary artery lesions (CALS) and giant aneurysms, which may manifest clinically as arrhythmias, congestive cardiac failure, and myocardial ischemia.",PMC5134159,PMC5134159_3
"The risk of development of CALS can be brought down to less than 3% if the condition is diagnosed in time and treated appropriately, and regular echocardiographic evaluation is mandatory for all children with KD, irrespective of whether or not they have CALS.",PMC5134159,PMC5134159_4
