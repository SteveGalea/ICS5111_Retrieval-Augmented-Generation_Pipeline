"The study found that the neurotropic virus jhmv, a strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), can infect and replicate in primary cultures of glial cells, including oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), astrocytes, and microglia.",PMC2779567,PMC2779567_0
"The study also demonstrated that jhmv can impair differentiation of OPCCs, as seen by reduced expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and reduced number of cells with a galactocerebroside (GC) lipid biomarker, both of which are indicative of mature OPCCs.",PMC2779567,PMC2779567_1
"The study further revealed that the viral nucleocapsid protein (N) of jhmv can be detected in OPCC cultures using an immunoperoxidase staining assay, and that the levels of interferon (IFN) beta (IFNβ), a type I IFN, can be measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on inhibition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) growth in L929 cells.",PMC2779567,PMC2779567_2
"The study also found that recombinant mouse IFNα and IFNγ can significantly reduce the levels of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 in OPCC cultures, suggesting a role for these cytokines in jhmv-induced inflammation and immune response in glial cells.",PMC2779567,PMC2779567_3
"The study used viral infection and viral titer assays to further investigate the replication and pathogenesis of jhmv in OPCCs and other glial cell types, as well as the potential for differentiation impairment and inflammatory responses in these cells.",PMC2779567,PMC2779567_4
