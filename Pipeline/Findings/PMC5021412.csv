"The study identified imatinib, a drug initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to target the Bcr-Abl protein in leukemia, as a potent inhibitor of replication of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses.",PMC5021412,PMC5021412_0
"The study found that imatinib inhibited the early stages of the viral life cycle for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, suggesting that imatinib exerts its action after viral entry but prior to viral genome replication.",PMC5021412,PMC5021412_1
"The study demonstrated that an siRNA-mediated knockdown of the Abl2 protein, but not Abl1, resulted in a decrease in virus replication for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, suggesting that the Abl2 protein is required for efficient virus replication.",PMC5021412,PMC5021412_2
The study identified Abl2 as a novel host cell protein involved in coronavirus virion replication and hypothesized that Abl2 is required for virion fusion at the endosomal membrane by a mechanism that is under investigation.,PMC5021412,PMC5021412_3
"The study found that treatment with imatinib, even though Abl2 is in its open, active conformation, prevented phosphorylation of downstream targets, as ATP is unable to bind in the active site, and as a consequence, the kinase activity of Abl2 is inhibited, preventing phosphorylation of proteins targeted by Abl2.",PMC5021412,PMC5021412_4
