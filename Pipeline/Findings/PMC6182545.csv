"The study found a high prevalence of respiratory pathogens in children presenting with acute respiratory illness, with rhinovirus being the most commonly detected agent followed by respiratory syncytial virus.",PMC6182545,PMC6182545_0
"Co-infection with multiple pathogens, including viral and bacterial agents, is common in children with acute respiratory tract infection.",PMC6182545,PMC6182545_1
"The study highlighted the need for early diagnosis and management of respiratory tract infection, as most causative agents are viral and excessive use of antibiotics has caused rising bacterial resistance.",PMC6182545,PMC6182545_2
"The study emphasized the importance of molecular methods, such as multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction, in identifying many causative agents, which reduces the excessive use of antibiotics and helps fill the gap between clinical presentation and definitive diagnosis.",PMC6182545,PMC6182545_3
"The study suggested that a new management strategy for respiratory tract infection should be developed based on the emerging trend of co-infection with multiple pathogens, with a large-scale multicenter study recommended to address the epidemiological gap.",PMC6182545,PMC6182545_4
