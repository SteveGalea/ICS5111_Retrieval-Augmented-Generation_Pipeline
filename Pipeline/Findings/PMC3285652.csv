"This study demonstrates the feasibility of using portable, inexpensive, non-instrumented nucleic acid (nina) heaters for amplification of HIV-1 using RT-lamp.",PMC3285652,PMC3285652_0
"The authors describe the use of reaction tubes pre-prepared with lyophilized reaction mix, which reduces hands-on time and preparation error and eliminates the need for a time-consuming, nucleic acid extraction procedure.",PMC3285652,PMC3285652_1
The authors demonstrate no difference in the temperature stability of the nina heaters and amplification consistency at an ambient temperature of 37Â°C as compared to a temperature-controlled laboratory.,PMC3285652,PMC3285652_2
"The authors demonstrate the use of the nina heaters for amplification directly from whole blood specimens, which eliminates the need for a time-consuming, nucleic acid extraction procedure and reduces the volume of sample needed for the amplification reaction.",PMC3285652,PMC3285652_3
"The authors demonstrate immediate visualization of amplified products in the absence of specialized equipment by using a simple, inexpensive keychain light as the UV source.",PMC3285652,PMC3285652_4
