"The study identified a high seroprevalence of West Nile virus (WNV) in California condors, with 61% of free-flying condors, 7.1% of condors housed at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park (SDZSP), and no evidence of exposure in turkey vultures or golden eagles. The study also found that release location and rearing site were associated with WNV serostatus in free-flying condors, with birds from southern California being the most likely to be seropositive for WNV.",PMC4659623,PMC4659623_0
"The study found that California condors had a high seroprevalence for avian adenovirus, with 32% of free-flying condors, 42% of turkey vultures, and 76% of golden eagles being seropositive. The study also found that isolation and characterization of avian adenoviruses from captive condors and house finches at the zoo are needed to better understand potential disease transmission between these species.",PMC4659623,PMC4659623_1
"The study found that California condors had a relatively low seroprevalence for avian paramyxovirus type 2 (APMV-2), with a seroprevalence of 59% in condors housed at the Sdzsp, and only a single free-flying condor being seropositive for APMV-2, while no evidence of exposure was found in turkey vultures, golden eagles, or condors housed at the laz. The study also found that further investigation is needed to determine the significance of these findings and reasons for the differences in seroprevalence of APMV-2, Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), and WNV between the two captive populations.",PMC4659623,PMC4659623_2
"The study found that 61% of free-flying California condors were seropositive for WNV, while in the multivariable logistic regression model, release location and rearing site were associated with WNV serostatus in free-flying condors, while previous vaccination for WNV was not predictive of serologic status. The study also found that older condors are more likely to be seropositive for WNV as a result of strong antibody responses to WNV upon",PMC4659623,PMC4659623_3
