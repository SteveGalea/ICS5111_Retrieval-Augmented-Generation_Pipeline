"The 7a protein, encoded by the sars-cov virus, inhibits cellular protein synthesis and activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.",PMC1346853,PMC1346853_0
"Expression of the 7a protein in cells causes an increase in activated p38 MAPK, indicating that it may contribute to cytopathogenesis of sars-cov.",PMC1346853,PMC1346853_1
"The 7a protein is likely to activate pro- or antiapoptotic golgi proteins, which may result in the promotion of apoptosis.",PMC1346853,PMC1346853_2
"The sars-cov virus may encode additional proteins that inhibit cellular translation, in addition to the 7a protein.",PMC1346853,PMC1346853_3
"The mechanism of apoptosis induced by the sars-cov virus is yet to be determined, but the data presented suggest that the sars-cov 7a protein inhibits translation and activates p38 MAPK.",PMC1346853,PMC1346853_4
