"The paper reports the development of simple, accurate, and sensitive np- and rp-hptlc methods for the quantification of four antiviral biomarkers, rutin, quercetin, naringenin, and gallic acid, in Guiera senegalensis (gssee), which supports their possible role in the inhibition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expressions and DNA replication.",PMC6130481,PMC6130481_0
"The paper demonstrates that g. Senegalensis leaves contain antiviral biomarkers, including gallic acid (7.01 μg/mg), the most abundant antiviral biomarker compared to rutin (2.42 μg/mg), quercetin (1.53 μg/mg), and naringenin (0.14 μg/mg) in g. Senegalensis leaves, which is the first report of its kind.",PMC6130481,PMC6130481_1
"The paper highlights that g. Senegalensis leaves contain antiviral biomarkers, including quercetin, which has been reported to have antiviral potential against enveloped viruses, such as meningovirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV1), parainfluenza type 3, pseudorabies virus, respiratory syncytial virus, sindbis virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).",PMC6130481,PMC6130481_2
"The paper reveals that g. Senegalensis leaves contain antiviral biomarkers, including naringenin, which has been reported to have antiviral potential against human cytomegalovirus (HCV), and highlights the importance of addressing the issue of the effectiveness of these biomarkers against HBV and HCV, as HBV and HCV share some common inhibitory mechanisms, either targeting viral envelopes or reverse transcriptases.",PMC6130481,PMC6130481_3
The paper underscores that the developed np- and rp-hptlc methods could be employed in the standardization and quality control of herbal preparations containing therapeutic biomarkers.,PMC6130481,PMC6130481_4
