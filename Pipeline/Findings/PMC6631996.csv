"A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that a synthetic dna vaccine targeting human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18, delivered by electroporation into mice, elicited significant humoral and cellular immune responses. The study also showed that the vaccine induced protective immunity against HPV-driven cancer challenges in mice.",PMC6631996,PMC6631996_0
"The study showed that the vaccine induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses against HPV 16 and 18, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry, respectively. The vaccine also induced protective immunity against HPV-driven cancer challenges in mice.",PMC6631996,PMC6631996_1
"The study showed that the synthetic dna vaccine induced significant humoral and cellular immune responses against HPV 16 and 18, as measured by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. The vaccine also induced protective immunity against HPV-driven cancer challenges in mice, suggesting its potential as a novel approach for HPV immunotherapy.",PMC6631996,PMC6631996_2
"The study showed that the synthetic dna vaccine induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses against HPV 16 and 18, as measured by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. The vaccine also induced protective immunity against HPV-driven cancer challenges in mice, suggesting that this synthetic dna vaccine approach could be further developed for clinical studies.",PMC6631996,PMC6631996_3
"A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI) reported that a novel synthetic dna vaccine targeting the major human papillomavirus (HPV) latent oncoproteins, delivered by electroporation into mice, elicited significant humoral and cellular immune responses. The study also showed that the vaccine induced protective immunity against HPV-driven cancer challenges in mice.",PMC6631996,PMC6631996_4
