The study involved 14 laboratories from around the world and included a panel of 29 serum samples from patients with confirmed mers-cov infection.,PMC6759245,PMC6759245_0
"All laboratories correctly identified the negative samples, including those containing antibodies against other coronaviruses, implying good specificity of the assays.",PMC6759245,PMC6759245_1
The use of a reference material in the assays reduced the variation in results between laboratories and improved comparability of the data.,PMC6759245,PMC6759245_2
The study highlighted the importance of understanding whether there is a specific window of time in which clinical samples for serology should be taken or whether some patients do not mount a detectable antibody response against the spike protein during infection.,PMC6759245,PMC6759245_3
The study demonstrated the importance of using a standard for mers-cov serology to allow better comparison of results from different laboratories or interpretation of results from different studies or clinical trials.,PMC6759245,PMC6759245_4
