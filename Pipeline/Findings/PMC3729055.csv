The China Infectious Diseases Automated-Alert and Response System (CIDARS) was developed based on the existing data from the China National Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting System (NIDARS) on 28 infectious diseases that are outbreak-prone and require prompt action.,PMC3729055,PMC3729055_0
"CIDARS integrates multiple aberration detection methods, including the fixed-threshold detection method (FDM) for type 1 diseases, the temporal detection method (TDM) for type 2 diseases, and the spatial detection method (SDM) for type 2 diseases.",PMC3729055,PMC3729055_1
CIDARS conducts real-time and daily analysis on the data and sends abnormal signals to county-level CDCs through short message service (SMS) using mobile phones.,PMC3729055,PMC3729055_2
"CIDARS has been integrated into the routine work of local CDCs, and local epidemiologists use their existing mobile phones and computers to receive, review, and respond to the signals.",PMC3729055,PMC3729055_3
"CIDARS has been used to quickly detect and respond to outbreaks, including nine type 1 diseases characterized by higher severity but lower incidence, and more common type 2 diseases, and has generated a low percentage of possible positive signals, causing unnecessary signal response for local staff.",PMC3729055,PMC3729055_4
"CIDARS has been integrated into the China National Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting System (NIDARS), and the performance of outbreak detection can be improved by developing and calibrating more flexible and reasonable algorithms and parameters for aberration detection based on the different characteristics of particular diseases and various needs of different areas.",PMC3729055,PMC3729055_5
"CIDARS has been used to detect outbreaks before the cases are diagnosed and reported by clinicians because it is based on the notifiable infectious disease surveillance data, but it sometimes may be less timely and sensitive than some other outbreak detection systems using data on pre-diagnosis of cases in hospitals, media reports, or school absenteeism.",PMC3729055,PMC3729055_6
"CIDARS has been used to detect outbreaks in more than 6,000 system users, but some limitations, such as user management and training due to staff turnover, should be considered for improvement in the future.",PMC3729055,PMC3729055_7
"CIDARS has been used to quickly detect and respond to outbreaks, but more systematic evaluations of the performance of the system",PMC3729055,PMC3729055_8
