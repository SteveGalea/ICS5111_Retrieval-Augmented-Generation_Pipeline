"In the section discussing antimicrobial resistance in three countries, China, Kuwait, and the United States, the authors found that while resistance rates in China and Kuwait are strongly correlated, indicating a domestic origin of resistance problems, the correlation between China and the United States is weaker, suggesting that resistance problems in these countries are more independent.",PMC1502134,PMC1502134_0
"The authors also noted that in all three countries, resistance rates for certain bacterial-antibiotic pairs are increasing, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in China and Kuwait, as well as ceftriaxone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) in the United States.",PMC1502134,PMC1502134_1
"The authors highlighted that in Kuwait, the prevalence of resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC) in Shigella spp is particularly high, with nearly 100% resistance to this antibiotic observed in 2001.",PMC1502134,PMC1502134_2
"The authors also noted that while resistance to ceftriaxone in Shigella spp is high in China, it is lower in Kuwait, suggesting that Kuwait's resistance problem is more severe.",PMC1502134,PMC1502134_3
"The authors pointed out that while resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQs) is increasing in the United States, it is still lower than in other countries, such as Greece and Cyprus, where resistance to FQs is nearly ubiquitous.",PMC1502134,PMC1502134_4
