"The study found that the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in T-cells is associated with the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the viral genome, which is a critical step in the viral replication process.",PMC4103063,PMC4103063_0
"The study also identified a novel role for the HIV-1 accessory protein, Vpr, in the regulation of DSB repair. Vpr was found to promote the recruitment of a DSB repair protein, Xrcc1, to the viral genome, which enhances the repair of DSBs and facilitates viral replication.",PMC4103063,PMC4103063_1
"The study further revealed that the viral protein, Gag, is required for the recruitment of Xrcc1 to the viral genome, and that this recruitment is mediated by a direct interaction between Gag and Xrcc1.",PMC4103063,PMC4103063_2
"The study also provided evidence for the existence of a viral DNA intermediate in the replication process, which is a crucial step in the formation of new viral genomes.",PMC4103063,PMC4103063_3
"The findings suggest that the DSB repair pathway is a critical target for antiviral therapy, and that the regulation of this pathway by Vpr and Gag could provide new avenues for the development of novel antiviral strategies.",PMC4103063,PMC4103063_4
