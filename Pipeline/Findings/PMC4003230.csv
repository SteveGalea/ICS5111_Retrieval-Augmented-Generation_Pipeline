This study demonstrates that autophagy is involved in the hyperinduction of cxcl10 and ifn-α during h9n2/g1 influenza virus infection in human macrophages.,PMC4003230,PMC4003230_0
"The study shows that h9n2/g1 virus, which shares six internal genes with the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus, induces cxcl10 and ifn-α levels similar to h5n1 but not with s-oiv, a well-known avian influenza virus.",PMC4003230,PMC4003230_1
"The study reveals that h9n2/g1 virus induces a higher level of autophagy when compared to h1n1 and s-oiv, and that autophagy contributes, at least in part, to the hyperinduction of cxcl10 and ifn-α during h9n2/g1 infection.",PMC4003230,PMC4003230_2
"The study highlights the importance of tissue origins and cell types in autophagic responses, as blocking autophagy by knocking down atg5 had no effect on h9n2/g1 virus replication in primary human blood macrophages, while it enhanced the replication of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus in embryonic stem cells.",PMC4003230,PMC4003230_3
"The study provides evidence for the differential induction of cxcl10 and ifn-α by h9n2 and h1n1, and demonstrates the cell type-specific role of autophagy in virus replication, as autophagy enhances the replication of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus in embryonic stem cells, but atg5 knockdown had no effect on mouse hepatitis virus replication in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages and primary low-passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts.",PMC4003230,PMC4003230_4
