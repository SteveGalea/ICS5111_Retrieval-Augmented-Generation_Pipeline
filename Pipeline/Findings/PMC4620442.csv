The authors demonstrated that residues 100 and 101 primarily determine avian metapneu-movirus (AMPV) f protein-mediated cell-cell fusion in the absence of trypsin.,PMC4620442,PMC4620442_0
The authors found that residue 294g influences AMPV f protein-mediated cell-cell fusion in a low ph-dependent manner.,PMC4620442,PMC4620442_1
"The authors showed that AMPV f protein-mediated cell-cell fusion is stimulated by trypsin in a low ph environment, while fusion is inhibited in a neutral ph environment.",PMC4620442,PMC4620442_2
The authors determined that residues 100k101a and 100r101r in AMPV f protein from the Colorado strain (Colorado/97 strain) have a higher fusogenic activity compared to those from the A strain (LAH A strain) and the B strain (Vco3/60616 strain).,PMC4620442,PMC4620442_3
"The authors found that the fusion extent and expression level of AMPV f protein are determined by residues 100, 101, and 294 in AMPV f protein.",PMC4620442,PMC4620442_4
