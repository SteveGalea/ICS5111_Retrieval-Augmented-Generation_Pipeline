Symptom profile distributions for influenza and non-influenza cases were proposed to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the distribution of symptom profiles for influenza and non-influenza cases using data from a survey. These symptom profile distributions were examined through simulations in Section S3.,PMC3160845,PMC3160845_0
"The proposed method assumes that while the overall distribution for symptomatic non-influenza cases may not change significantly during different time periods, the distribution of symptom profiles for influenza cases may change due to an influenza outbreak with ""atypical"" symptoms, and this group is correlated with a weaker presentation of symptoms during different time periods. Therefore, a large non-influenza outbreak with ""atypical"" symptoms may still be robust due to a relatively small sample size in Section S2.",PMC3160845,PMC3160845_1
"The accuracy of the estimation of the distribution of symptom profiles for influenza and non-influenza cases using data from a survey is sensitive to the ability to accurately estimate the distribution of symptom profiles for non-influenza cases due to the fact that there are many more symptomatic non-influenza cases compared to the number of symptomatic influenza cases in a survey, and a misattribution of a certain percentage of non-influenza cases to influenza is magnified relative to the flu data due to the high flu circulation during different time periods.",PMC3160845,PMC3160845_2
"The proposed method assumes that since the distribution of symptom profiles for influenza cases may be different from the overall distribution for symptomatic non-influenza cases during different time periods, a larger non-influenza outbreak with ""atypical"" symptoms may still be robust due to a relatively small sample size in Section S2.",PMC3160845,PMC3160845_3
"The proposed method suggests including this agent into the list of infections whose incidence is estimated through the deconvolution process in Section S3, where a large non-influenza outbreak with ""atypical"" symptoms is added as an unobserved component. Alternatively, one may stick with flu and symptomatic non-influenza cases as the two infectious profiles and use the excess fever approach (symptom profile given by equation (2b)) in Section S2.",PMC3160845,PMC3160845_4
"The latter may still be robust due to a relatively small sample size in Section S2, where no statistically significant difference could be detected for the small sample of cases",PMC3160845,PMC3160845_5
