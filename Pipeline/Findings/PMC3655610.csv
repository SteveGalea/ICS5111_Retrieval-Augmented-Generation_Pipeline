"The study identified a new class of peptide-based antigens, termed ""conditional ligands,"" which can be used to stabilize human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.",PMC3655610,PMC3655610_0
"These conditional ligands are synthesized by replacing a single amino acid with a photocleavable moiety, which can be activated by ultraviolet (UV) light to release the peptide and expose the HLA binding site.",PMC3655610,PMC3655610_1
"The study demonstrated that these conditional ligands can be used to selectively label HLA molecules from various HLA-matched volunteers, as well as to identify antigen-specific T cell lines.",PMC3655610,PMC3655610_2
"In addition, the study found that the stability of HLA molecules can be assessed using a HLA-stability ELISA, which allows for the identification of peptides capable of stabilizing the corresponding HLA.",PMC3655610,PMC3655610_3
"The study also identified several known cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes that can be used in conjunction with these conditional ligands for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, including peptides derived from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV).",PMC3655610,PMC3655610_4
