"A study on adult respiratory viral infections found that the rate of fever in laboratory-confirmed cases was lower compared to children, with only 23.1% of influenza cases and 40.5% of other respiratory viral infections presenting with fever. This suggests that for rapid treatment and reducing the risk of transmission of infection, clinicians should be aware that a diagnosis of viral respiratory infection, even influenza, is possible in the absence of fever.",PMC5197931,PMC5197931_0
"The study also found that smoking was a significant predictor of fever, with smokers around five times more likely to have fever compared to non-smokers. This highlights the need for further epidemiological and clinical studies to explore the possible mechanisms behind this finding.",PMC5197931,PMC5197931_1
"The study found that co-infection with more than one virus was the strongest predictor of fever for adults with confirmed viral respiratory infections. This highlights the need for clinicians to consider the possibility of co-infection if a patient presents with fever, as co-infection cases are associated with higher rates of hospitalization and ICU admission.",PMC5197931,PMC5197931_2
"The study found that rates of fever in co-infection cases were higher compared to single viral infection. This highlights the possible increased severity of symptoms in co-infection cases, which could be due to an altered immune response associated with co-infection.",PMC5197931,PMC5197931_3
"The study found that the rate of fever in chinese hcws was lower compared to vietnamese hcws. This highlights the need for further epidemiological studies to explore the possible reasons behind this finding, as it could be due to differences in circulating viruses (and their pyrogenicity) between the two countries when the studies were conducted.",PMC5197931,PMC5197931_4
