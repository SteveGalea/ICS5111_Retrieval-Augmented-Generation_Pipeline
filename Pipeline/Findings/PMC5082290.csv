"Spautin-1, a small molecule with potential therapeutic effects in antiviral infection and cancer therapy, was shown to effectively inhibit impaired autophagy and reverse increased cytosolic calcium levels in pancreatic acinar cells upon cerulein or l-arginine treatment, both being characteristics of acute pancreatitis.",PMC5082290,PMC5082290_0
"In pancreatic acinar cells upon cerulein or l-arginine treatment, the increased level of impaired autophagy was mainly due to the inhibition of autophagy flux, while the change of autophagy flux positive regulator Beclin1 was minor.",PMC5082290,PMC5082290_1
"In pancreatic acinar cells upon cerulein or l-arginine treatment, protein aggregate accumulation as the result of autophagy blockade caused more trypsinogen activation, which was alleviated by spautin-1 due to its potential to promote the transformation of ubiquitated protein aggregates to soluble form.",PMC5082290,PMC5082290_2
"In pancreatic acinar cells upon cerulein or l-arginine treatment, spautin-1 was shown to reverse increased cytosolic calcium overload, which is a well-known characteristic of acute pancreatitis, as the phosphorylation of Camkii, which is indicative of an elevated level of cytosolic calcium in pancreatic acinar cells, could be considered to be a marker of this overload.",PMC5082290,PMC5082290_3
"In pancreatic acinar cells upon cerulein or l-arginine treatment, the increased level of impaired autophagy was partly due to calcium overload, as was reported in the case of liver injury caused by a high fat diet, which could be reversed by verapamil, a calcium channel blocker.",PMC5082290,PMC5082290_4
