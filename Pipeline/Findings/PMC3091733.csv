"The PathogenID V2.0 microarray demonstrated its ability to type and subtype influenza viruses with a minimum number of tiled sequences and to provide additional information close to the individual variant level, as shown by the identification and subtyping of avian influenza strains by the microarray, where consensus sequences were designed based upon global alignments of this large number of influenza virus sequences available in databanks. Median analysis was also performed to determine the time of emergence of the sample strain, as demonstrated by the study on the last novel h1n1pdm virus responsible for 2009 influenza pandemic.",PMC3091733,PMC3091733_0
"The PathogenID V2.0 microarray was able to detect a re-emerging influenza virus strain, as shown by the study on the last novel h1n1pdm virus responsible for 2009 influenza pandemic, where the first sequence(s) showing the highest scores were also detailed in Table 3.",PMC3091733,PMC3091733_1
"The PathogenID V2.0 microarray allowed for detection of a new virus, as shown by the study on the last novel h1n1pdm virus responsible for 2009 influenza pandemic, where median analysis was performed on the 100 first sequences only.",PMC3091733,PMC3091733_2
"The PathogenID V2.0 microarray was able to determine the segment origin for virus samples after hybridisation to the dna microarray, as shown by the study on the last novel h1n1pdm virus responsible for 2009 influenza pandemic, where median analysis was performed as described above.",PMC3091733,PMC3091733_3
"The PathogenID V2.0 microarray should also be able to detect a re-emerging influenza virus strain, as shown by the study on the last novel h1n1pdm virus responsible for 2009 influenza pandemic, where oligonucleotides specific for each tiled influenza virus gene were designed and used in RT-PCR assays.",PMC3091733,PMC3091733_4
"The PathogenID V2.0 microarray demonstrated its ability to provide additional information close to the individual variant level, as shown by the study on the last novel h1n1pdm virus responsible for 2009 influenza pandemic, where sequences of influenza virus genes were obtained from 3 individual clones for each gene.",PMC3091733,PMC3091733_5
