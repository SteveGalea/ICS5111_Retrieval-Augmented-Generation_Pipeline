"The established hs-gc-ms method for testing 1,4-dioxane in plga/tcp porous scaffolds is validated to meet the requirements in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015 edition, providing a residual 1,4-dioxane test method for plga/tcp scaffolds during CFDA registration.",PMC5894362,PMC5894362_0
"The method overcomes the matrix effect in the drying process of scaffolds by using dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent for extraction, which eliminates the effect of the porous structure in the scaffolds.",PMC5894362,PMC5894362_1
"The method is used to optimize the drying process of scaffolds to satisfy the product requirement, which is an important tool for quality control of composite scaffolds.",PMC5894362,PMC5894362_2
"The study detects chloroform in some batches of plga raw material from different suppliers, indicating the need for a specifically tuned gc-ms method for each target solvent to meet the requirements of method validation.",PMC5894362,PMC5894362_3
"The study shows that the conditions of −50°C and 50 Pa for lyophilizing are not efficient for removing 1,4-dioxane because, in this environment, 1,4-dioxane prefers solid rather than gas.",PMC5894362,PMC5894362_4
