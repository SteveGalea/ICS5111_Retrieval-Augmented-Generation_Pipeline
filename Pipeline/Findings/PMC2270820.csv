The study identified a contemporary human parechovirus type 1 (HPeV1) strain through vidisca virus discovery CDNA amplification fragment length polymorphism analysis.,PMC2270820,PMC2270820_0
Phylogenetic analysis and recombination analysis revealed evidence of recombination between type 3 nonstructural protein genes and type 1 structural protein genes in the identified HPeV1 strain.,PMC2270820,PMC2270820_1
"The study found that the non-structural protein genes of the identified HPeV1 strain and of prototype HPeV3 strains are not co-segregating, which highlights the lack of knowledge on the genesis and ecology of human parechoviruses.",PMC2270820,PMC2270820_2
The study confirmed that the 5'-noncoding region of the identified HPeV1 strain has likely been acquired from an hPEV4 strain.,PMC2270820,PMC2270820_3
"The study identified a breakpoint at the border between structural and nonstructural genes in the identified HPeV1 strain, suggesting a potential recombination event between type 3 nonstructural protein genes and type 1 structural protein genes.",PMC2270820,PMC2270820_4
