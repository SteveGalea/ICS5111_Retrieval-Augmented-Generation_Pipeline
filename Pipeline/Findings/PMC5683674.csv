"A good correlation between granulocyte and neutrophil counts was observed, with a linear regression line almost identical to the line of identity.",PMC5683674,PMC5683674_0
"The study identified that if using granulocyte count to indicate a neutrophil result is less than 1.0 × 109/l, the best performing granulocyte count in terms of balancing false negatives with false positives would be <1.13 × 109/l, but in order to obtain no false negative results, a significantly higher threshold needs to be used.",PMC5683674,PMC5683674_1
"The study found that the granulocyte count warrants further consideration as a surrogate indicator of neutrophil count, and could be used to indicate the ctcae grade of neutropenia.",PMC5683674,PMC5683674_2
"The study suggested that, if point-of-care systems are to be considered for monitoring patients on chemotherapy away from the hospital setting, then the relationship between the granulocyte and neutrophil count must be established using the technologies that will be used in routine practice.",PMC5683674,PMC5683674_3
"The study concluded that, if point-of-care, using a three-part differential white count, is to be considered for monitoring patients on chemotherapy away from the hospital setting, then the relationship between the granulocyte and neutrophil count cannot be assumed to be applicable to laboratory analysers employing different detection methodologies or to poct systems.",PMC5683674,PMC5683674_4
