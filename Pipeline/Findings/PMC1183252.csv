The study analyzed viral rna isolated directly from 8 clinical samples of patients confirmed with SARS-CoV infection.,PMC1183252,PMC1183252_0
"The study found evidence of a heterogeneous population of subgenomic RNA 3 (sgRNA3) transcripts in these patients, carrying 6 to 10 thymine (T) residues in an internal oligo(T) tract in the 3a gene.",PMC1183252,PMC1183252_1
"The study showed that different variants of the 3a gene exist in the viruses that were replicating in these patients, and the percentage of the different mutant transcripts varied considerably from patient to patient.",PMC1183252,PMC1183252_2
"The study found that in 6 out of the 8 patients, more than 50% of the sgRNA3 transcripts contained either 6Ts or 9Ts, indicating that the full-length 3a protein (or with 1 additional amino acid) would be expressed in these patients.",PMC1183252,PMC1183252_3
"The study showed that the viruses in some of the patients appear to encode only for the truncated form(s) of 3a and not the full-length 3a protein, indicating that the functionality of full-length 3a is not essential for virus replication.",PMC1183252,PMC1183252_4
