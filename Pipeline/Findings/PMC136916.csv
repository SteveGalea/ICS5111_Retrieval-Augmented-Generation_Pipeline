"The authors have developed a simple biochemical assay to measure Norovirus (NV) VLP binding to abh histo-blood group antigens, which suggests that individuals with the se+ phenotype are more susceptible to NV infection than se- individuals.",PMC136916,PMC136916_0
"The authors have identified two additional mechanisms for NV attachment, one potentially not related to secretor phenotype or abh histo-blood group antigens.",PMC136916,PMC136916_1
NV-challenged human volunteers produced robust serum IgG responses that efficiently blocked binding of NV VLPs with abh histo-blood group antigens.,PMC136916,PMC136916_2
"Immunization with VEE replicons expressing NV VLPs stimulated robust titers of attachment-blocking antibody in mice, while oral NV VLP inoculation did not.",PMC136916,PMC136916_3
"The methods described in the manuscript could provide a means for detecting and measuring type-specific NV neutralizing antibody to clarify the understanding of an individual's NV exposure history. Three individuals with prechallenge anti-NV IgG that partially blocked abh histo-blood group antigen binding may have been recently exposed to NV or a genetically similar NLV, while the anti-NV IgG in the other seven individuals recognized cross-reactive epitopes and is indicative of prior exposure to other NLVs but not NV.",PMC136916,PMC136916_4
