"This study is the first comprehensive investigation of anti-s igg and igm antibodies to four non-sars-related human coronaviruses (hcovs) in a general population in Beijing, using spike (s) protein as an antigen in indirect immunofluorescence assay (ifa).",PMC3848659,PMC3848659_0
"The study found that both anti-s igg and igm antibodies against these four hcovs were detected at high rates (>70%) among healthy adults, and anti-s igg antibodies against individual hcovs were detected in the sera of asymptomatic children.",PMC3848659,PMC3848659_1
"The study revealed that exposure to hcov is common in childhood, and the first infection by all four non-sars-related hcovs takes place during childhood.",PMC3848659,PMC3848659_2
The study also demonstrated that the prevalence of these four non-sars-related hcovs-directed igg antibodies among children >1 year of age increases with age up to 6 years and declines sharply after 14 years of age.,PMC3848659,PMC3848659_3
These findings suggest that sustained hcov infection becomes more likely with increasing age.,PMC3848659,PMC3848659_4
