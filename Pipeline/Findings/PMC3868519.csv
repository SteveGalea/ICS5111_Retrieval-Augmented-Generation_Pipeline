"Systemic levels of 26 cytokines, chemokines, and soluble receptors in hfmd patients are significantly different from those in control patients, with increased expression levels of il-6, ifn-γ, and tnf-α, as well as decreased levels of il-12p40, il-1ra, il-17a, and mip-1β.",PMC3868519,PMC3868519_0
"Hfmd patients have generally elevated inflammation, with increased expression levels of il-2, il-3, il-15, soluble trail, eotaxin, and il-12p40, and decreased levels of cxcl1, cxcl9, and ccl27.",PMC3868519,PMC3868519_1
"Methylprednisolone treatment does not significantly affect the expression levels of hfmd-characteristic inflammatory biomarkers in hfmd patients, with a tendency for increased il-17a levels in cns-complicated hfmd patients.",PMC3868519,PMC3868519_2
"Hfmd patients with cardio-respiratory dysfunction have significantly higher levels of il-1β, il-1ra, and g-csf in comparison to hfmd patients without cardio-respiratory dysfunction.",PMC3868519,PMC3868519_3
"Hfmd patients without complications still have significantly more neutrophils and fewer lymphocytes than control patients, indicating altered leukocyte numbers in peripheral blood due to differential chemotactic functions of chemokines.",PMC3868519,PMC3868519_4
