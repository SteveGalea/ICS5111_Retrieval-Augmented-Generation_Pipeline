"In a study published in Nature Communications, researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to reveal the structure of a virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), during its entry into mammalian cells. The findings shed light on the distinct structural rearrangements of the virus core and its surface spikes during assembly and maturation. The study also revealed similar membrane recruiting subunits in the major capsid protein (MCP) of HSV and vaccinia virus (VV), but with different outcomes, as HSV MCP forms membrane-containing viruses while VV D13 is a scaffold that leaves the membrane during virus maturation and is not present in viruses.",PMC3163493,PMC3163493_0
"A study published in the Journal of Structural Biology used cryo-EM to capture the release mechanism of stiv, a virus that causes pyramid-like protrusions on the surface of cells. The study found that a single viral protein was sufficient to induce pyramid formation, even in the absence of virus infection. The pyramids have sevenfold symmetry and display sharp facets, and the process of pyramid protruding out of a thinning cell wall and perturbing the s-layer was also captured by cryo-EM.",PMC3163493,PMC3163493_1
"In a study published in the Journal of Virology, researchers used cryo-EM and electron microscopy (EM) to follow the assembly of flock house virus (FHV) in insect cells. The study allowed viral arrays to be visualized with both fluorescence and EM analysis and showed that heavily modified mitochondria were the sites of viral RNA replication.",PMC3163493,PMC3163493_2
"A study published in the Journal of Structural Biology used cryo-EM to reveal the structure of the inner-membrane-containing particles of stiv and vaccinia virus (VV). The study found that the similar inner-membrane-containing particles are visualized, and the similar tertiary structures of the stiv MCP and VV D13 protein share similar folds. The study also showed that virus factories or viroplasm have been reported in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems where proteins and newly synthesized genomes are confined within specific compartments for efficient viral re",PMC3163493,PMC3163493_3
