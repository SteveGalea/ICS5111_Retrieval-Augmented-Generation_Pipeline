"Retrocyclins, a class of cathelicidin-derived peptides found in humans, rhesus macaques, and baboons, demonstrate potent antimicrobial activity against various bacterial and viral pathogens, including HIV-1, influenza A virus, and Staphylococcus aureus.",PMC3411038,PMC3411038_0
"Retrocyclins, unlike other antimicrobial peptides, are produced in low amounts in human bone marrow and spleen, but their production can be scaled up for systemic applications.",PMC3411038,PMC3411038_1
"Retrocyclins inhibit viral entry by binding to glycoproteins on the surface of viruses, such as gp120 and gp41 in HIV-1 and hemagglutinin in influenza A virus, respectively.",PMC3411038,PMC3411038_2
"Retrocyclins also have anti-inflammatory properties, as they inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1Î² and IL-8, in response to bacterial and viral infections.",PMC3411038,PMC3411038_3
"Retrocyclins are multivalent lectins that cross-link viral surface glycoproteins, preventing viral entry and enhancing viral clearance by phagocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages.",PMC3411038,PMC3411038_4
