"PTX3, a multifunctional protein involved in host defense, recognizes and binds to selectin P, a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of activated neutrophils and platelets, to capture pathogens. In septic patients, the plasma levels of pTX3-selectin P complex are increased, but do not significantly correlate with mortality.",PMC3521240,PMC3521240_0
"PTX3, in concert with bactericidal proteazurocidin 1 (AZU1) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), enhances pathogen clearance efficiency by forming a complex with these proteins for the recognition and clearance of pathogens.",PMC3521240,PMC3521240_1
"PTX3, in the bloodstream, forms a complex with net component proteins, including histone H1, histone H2A, and basic proteins such as defa1, AZU1, and MPO, for the recognition and clearance of pathogens.",PMC3521240,PMC3521240_2
"PTX3, in concert with pentraxin 3, brings net component proteins into close proximity with pathogens that it captures, to enhance pathogen clearance.",PMC3521240,PMC3521240_3
"PTX3, in nets, contributes to host defense by facilitating pathogen clearance efficiency of AZU1 and MPO, through their direct interaction with pTX3.",PMC3521240,PMC3521240_4
