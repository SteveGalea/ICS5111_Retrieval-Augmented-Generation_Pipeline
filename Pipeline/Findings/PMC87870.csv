"The npcr assay described in the study was able to detect a variety of serologically different ccv strains, including tn449, nvsl, sa4, and an Australian field strain (uwsmn-1), as well as intermittent viral shedding up to 13 days post-challenge.",PMC87870,PMC87870_0
"The npcr assay was found to be approximately 4 Ã— 104 times more sensitive than electron microscopy, with a detection limit of 25 tcid50 per g of unprocessed feces, compared to the reported detection limit of approximately 106 particles per g of unprocessed feces for electron microscopy.",PMC87870,PMC87870_1
The ability of the npcr assay to detect viral shedding beyond the detection limit of viral isolation demonstrates the increased sensitivity of the assay over viral isolation techniques in the detection of field isolates.,PMC87870,PMC87870_2
"The npcr assay was able to detect ccv shedding from day 4 post-challenge up to day 9 by virus isolation, whereas intermittent viral shedding up to day 13 was detected by the npcr assay.",PMC87870,PMC87870_3
"The phylogenetic analysis of the npcr assay products revealed that the Australian field strain (uwsmn-1) forms a discrete branch which is intermediate between those of the typical ccvs and focvs, suggesting that the s genes of this strain may have arisen by homologous recombination between ccvs and focvs. However, further investigation, including sequencing of other regions from these isolates and viral isolation, is required to confirm this notion.",PMC87870,PMC87870_4
