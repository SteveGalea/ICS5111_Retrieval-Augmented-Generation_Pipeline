"This study identified two novel variants of simian hemorrhagic fever virus (shFV) in a wild red colobus monkey from Uganda. These variants, named shFV-krc1 and shFV-krc2, are highly divergent from each other and from the previously described shFV type strain. Both variants contain homologs of the type strain shFV orfs 2a, 2b, and 3, but their genomic architecture, including additional orfs at the 3' end, is distinct from that of other arteriviruses.",PMC3081318,PMC3081318_0
"Phylogenetic analysis revealed that shFV is more divergent than any other arterivirus, with a degree of within-species divergence approximately equivalent to that between prRSV and LDV, which are considered different viral species. The study also suggested that wild African primates, including red colobus, may harbor a very diverse population of shFV variants.",PMC3081318,PMC3081318_1
"The study highlights the utility of direct pyrosequencing for detecting novel viruses and characterizing viral genomic architecture during natural infection. The method, which combines random hexamer-primed reverse transcription and double-stranded cDNA synthesis, obviated the need for PCR amplification and prevented the potential introduction of amplification-induced error and template bias associated with whole genome amplification.",PMC3081318,PMC3081318_2
"The study provides evidence that wild African primates can harbor shFV subclinically and suggests that these primates may be reservoirs for unknown pathogens of potential concern for global health. The study underscores the need for extreme care when introducing primates into new environments, as asymptomatic carriers of novel viral pathogens might come into contact with clinically susceptible hosts.",PMC3081318,PMC3081318_3
