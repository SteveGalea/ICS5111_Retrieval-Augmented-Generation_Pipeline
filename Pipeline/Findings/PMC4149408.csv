"The study found that the hcov spike protein, which is responsible for binding to the host cell receptor, has a high degree of conservancy among different strains of the virus, making it a promising candidate for vaccine development.",PMC4149408,PMC4149408_0
"The study also identified potential b cell and t cell epitopes for vaccine design, with the t cell epitope having a higher degree of conservancy among different strains of the virus.",PMC4149408,PMC4149408_1
"The study found that the hcov spike protein has a high degree of population coverage in different regions of the world, particularly in Europe and East Asia, where the virus has caused outbreaks in the past.",PMC4149408,PMC4149408_2
"The study noted that the proposed epitope did not possess the criteria for allergen cross-reactivity prediction, making it a nonallergenic candidate for vaccine development.",PMC4149408,PMC4149408_3
"The study suggested that the proposed epitope would be able to trigger an efficacious immune response as a peptide vaccine in vivo, with previously described, validated procedures used for prediction.",PMC4149408,PMC4149408_4
