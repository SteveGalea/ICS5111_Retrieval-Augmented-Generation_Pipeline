This study identified 933 differentially expressed genes at four time points in vaccine iltv-infected chicken embryonic lung cells.,PMC3353197,PMC3353197_0
The study revealed that vaccine iltv infection resulted in weak cytopathic effects and cellular morphology recovery after initial cytopathic effects.,PMC3353197,PMC3353197_1
"The analysis using the ingenuity pathways analysis program identified 10 networks and 35 molecules in each network, with a focus on the closest interacting focus molecules within the differentially expressed genes.",PMC3353197,PMC3353197_2
The study found that 213 differentially expressed genes showed a similar expression pattern in both virulent strain and vaccine iltv infection.,PMC3353197,PMC3353197_3
"The study showed that 21 genes, including ul35 and us5, were significantly modulated by vaccine iltv infection and were validated by end-point reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.",PMC3353197,PMC3353197_4
