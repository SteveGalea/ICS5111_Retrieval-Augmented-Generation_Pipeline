"The intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in the development and maturation of the gut and immune system in neonates. Alterations in the intestinal microbiota, such as decreased diversity and overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, predispose the intestine to inflammation and increase the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).",PMC3589666,PMC3589666_0
"The use of antibiotics in neonates can lead to long-lasting consequences, including alterations in the intestinal microbiota and increased risk of NEC. Intestinal inflammation and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-1, are increased in patients with NEC.",PMC3589666,PMC3589666_1
"Commensal healthy bacteria, such as lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus thermophilus, play a role in cytoprotection of the enterocyte and intestinal mucosa and help maintain a normal intestinal flora in neonates, thereby decreasing the incidence of NEC.",PMC3589666,PMC3589666_2
"Risk factors for bacterial translocation, such as abnormal intestinal colonization and alterations in the intestinal permeability, are associated with increased risk of NEC and other complications, such as bloodstream infections.",PMC3589666,PMC3589666_3
The use of histamine 2 (H2) blockers and maintenance of an acidic gastric ph less than 3.0 in neonates less than 1500 g are associated with increased risk of NEC and bacterial translocation. Maintaining a gastric ph greater than 4.0 decreases the incidence of NEC and is strongly correlated with higher gastric enteric bacterial colony counts.,PMC3589666,PMC3589666_4
