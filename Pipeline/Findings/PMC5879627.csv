"The study found that the vast majority of multi-host parasites in mammals have negative standard effect sizes for host phylogenetic relatedness, suggesting phylogenetic constraints on host breadth. However, individual parasites rarely have a phylogenetic host breadth that differs significantly from expected by chance. For example, viruses often infect closely related hosts, as has been observed previously, but viral relatedness in the bat rabies system is an important factor partly controlling the sharing of parasite species among host species.",PMC5879627,PMC5879627_0
"The study revealed that parasites with a paratenic host may obtain a rare ultimate host that is not technically a definitive host because no reproduction occurs. For example, a helminth species with a paratenic host may establish itself in some reservoir host species and occasionally spill over to others, as occurred, for example, in the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus transmission from camels to humans.",PMC5879627,PMC5879627_1
"The study suggested that parasites with a low specificity of bacteria are more generalist than protozoa. However, future studies on restricted subsets of related parasites will allow consideration of phylogenetic structure of the parasite species. For example, viral relatedness in the bat rabies system is an important factor partly controlling the sharing of parasite species among host species.",PMC5879627,PMC5879627_2
"The study found that the level of host relatedness of a parasite's host set is controlled by several factors that are not measured explicitly and that sharing may arise via several different mechanisms. For example, parasites may jump between host species, maintain themselves in some reservoir host species and occasionally spill over to others, or some parasites that are apparently shared between hosts may be different species.",PMC5879627,PMC5879627_3
"The study highlighted the limitations of the data, including the variation in richness, variation in sampling effort, and geographic ranges of host species, which may impact the power of statistical inference associated with the null modelling approach. For example, if a parasite has only two host species, then picking many pairs of host species at random and comparing their relatedness to the relatedness of the observed pair may be more likely to result in the observation occurring towards the center of the distribution of random relatedness. This is less likely to occur when the host richness of a parasite is high. Even though the study controlled for sampling effort using appropriate null models, this may not account",PMC5879627,PMC5879627_4
