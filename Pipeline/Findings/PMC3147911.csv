"In a study examining the molecular epidemiology of canine parvovirus (CPV) in the United Kingdom, researchers found that despite the global spread of CPV-2, only CPV-2a and CPV-2b viruses were circulating in the United Kingdom, and the majority of viruses did not cluster based on these key amino acid mutations. The study also identified 50 different dna sequence types in the 150 viruses analyzed, with 32 unique amino acid sequences identified, indicating limited opportunities for global transmission of CPV.",PMC3147911,PMC3147911_0
"The study revealed that within the United Kingdom, there was evidence of significant geographic clustering in some areas, such as the most prevalent virus in the liverpool region, which was present over a period of two years and rarely found elsewhere. This suggests that some CPV sequence types may have restricted opportunities for spread, even within countries.",PMC3147911,PMC3147911_1
"The variability in the full CPV vp2 gene sequence enabled the researchers to investigate the molecular epidemiology of these viruses at the national level. They found that although the majority of viruses clustered based on key amino acid mutations, neither CPV-2a nor CPV-2b type was monophyletic, suggesting that in the United Kingdom at least, the 2a/2b phenotype may have evolved on several occasions.",PMC3147911,PMC3147911_2
"The study also identified two unique amino acid mutations within the United Kingdom samples, at residues 139 and 274, which form part of the beta barrel inside the virus and are found on the 3-fold spike, a region of high antigenicity, respectively. The significance of these mutations, however, remains unknown.",PMC3147911,PMC3147911_3
"The study found that all of the potential vaccine breakdowns, which were included in the study, were distinct and showed no consistent mutations, suggesting that there is no group of viruses circulating within the United Kingdom that is specifically capable of evading vaccine-induced immunity. This is in agreement with a range of studies that have shown that currently available vaccines protect against the full range of antigenic types identified to date.",PMC3147911,PMC3147911_4
