"The ligand-receptor pair izumo1 and izumo1r are essential for gamete recognition and adhesion during fertilization, but izumo1 may play a secondary role in the organization and stabilization of higher-order heteromeric complexes required for membrane fusion.",PMC6824042,PMC6824042_0
"Fertilization-competent mouse spermatozoa harbor several high molecular weight protein complexes, with at least two containing izumo1 in partnership with gli pathogenesis-related 1 like 1 (glipr1l1).",PMC6824042,PMC6824042_1
The interaction between izumo1 and glipr1l1 is associated with lipid rafts and dynamically remodeled upon acrosome exocytosis.,PMC6824042,PMC6824042_2
Selective ablation of glipr1l1 leads to compromised sperm function characterized by a reduced ability to undergo acrosome reaction and failure of izumo1 redistribution.,PMC6824042,PMC6824042_3
"Collectively, these findings characterize multimeric protein complexes on the sperm surface and identify glipr1l1 as a physiologically relevant regulator of izumo1 function and the fertilization process.",PMC6824042,PMC6824042_4
