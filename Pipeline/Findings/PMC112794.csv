"This study demonstrated that the hcv ns5b rna polymerase preferentially binds to a 3′ region of the viral genomic rna containing sequences coding for the carboxyl terminus of the hcv polyprotein, specifically the amino acid residues 83 to 194 and 196 to 298.",PMC112794,PMC112794_0
"The study identified two independent rna-binding domains (rbds) of ns5b in these regions, rbd1 from amino acid residues 83 to 194 and rbd2 from residues 196 to 298.",PMC112794,PMC112794_1
"The study revealed that the binding activity of ns5b to the viral rna was annihilated when the rna transcript was divided into two fragments, disrupted the formation of a conserved stem-loop structure, sl2, made up from sequences of the 3′ coding region and 3′ncr across the stop codon of hcv polyprotein.",PMC112794,PMC112794_2
"The study identified several conserved amino acid residues involved in rna binding and catalysis, including site a (220-dxxxxd-225) and sites c (317-gdd-319) and d (r-345) of the polymerase module, and clusters 151-kggrkpar-158, 209-kskk-212, and 277-rrcr-280.",PMC112794,PMC112794_3
"The study found that there was no direct interaction between hcv ns5a protein and the viral rna, but preliminary data did suggest there was cross talk between ns5a and ns5b.",PMC112794,PMC112794_4
