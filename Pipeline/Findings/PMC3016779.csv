"hMPV and coronavirus have different in vitro tropisms, as the isolation of one virus did not affect the recovery of the other from different cell lines.",PMC3016779,PMC3016779_1
Six patients were co-infected with hMPV and coronavirus.,PMC3016779,PMC3016779_2
"The study confirmed that llc-mk2 cells, a widely available cell line, can support the growth of hMPV.",PMC3016779,PMC3016779_3
"The study suggested that hMPV and coronavirus have different transmission efficiency, as their prevalence may not be the same.",PMC3016779,PMC3016779_4
