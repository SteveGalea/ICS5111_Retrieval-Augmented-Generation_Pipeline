"A study by Schneider et al. (2003) identified a noncanonical q/n peptide bond cleavage site in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) 3c-like protease (3clpro) sequence, represented by the peptide sp5. This site, which is processed approximately 10-fold more actively than other cleavage sites, is located between the cleavage sites flanking the 3clpro domain and the putative membrane protein 2 (pp2).",PMC103821,PMC103821_0
"The study by Schneider et al. (2003) also confirmed the HCV-229e pp1a/pp1ab processing scheme established by in vitro experiments in virus-infected cells. This scheme involves the cleavage of amino acids 3490 to 4068 by HCV-229e 3clpro, resulting in the production of four polypeptides, including pp5, pp23, pp12, and pp16.",PMC103821,PMC103821_1
"The study by Schneider et al. (2003) also demonstrated the intracellular localization of HCV-229e pp1a/pp1ab-derived polypeptides, which accumulate in infected cells and produce a typical punctate staining pattern as early as 4 hours post-infection (h.p.i.). This staining pattern is consistent with the localization of replicase gene-encoded polypeptides of other nidoviruses.",PMC103821,PMC103821_2
The study by Schneider et al. (2003) also revealed that competition experiments using synthetic peptide substrates allowed the determination of relative rates of cleavage for different HCV-229e 3clpro substrates. These experiments showed that substrates containing the cleavage sites flanking the 3clpro domain and the putative membrane protein 2 (pp2) are converted significantly faster than the noncanonical q/n peptide bond cleavage site represented by the peptide sp5.,PMC103821,PMC103821_3
The study by Schneider et al. (2003) also provided a basis for further investigations into the role of HCV-229e 3clpro in virus replication,PMC103821,PMC103821_4
