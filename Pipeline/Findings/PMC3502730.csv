"The study presented in this article aimed to develop a method for mapping the positions and frequencies of junctions between recombined fragments of DNA in the genome of a virus using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The method involved preparing a library of sequences corresponding to all possible recombination events in the virus genome, aligning reads to the host genome reference, and detecting junctions using bowtie alignment parameters. The study also involved purifying viral particles and disrupted viral capsid proteins, as well as preparing and sequencing RNA using a modified version of the Illumina protocol. The findings from this study have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of recombination in viruses and could potentially lead to the development of new therapies for treating viral infections.",PMC3502730,PMC3502730_0
"The study found that the frequency of recombination in the genome of fihv, the baculovirus virus used in this study, is high, with an average of 1 recombination event per 2.2 kilobases. This suggests that recombination is an important mechanism for viral genome evolution and could potentially be targeted for therapeutic intervention in viral infections.",PMC3502730,PMC3502730_1
"The study also found that the majority of recombination events in the fihv genome are intragenomic and involve the formation of circular intermediates, which are then resolved by a second recombination event. This finding has important implications for understanding the mechanisms of recombination in viruses and could potentially lead to the development of new strategies for targeting viral recombination events for therapeutic intervention.",PMC3502730,PMC3502730_2
"The study also identified a number of defective replicative intermediates (RIs) in the fihv genome, which are thought to arise from the formation of circular intermediates during recombination. These defective RIs were found to be enriched in regions of the genome with high GC content, which is consistent with previous findings in other viruses.",PMC3502730,PMC3502730_3
"The study also identified a number of di-RNAs in the fihv genome, which are thought to arise from the expression of defective RIs. These di-RNAs were found to be enriched in regions of the genome with high GC content, which is also consistent with previous findings in other viruses.",PMC3502730,PMC3502730_4
