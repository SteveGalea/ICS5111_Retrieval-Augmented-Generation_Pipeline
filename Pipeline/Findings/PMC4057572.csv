"Ev71 infection increases the viability, activation, cytokine release, and t-cell priming activity of dcs, which are highly specialized and efficient in uptaking and processing antigens including various viruses (Section II, Findings 1-5).",PMC4057572,PMC4057572_0
"Ev71 infection enhances jnk1/2 phosphorylation with prolonged infection, and the phosphorylation of jnk1/2 reaches its peak at 1 h p.i. (Section III, Findings 1-2).",PMC4057572,PMC4057572_1
"Ev71 infection increases mrna levels of mek3, mek6, and p38 mapk, as well as phosphorylation of p38 mapk, and the phosphorylation of p38 mapk is inhibited by pretreatment with sp600125 or sb203580 in ev71-infected idcs (Section III, Findings 3-5).",PMC4057572,PMC4057572_2
"Ev71 infection increases the productions of il-2, il-6, il-10, il-12 p40, tnf-α, and ifn-β, and the enhanced secretions of il-6, il-10, and tnf-α are remarkably inhibited by pretreatment with sp600125 and sb203580 in ev71-infected idcs (Section IV, Findings 1-5).",PMC4057572,PMC4057572_3
"Jnk1/2 and p38 mapk regulate viral replication by acting at certain specific steps of viral replication cycle, including attachment, entry, gene transcription, protein expressions, and assembly, as well as viral pathogenesis (Discussion and Conclusion).",PMC4057572,PMC4057572_4
