"The Nipah protein of class III viruses induces autophagy in infected cells through its viroporin activity, which involves the formation of autophagosomes and the maturation of the autophagy pathway. This process is essential for the maintenance of cell survival and innate immune evasion during Nipah virus infection.",PMC4488716,PMC4488716_0
"The viroporin protein of influenza A virus, M2, contributes to the stability of the virus at room temperature and facilitates the delivery of lipid resources to the plasma membrane, which is a multifunctional protein that exhibits its functions independently of its ion channel activity.",PMC4488716,PMC4488716_1
"The small membrane-associated viral protein, NSP6, of coronavirus is a multifunctional protein localized in the ER, which serves as a membrane anchor during the assembly of coronavirus replication complex. It also induces autophagosome formation in infected cells through its viroporin activity.",PMC4488716,PMC4488716_2
"The viroporin protein, BMP2, of influenza A virus facilitates virion budding for the filamentous strain of influenza A virus, and contributes to the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and ATF6 branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which are required for the maintenance of cell survival and innate immune evasion during influenza A virus infection.",PMC4488716,PMC4488716_3
"The viroporin protein, NSP4B, of flavivirus induces autophagosome formation in infected cells through its viroporin activity, which is essential for the maintenance of cell survival and innate immune evasion during flavivirus infection. This process is driven by two hydrophobic transmembrane non-structural proteins, NSP3, and NSP4A, which serve as membrane anchors during the assembly of flavivirus replication complex.",PMC4488716,PMC4488716_4
