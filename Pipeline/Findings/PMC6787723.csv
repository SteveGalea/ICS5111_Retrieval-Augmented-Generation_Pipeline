"Using the lips technology, antibodies against wild type p53 and mutant p53 variants were analyzed. Three cancer-associated mutant variants of p53, p53-r175h, and p53-r273h, were tested, but the antibody profiles against these variants were similar to wild type p53.",PMC6787723,PMC6787723_0
"Using lips, antibodies against the hpv-16 oncoproteins e2, e7, and e6 were analyzed. Nine (45%) of the hnscc subjects were seropositive for e6, eight (35%) were seropositive for e2, and seven (35%) were seropositive for e7 protein.",PMC6787723,PMC6787723_1
"Using lips, antibodies against hpv-16 e6 were analyzed in a high-throughput fashion using a one-minute lipsticks assay. The assay performed quite well to detect hpv-16 e6 antibodies associated with hnscc, with 89% (8/9) sensitivity and 100% specificity.",PMC6787723,PMC6787723_2
"Using lips, antibodies against wild type p53 and mutant p53 variants were analyzed in a small cohort. Twenty hv controls, twenty cc patients, and twenty hnscc patients were tested. Approximately 25% (5/20) of the cc patients and 20% (4/20) of the hnscc patients had statistically significant autoantibodies against wild type p53.",PMC6787723,PMC6787723_3
