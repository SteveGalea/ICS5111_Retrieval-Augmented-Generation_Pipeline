"A novel class of aav vectors, based on the aav2 serotype, outperforms existing aav vectors in terms of generating antigen-specific T cell and antibody responses to HIV-1 antigens. This is due to the improved immunogenicity and gene transfer efficiency of these vectors, as demonstrated in both balb/c mice and hybrid mice.",PMC2168776,PMC2168776_0
"The aav2-based vectors also demonstrate a more potent and effective T cell response, compared to traditional vectors, as evidenced by the higher frequency of IFN-Î³-producing CD8+ T cells and the presence of triple-cytokine-expressing cells with a memory phenotype.",PMC2168776,PMC2168776_1
"However, the initial activation of CD8+ T cells by antigen-presenting cells is dysfunctional following aav2 administration, as evidenced by the presence of substantial numbers of nonresponsive gag-specific T cells at peak and the absence of any memory phenotypes.",PMC2168776,PMC2168776_2
"The negative impact of aav on the ability of Adc7 to boost CD8+ T cells is not observed with the b-cell response, which is boosted as much as 10-fold following Adc7 administration.",PMC2168776,PMC2168776_3
"The study also suggests potential limitations of aav-based vaccines, such as the lack of effective CD8+ T cell response boosting following aav administration, and the need for further investigation into the mechanisms responsible for the dysfunctional CD8+ T cell response and confirmation of these findings in primates.",PMC2168776,PMC2168776_4
