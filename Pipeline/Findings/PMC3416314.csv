"The article describes the ability of the immediate-early protein IE180 encoded by the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRS) to suppress phosphorylation of eIF2α, a cellular factor required for global protein synthesis.",PMC3416314,PMC3416314_0
The study also reports that the cellular phosphatase PP1 is involved in PRRS-mediated dephosphorylation of eIF2α.,PMC3416314,PMC3416314_1
The findings suggest that PRRS IE180 affects gene expression of cellular factors that influence the phosphorylation status of eIF2α.,PMC3416314,PMC3416314_2
"The study shows that the decrease in eIF2α phosphorylation is already evident at 1 hour post-infection, which may have important consequences for the virus during early stages of virus replication, in the face of an active innate immune response.",PMC3416314,PMC3416314_3
"The article highlights that the overall amino acid homology between IE180 orthologues is relatively low, ranging from 32% to 40%, but clustalw analysis showed that amino acid homology is condensed in 4 highly conserved regions over the different alphaherpesviruses. This suggests that other IE180 orthologues may affect gene expression of cellular factors that influence the phosphorylation status of eIF2α.",PMC3416314,PMC3416314_4
