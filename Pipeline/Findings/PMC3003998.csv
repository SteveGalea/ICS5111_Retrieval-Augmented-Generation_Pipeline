"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection leads to a defective immune response to hepatitis B virus (HBV) proteins due to the downregulation of key transcription factors, including NF-ÎºB and STAT1, in HBV-infected hepatocytes.",PMC3003998,PMC3003998_0
"In chronic HBV infection, the regulatory T (Treg) cell population in the liver is increased, contributing to the tolerance to the virus antigens and the suppression of the antiviral immune responses.",PMC3003998,PMC3003998_1
"A combination of antiviral treatment and immunomodulation, including the restoration of T cell responses and the enhancement of innate immune responses, is essential to achieve a sustained control of chronic HBV infection.",PMC3003998,PMC3003998_2
"Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer is a safe and well-tolerated strategy for treatment of chronic HBV infection, as demonstrated by its successful application in woodchuck models.",PMC3003998,PMC3003998_3
"In the treatment of chronic HBV infection, the restoration of antiviral immune responses in nonhuman primates, including woodchucks, provides a valuable model for the translation of recent progresses for clinical use of therapeutic vaccines.",PMC3003998,PMC3003998_4
"In chronic HBV infection, the expression of HBV proteins suppresses host innate responses, and this issue requires further investigation to design more rational approaches for treatment.",PMC3003998,PMC3003998_5
"In the treatment of chronic HBV infection, the question of the optimal combination of different types of vaccines remains to be investigated to maximize their effects and avoid negative interference between the vaccines.",PMC3003998,PMC3003998_6
"In the treatment of chronic HBV infection, the future design of therapeutic vaccines needs to consider the mutual influences of different types of vaccines in nonhuman primates, as patients have undergone other infections, to understand how pre-existing infections and immunological backgrounds will influence the effect of therapeutic vaccines.",PMC3003998,PMC3003998_7
"The study on gene therapy with semliki forest viral vector expressing high levels of murine interleukin-12 (IL-12) on remission of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronically HBV-infected woodchucks presents a dose-dependent reduction in tumor size, and the therapy results in a transient induction of lym",PMC3003998,PMC3003998_8
