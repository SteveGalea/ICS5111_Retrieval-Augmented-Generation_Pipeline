"Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, was widely used for treating SARS patients, but it was later found to have no significant in vitro activity against SARS-CoV and caused significant haemolysis in many patients (500 words).",PMC3747521,PMC3747521_0
"Protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir in combination is a boosted protease inhibitor regimen widely used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In vitro activity against SARS-CoV was demonstrated for lopinavir and ribavirin at 4 and 50 µg/ml, respectively, whereas inhibition of in vitro cytopathic effects was achieved down to a concentration of 1 µg/ml of lopinavir combined with 6.25 µg/ml of ribavirin (500 words).",PMC3747521,PMC3747521_1
A retrospective review has shown that the addition of lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg (lpv/r) as initial therapy was associated with lower overall death rate (2.3% vs. 15.6%) and intubation rate (0% vs. 11%) than a matched historical cohort that received ribavirin alone as the initial anti-viral therapy (500 words).,PMC3747521,PMC3747521_2
Induction of ip-10 is thought to be a critical event in the initiation of immune-mediated lung injury and lymphocyte apoptosis. The use of rescue pulsed methylprednisolone (mp) during clinical progression was associated with favorable clinical improvement in some patients with resolution of fever and lung opacities within 2 weeks (500 words).,PMC3747521,PMC3747521_3
"With the rescue pulsed mp approach, avascular necrosis of bone was found in 12 (4.7%) patients after screening 254 patients using magnetic resonance imaging at PWH. The risk of avascular necrosis was 0.6% for patients receiving less than 3 g, and was 13% for those receiving more than 3 g prednisolone-equivalent dose (500 words).",PMC3747521,PMC3747521_4
