"PrRSV inhibits Jak/Stat signaling and suppresses the expression of antiviral ISGs through multiple mechanisms, including blocking the nuclear translocation of Stat1 and inducing the degradation of Karyopherin-alpha1, which is essential for mediating the nuclear import of ISG15 (findings 1-3).",PMC4101967,PMC4101967_0
"PrRSV nsp2, a cysteine protease domain at the n-terminus, is an antagonist for the antiviral activity of ISG15 by reducing ISG15 production and conjugation, and this function requires the n-terminal pl2 domain of nsp2 (findings 4-5).",PMC4101967,PMC4101967_1
"PrRSV infection in pigs leads to delayed production and low titer of neutralizing antibodies and weak cell-mediated immune response, possibly due to prRSV interference with IFN-mediated innate immunity at multiple steps from IFN induction and IFN-activated signaling to activity of ISGs (findings 6-8).",PMC4101967,PMC4101967_2
"PrRSV effect on innate immunity is at multiple levels, from IFN induction and IFN-activated signaling to activity of ISGs, and the variation of these activities in innate immunity is not a surprise, given the divergence of prRSV strains in sequences, as the multifold interplay between the virus and host may determine the consequences (finding 9).",PMC4101967,PMC4101967_3
"The IFN-mediated antiviral response drives the expression of more than 300 genes, and among the antiviral ISGs, the best-studied ones are 2'-5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetases (OASS), Ribonuclease L RNAsel, DSRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), p56, Mx1, and ISG15. PrRSV nsp2 inhibits the antiviral function of ISG15 by reducing ISG15 production and conjugation, and prRSV is able to inhibit the polyIC-induced activation of PKR and its downstream effector eIF2Î± (findings 10-14).",PMC4101967,PMC4101967_4
