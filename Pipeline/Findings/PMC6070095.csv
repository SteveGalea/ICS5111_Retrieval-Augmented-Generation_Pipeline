"In a study of 32 adults with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma after receiving CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, the researchers found that 22 of 32 patients (66%) experienced at least one infection, with bacterial infections occurring a median of 18 days after therapy and fungal infections at a median of 23 days.",PMC6070095,PMC6070095_0
"The study also found that the presence of grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was the only factor independently associated with any infection, and in particular bloodstream infections (BSIs), with a median time to BSI of 19 days after therapy.",PMC6070095,PMC6070095_1
"Although the study did not find cases of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, nearly all documented bacterial infections diagnosed within the first 30 days after therapy were due to resistant organisms, including 3 VRE, 2 ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, 1 multidrug-resistant P. Aeruginosa, and 1 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection.",PMC6070095,PMC6070095_2
"The study also found that the majority of patients (32 of 42; 76%) receiving antifungal prophylaxis received micafungin prophylaxis, and the rate, degree, and duration of b-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia may vary, depending on the patients’ age (children vs adults).",PMC6070095,PMC6070095_3
"However, the study noted that because prolonged B-cell aplasia is a known complication after targeted CAR T-cell therapy, the rate, degree, and duration of b-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia may require further prospective evaluations, as the number of examined patients (n = 24) was small, and the rate, degree, and duration of b-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia may vary, depending on the patients’ age (children vs adults).",PMC6070095,PMC6070095_4
