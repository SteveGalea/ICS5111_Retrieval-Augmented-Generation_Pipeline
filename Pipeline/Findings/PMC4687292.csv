"Ten cats developed active feline leukemia virus (felv) infections after receiving blood from aviremic provirus carriers, with some developing fatal felv-associated disease.",PMC4687292,PMC4687292_0
"Five cats received provirus-positive aviremic blood, while the other five received blood containing provirus- and viral RNA-positive but aviremic blood. Cats that received blood with only proviral DNA exhibited a later onset but graver outcome of felv infection than cats that received blood with both proviral DNA and viral RNA.",PMC4687292,PMC4687292_1
Leukocyte counts and cytokine analyses indicated that the immune system of cats that received blood with proviral DNA and viral RNA reacted quicker and more efficiently.,PMC4687292,PMC4687292_2
"Four cats developed a t-cell lymphoma, including one with secondary lymphoblastic leukemia.",PMC4687292,PMC4687292_3
"The study highlights the biological and epidemiological relevance of felv provirus carriers and the risk of inadvertent felv transmission via blood transfusion, requiring testing of blood donors and products for felv provirus by sensitive polymerase chain reaction.",PMC4687292,PMC4687292_4
