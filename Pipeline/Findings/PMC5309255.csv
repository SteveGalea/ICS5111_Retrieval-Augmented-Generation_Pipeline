"A recent study found that a significant portion of the global food- and waterborne disease burden is caused by viruses with mild symptoms, which often go undetected due to a focus on viruses with direct clinical impact. This disease burden is expanded by the consequential infections and outbreaks of these viruses in susceptible populations. (500 words)",PMC5309255,PMC5309255_0
"The global food trading, diversification of food sources, and interactions with animals and other reservoirs of food- and waterborne disease related viruses complicate the capability of investigators to detect the original source and to determine the transmission pattern of viruses causing foodborne outbreaks. (500 words)",PMC5309255,PMC5309255_1
"Metagenomic sequencing technologies, bioinformatics analysis tools, and data sharing initiatives can provide a more realistic insight into the global burden of food- and waterborne viral disease and can help to reduce this burden by facilitating the interpretation of metagenomic data and visualization of relationships between genome datasets and metadata. (500 words)",PMC5309255,PMC5309255_2
"The presence and dynamics of viruses in the environment and the food chain are still largely unknown, which poses a challenge for the interpretation of food- and waterborne viral surveillance samples. (500 words)",PMC5309255,PMC5309255_3
"Integration of different data sources and experimental results is crucial for the interpretation of metagenomic sequencing experiments, and interactive web-based data browsing and visualization tools have increased in popularity to facilitate the interaction with and the browsing through highly complicated data in a user-friendly manner.

High genome coverage combined with close sequence identity to a viral reference genome with a known pathogenic phenotype are currently the strongest links between metagenomic sequencing data and disease etiology. (500 words),PMC5309255,PMC5309255_5
"The volume of sequencing databases is increasing rapidly, but sequence annotations and metadata are of varying levels of quality and the speed of analysis decreases with increasing reference datasets. (500 words)",PMC5309255,PMC5309255_6
"The relationship between the infectivity of a detected virus and the detection of a fragment of its genome is not unambiguous, due to factors such as the stability of the virus in the sample matrix and during sample preprocessing steps. (500 words)",PMC5309255,PMC5309255_7
