The discovery of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has led to renewed appreciation of the consequences of emerging infectious diseases.,PMC2238845,PMC2238845_0
"Biomarkers, molecules that can be sensitively measured in the human body, are by definition potentially diagnostic and are increasingly important in both therapeutic and diagnostic processes.",PMC2238845,PMC2238845_1
"Vast resources have been devoted to identifying and developing biomarkers, but the rate of development of novel biomarkers has been falling, suggesting that a resource that leverages existing data is overdue.",PMC2238845,PMC2238845_2
"The infectious disease biomarker database (IDB) catalogs putative and validated biomarkers, relates them to research tools for sequence and structural analyses of the data, and provides resources for sequence and structure analysis.",PMC2238845,PMC2238845_3
"IDB currently includes information on 611 biomarkers from 66 infectious diseases and 70 pathogens, and its goal is to collect a complete dataset of validated or potential biomarkers used in the detection of infectious diseases and to generate a knowledgebase that would be a valuable tool for users interested in the discovery of infectious disease biomarkers.",PMC2238845,PMC2238845_4
