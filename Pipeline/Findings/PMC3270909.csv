"A multivariate analysis of data from a recent study in Hong Kong found that increased concern about a potential pandemic influenza is a significant determinant of willingness to comply with protective health behaviors, such as vaccination, isolation, and mask wearing. This effect is mediated by a range of factors, including age, education level, and psychological distress.",PMC3270909,PMC3270909_0
The study also found that younger individuals (ages 16-24 and 25-34) and those with lower levels of formal education are generally less willing to comply with these behaviors.,PMC3270909,PMC3270909_1
"The analysis suggested that the adoption of an alternative, more active approach to risk communication messages may be necessary before a pandemic occurs, in order to prevent societal estrangement and frighten health care workers and responders.",PMC3270909,PMC3270909_2
"The study highlighted the need for tailored communication and support strategies for certain sectors of the population, such as those in widowed households and those with lower levels of willingness to comply.",PMC3270909,PMC3270909_3
"The study also emphasized the importance of considering the limitations of the current study, which is based on hypothetical, anticipated pandemic scenarios and uses dichotomized responses, and has not included less willing individuals. Future pandemic planning and modeling should take into account the range of factors that influence overall compliance levels.",PMC3270909,PMC3270909_4
