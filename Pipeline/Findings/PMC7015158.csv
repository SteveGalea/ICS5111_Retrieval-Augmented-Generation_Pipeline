"Structural biology methods, such as single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), X-ray crystallography, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), have been used to determine the structures of viral proteins and complexes, revealing insights into their functions and evolutionary relationships.",PMC7015158,PMC7015158_0
"The structure-based protein classification (sbpa) method, which uses the structural similarity between proteins as a basis for classification, has been used to group viral proteins according to their evolutionary relationships and functions.",PMC7015158,PMC7015158_1
Sbpa has revealed that the structural fold of right-handed RNA and DNA polymerases has evolved from six-bladed Î²-propeller proteins of non-viral origin.,PMC7015158,PMC7015158_2
"Sbpa has shown that emerging paramyxoviruses form a structural class that is distinct from archetypal na glycoproteins, suggesting that they may have the potential to mislead the antibody-mediated immune response through the formation of structural classes that are distinct from those presented on the mature virion.",PMC7015158,PMC7015158_3
"Sbpa has demonstrated that the s1-ctd glycoproteins from coronaviruses, which utilize the same receptor, classify according to genetic relationship with other coronavirus s1-ctds, rather than receptor tropism characteristics.",PMC7015158,PMC7015158_4
