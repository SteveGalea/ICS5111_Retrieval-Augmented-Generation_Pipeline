"Intranasal administration of a blocking antibody specific for cxcr2 to mice persistently infected with the neurotropic virus mumps (MHV) reduced polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) migration to the central nervous system (CNS) by >95%, resulting in increased mortality and uncontrolled viral replication.",PMC3522860,PMC3522860_0
"In mice persistently infected with MHV, t cells and macrophages contribute to oligodendrocyte damage and demyelination that is associated with physical disability, but following MHV-induced immune-mediated apoptosis of oligodendrocytes, there is an increase of PMN proliferation and oligodendrocyte maturation followed by partial remyelination.",PMC3522860,PMC3522860_1
"In the chronic phase of MHV infection, cxcl1 is upregulated specifically on astrocytes, which promote remyelination through cxcr2, and ifn-β is upregulated specifically on microglia and infiltrating macrophages and is necessary for viral control.",PMC3522860,PMC3522860_2
"In mice persistently infected with MHV, astrocyte-secreted cxcl1 led to an increased number of proliferating PMNs and increased remyelination, while in microglia, following MHV infection, ifn-β is upregulated specifically on microglia and infiltrating macrophages and is necessary for viral control.",PMC3522860,PMC3522860_3
"In microglia, the switch from a pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory response includes suppression of cxcl1 and upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine ifn-β through the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, following MHV infection.",PMC3522860,PMC3522860_4
