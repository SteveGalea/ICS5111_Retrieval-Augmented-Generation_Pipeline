"In a previous study, the role of cxcl9 in promoting cancer was demonstrated in human digestive organs, but its effect in prostate cancer has not been reported.",PMC6072144,PMC6072144_0
"In the present study, cxcl9-overexpressed mice and c57+dmab mice were selected for investigation, and it was demonstrated that cxcl9 may serve an indirect role in affecting white blood cells.",PMC6072144,PMC6072144_1
"The present study concluded that cxcl9 overexpression reduced the number of t cells in immune organs and the tumor microenvironment, and reduced the secretion of IL-6 and TGF-Î²2, and thereby promoted the development of prostate cancer.",PMC6072144,PMC6072144_2
"The survival rate of cxcl9-overexpressed mice was significantly reduced compared with c57+dmab mice, suggesting that the targeted inhibition of cxcl9 expression may be applied in a clinical setting.",PMC6072144,PMC6072144_3
"In clinical samples, the present study revealed that the mRNA expression levels of cxcl9 in prostate cancer patients at different pathological stages were positively associated with clinical staging, suggesting that patients with high expression of cxcl9 exhibited more advanced pathological features.",PMC6072144,PMC6072144_4
