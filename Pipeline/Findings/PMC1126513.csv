"The World Health Organization (WHO) report on the global tobacco epidemic presents solid evidence on the health effects of tobacco use, which has increased significantly in many low and middle income countries, particularly among young people and women. By 2020, without additional interventions to reduce tobacco use, the health burden from tobacco is expected to double, particularly in developing regions.",PMC1126513,PMC1126513_0
"The report provides concrete evidence on the cost effectiveness and practicability of interventions to reduce tobacco use, particularly in developing countries. Four interventions requiring government action (taxation, clean indoor air laws, a comprehensive ban on advertising, and information dissemination on the health risks of tobacco) are very cost effective in all subregions.",PMC1126513,PMC1126513_1
"The report shows that the most cost effective intervention everywhere is tobacco taxation, and increasing taxation to the highest regional rate currently observed would avert an additional 19 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) each year globally, equivalent to 56% of the estimated total burden attributable to tobacco in 2000.",PMC1126513,PMC1126513_2
"The report highlights the importance of governments in encouraging risk reduction strategies, and increasing taxation is the most cost effective intervention in all regions, as it has the greatest effect on population health and is also the least costly option.",PMC1126513,PMC1126513_3
"The report suggests that the spread of the tobacco epidemic is accelerated and confounded by various factors, including liberalisation of trade, global marketing and communications, and direct foreign investment, and new rules and regulations for interaction between countries are required for health issues. The WHO framework convention on tobacco control is a landmark step towards global cooperative actions against health threats, as it is the first international treaty negotiated under the auspices of the WHO, based on scientific evidence on the tobacco epidemic and its control strategies. The convention shows how global public health problems can be tackled by international collective action, and it includes commitments to monitor and eliminate global smuggling, illicit manufacturing, and counterfeiting of tobacco products, comprehensive bans on advertising and information dissemination activities, and taxation on tobacco products.",PMC1126513,PMC1126513_4
