"The paper presents a novel approach, 2l-pca, for predicting bioactivities of drug candidates based on their physicochemical properties and molecular structures. This approach separates the molecular structures of drug candidates into several fragments described by physicochemical parameters of the molecular fragments, allowing for the clear display of small modifications on individual fragments.",PMC5642577,PMC5642577_0
"The 2l-pca predictor possesses two prediction coefficient sets, {a_k} for properties and {b_l} for fragments, which can be solved in an iterative procedure with self-learning ability and information feed-back function. This iterative procedure enhances the prediction power of 2l-pca and promotes its ability for principal component analysis (PCA).",PMC5642577,PMC5642577_1
The approach is able to significantly improve the drug candidates in both the structure and property due to its information from both the structures of molecular fragments and the physicochemical properties.,PMC5642577,PMC5642577_2
"The paper highlights the advantages of 2l-pca, including its ability to separate molecular structures into fragments described by physicochemical parameters, its iterative procedure with self-learning ability and information feed-back function, and its ability to enhance the prediction power of PCA.",PMC5642577,PMC5642577_3
"The paper notes that user-friendly web servers, as given in recent publications, will significantly enhance the impacts of predictors or any computational tools by attracting the broad experimental scientists. The authors state that they will do their best to establish a web server for 2l-pca as soon as possible, with an announcement made through a publication or their webpage.",PMC5642577,PMC5642577_4
