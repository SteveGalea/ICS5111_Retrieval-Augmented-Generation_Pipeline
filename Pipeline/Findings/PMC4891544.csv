"Case report: A 39-year-old pregnant woman with gestational diabetes at 35 + 4 weeks was admitted with MERS-CoV at the obstetrics ward. She developed severe myalgia and fever on day 8, and her chest X-ray revealed patchy opacity in both lower lobes with bronchopneumonia. The patient recovered, but suddenly experienced bleeding and abdominal pain on day 22, and was diagnosed with placental abruption.",PMC4891544,PMC4891544_0
"Discussion: The decision to perform an emergency C-section was made due to sudden placental abruption, as the patient was not actively bleeding and only had moderate variability in fetal heart rate (FHR) without deceleration. The surgery was performed under regional anesthesia (RA) due to the patient's history of MERS-CoV and the potential for high-risk procedures during an infectious disease outbreak period. The patient's sputum was MERS-CoV negative before delivery, but it is unclear if strict precautions were necessary due to the patient's recent illness onset within 2 weeks.",PMC4891544,PMC4891544_1
"Discussion: All deliveries for patients with MERS or SARS should be managed in a designated negative-pressure isolation room by designated personnel with specialized infection control personal protective equipment (PPE) to minimize exposure and transmission. Modifications were made to minimize outflow of contaminated air, and all medical staff involved in the delivery remained healthy.",PMC4891544,PMC4891544_2
"Discussion: Placental abruption occurred in this case, but the reasons for the good outcome are unclear. Most human infections result from human-to-human spread, and when particular medical procedures are combined with poor infection control, the virus can disseminate within the hospital. Early and strict infection control strategies and clinical guidelines for infectious patients, such as those with MERS, should be established.",PMC4891544,PMC4891544_3
"Discussion: MERS is thought to be transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets and close human contact, but the mode is not completely defined. As the patient had pneumonia within 2 weeks, it is unclear if strict precautions were necessary due to the high infectivity and unknown transmission mode. No other case reports are available on delivering a baby for a woman with MERS, but several cases of labor and delivery in women with SARS have been published",PMC4891544,PMC4891544_4
