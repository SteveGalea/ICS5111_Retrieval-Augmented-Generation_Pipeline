"Redondoviruses, a previously unknown viral family, have been identified in human oroespiratory sites using next-generation sequencing technologies.",PMC6849504,PMC6849504_0
"These viruses are small, circular, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses of eukaryotic origin, containing rep and cp genes, and are highly conserved, suggesting they are not under significant immunologic pressure to mutate.",PMC6849504,PMC6849504_1
"Redondoviruses are highly prevalent in humans, particularly in patients with critical illness, oropharyngeal samples, and periodontal disease, and are associated with members of the anelloviridae family, another recently discovered viral family.",PMC6849504,PMC6849504_2
"The role of redondoviruses in human health and disease is unclear, but the study suggests a potential viral-bacterial interaction in periodontal disease.",PMC6849504,PMC6849504_3
"The current study does not address Koch's postulates, but the identification of this previously uncharacterized family of viruses opens the door for further investigation into their role in human disease.",PMC6849504,PMC6849504_4
