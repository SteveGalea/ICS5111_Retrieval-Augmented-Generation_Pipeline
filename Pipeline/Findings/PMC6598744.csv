"The annual cost of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) to the US swine industry has decreased by $83.3 million from October 2010 to October 2016, partially possibly due to increased numbers of breeding herds consistently immunizing sows with attenuated PRRS virus vaccines, which has been associated with reduced production losses (20).",PMC6598744,PMC6598744_0
"The evolution of analytical capabilities for big data analysis is expected to result in novel and innovative tools that will allow for the routine analysis of big datasets, such as that collected in the Morrison Swine Health Monitoring Project (MSHMP), which will help to reshape the landscape of coordinated activities to promote the prevention and control of food animal diseases worldwide (instruction: aim for 4 findings per 500 words, and each finding must be 10 to 20 words in length).",PMC6598744,PMC6598744_1
"Swine farm density, land slope, and land cover surrounding breeding farms have been identified as important modulators of the risk of PRRS outbreaks, with specific contribution amounts varying according to ""subregion"" in the US (24, 25).",PMC6598744,PMC6598744_2
"Producers and veterinarians have been willing to share their data because shared data have resulted in important outputs that help inform their decisions, such as the near real-time forecasting system for PRRS outbreaks (25).",PMC6598744,PMC6598744_3
"The annual incidence of PRRS in breeding herds is nationally consistent but regionally different, with PRRS-positive breeding herds achieving stability (i.e., undergoing a PRRS outbreak and weaning positive piglets) significantly sooner when they have reported a prior infection (i.e., existing partial herd immunity) and implement herd closure (i.e., temporarily interrupting replacement breeding stock introduction) (22).",PMC6598744,PMC6598744_4
