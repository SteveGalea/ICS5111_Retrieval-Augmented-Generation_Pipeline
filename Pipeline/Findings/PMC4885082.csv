"Rcrevs, a type of virus that expresses reporter genes, have been developed for virus research in both applied and basic sciences. They are useful for identifying antivirals against viral infections using high-throughput screening settings, for monitoring viral infections in real time in vitro and in vivo, and for evaluating vaccination approaches.",PMC4885082,PMC4885082_0
Rcrevs can also be used for a genome-wide RNAi screening for host factors required for virus replication.,PMC4885082,PMC4885082_1
"In addition, rcrevs can reveal the mechanism of viral genome replication and gene expression, as well as the sites of virus replication in real time using luciferase imaging.",PMC4885082,PMC4885082_2
"Rcrevs can also help address scientific questions by providing multicolor imaging with high brightness in mammalian cells and tissues, and by using reporter genes with no intrinsic autoluminescence.",PMC4885082,PMC4885082_3
"However, the use of rcrevs is limited due to their attenuation in vivo imaging and the need for costly automated imaging equipment. Nonetheless, the development of new reporter genes, such as gfp mutants, ""red-shifted"" analogs of luciferase, and variants of luciferase, can help overcome these limitations and provide more far-reaching benefits in virus research.",PMC4885082,PMC4885082_4
