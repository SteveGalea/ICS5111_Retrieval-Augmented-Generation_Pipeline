"Ole and Ht inhibit the fusion-promoting refolding of gp41, a hydrophobic pocket on the inner core of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, by binding to it. This pocket is highly conserved among different HIV-1 clades, and ole and Ht are active against a panel of HIV-1 primary isolates that includes both M and T tropic strains from different clades.",PMC2790717,PMC2790717_0
"Ole and Ht are small molecules with molecular weights of 539 and 153, respectively, and their inhibition of the fusion-promoting refolding of gp41 is an excellent example of how small molecules can block formation of protein-protein complexes.",PMC2790717,PMC2790717_1
"Ole and Ht can also be easily prepared from natural olive leaf extract in only two steps: deglycosylation and oxidation, or by chemical synthesis involving only two steps: acetylation and reduction.",PMC2790717,PMC2790717_2
The fact that ole and Ht act both outside and inside of the cellular environments in viral entry and integration offers unique benefits to these small molecules against viral resistance.,PMC2790717,PMC2790717_3
"Ole and Ht may be useful against other viruses with type I transmembrane envelope glycoprotein, including SARS-associated coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola virus, measles virus, and avian flu virus. Fuzeon, the only FDA-approved HIV-1 fusion inhibitor, is a peptide derived from the chr region of gp41 that partially overlaps with the C34 sequence. However, its manufacturing process is very complex, involving 106 chemical steps.",PMC2790717,PMC2790717_4
