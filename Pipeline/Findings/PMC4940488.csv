"The study evaluated the analytical sensitivity and specificity of six real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including the PowerChek MERS-CoV RT-PCR Kit, the AccuPower MERS-CoV RT-PCR Kit, the LightMix MERS-CoV RT-PCR Kit, the UltraFast MERS-CoV RT-PCR Kit, the DiaplexQ MERS-CoV RT-PCR Kit, and the Anyplex II MERS-CoV RT-PCR Kit.",PMC4940488,PMC4940488_0
"The study found that the overall clinical sensitivity and specificity of the individual kits were sufficient for diagnosing MERS-CoV infection, but the performance of the individual kits could be improved in terms of their analytical sensitivity, and identification of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibition with the use of appropriate internal controls is essential.",PMC4940488,PMC4940488_1
"The study showed that the LightMix MERS-CoV RT-PCR Kit demonstrated a trailing tendency to yield positive results down to much lower concentrations than its limit of detection (LOD) and an uncertain result to even a known-negative specimen, suggesting that the effort to increase sensitivity may result in more uncertainty and negatively impact specificity.",PMC4940488,PMC4940488_2
"The study found that the clinical sensitivity of the individual kits could be significantly affected by the presence of PCR inhibitors, and analytical sensitivity may be affected by PCR inhibition-prone specimens such as sputum specimens, highlighting the need for optimization of the pretreatment and RNA extraction procedures to improve the sensitivity of MERS-CoV molecular diagnostics, especially for testing sputum specimens.",PMC4940488,PMC4940488_3
"The study also showed that the PowerChek MERS-CoV RT-PCR Kit was less affected by the inhibition, as only PowerChek detected 50% of known-positive specimens when testing clinical sensitivity in the presence of PCR inhibitors, which is consistent with the fact that the PowerChek kit uses a less sensitive internal control that is intrinsic to human cells.",PMC4940488,PMC4940488_4
