"The study identifies the minimal essential elements required for the assembly of alphavirus replication complexes (RCs) and the formation of membrane-bound replication factories (RFs). These elements include the viral replication protein, nsp7, and the viral genomic RNA, as well as specific membrane-shaping proteins such as the host cell protein nup137.",PMC5571266,PMC5571266_0
"The study demonstrates that alphavirus RCs and RFs can be formed in the absence of other viral proteins, indicating that these structures are autonomously generated in response to the presence of nsp7 and viral genomic RNA.",PMC5571266,PMC5571266_1
"The study shows that the alphavirus nsp7 protein can interact with specific membrane-shaping proteins such as nup137, which are involved in the formation of RFs. This interaction is essential for the assembly and function of the RCs and RFs.",PMC5571266,PMC5571266_2
"The study also identifies a role for the alphavirus nsp7 protein in the recruitment of other viral proteins to the RCs and RFs, as well as the recruitment of cellular proteins and RNAs involved in translation and mRNA metabolism.",PMC5571266,PMC5571266_3
"The study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the assembly and function of RCs and RFs, which are critical for the replication and propagation of alphaviruses, and may have implications for the development of antiviral therapies.",PMC5571266,PMC5571266_4
