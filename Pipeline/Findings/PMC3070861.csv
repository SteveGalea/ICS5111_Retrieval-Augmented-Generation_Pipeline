"The study found that rhinovirus (HRV) infection is a common cause of bronchiolitis and urinary tract infection (URI) in previously healthy term infants, with HRVC being a newly described HRV group that is more commonly seen in black infants compared to HRVA or HRVB.",PMC3070861,PMC3070861_0
"The study identified HRVB infection as being associated with more severe disease in univariate analyses, and maternal asthma history was found to confer more than twice the risk of more severe HRV-associated infant disease.",PMC3070861,PMC3070861_1
"The study found that HRVC infection was associated with a longer duration of hospitalization compared to HRVA or HRVB infection, and that HRVC infection was more common in black infants compared to HRVA or HRVB infection.",PMC3070861,PMC3070861_2
"The study found that HRVC infection was more commonly seen in the fall, while HRVA infection was more commonly seen in the fall and winter, suggesting possible viral interference or serological cross-protection between HRVA and HRVC.",PMC3070861,PMC3070861_3
"The study found that hRV infection was frequently associated with bronchiolitis and clinically significant URI in previously healthy term infants, and predominant HRVC and HRVA groups varied by season and year, with substantial genetic diversity.",PMC3070861,PMC3070861_4
