"The quantitative proteomics analysis identified 74 differentially expressed host proteins in response to sars-cov replication, with 14 of them also found to be altered at the mRNA level. This study represents a complementary strategy for understanding the mechanisms by which sars-cov replicates in host cells, as previous studies have shown an approximately 60 to 80% discordance between mRNA and protein abundances.",PMC2876644,PMC2876644_0
"Among all differentially expressed host proteins, significantly upregulated bag3, a member of the bag cochaperone protein family, was selected for further functional studies. Bag3 knockdown results in greatly diminished virus replication, suggesting the possibility that upregulation of bag3 may be part of the machinery that sars-cov relies on for replication.",PMC2876644,PMC2876644_1
"Other proteins of interest uncovered in this study include 14-3-3 proteins, which have emerged as critical regulators of diverse cellular responses in eukaryotic organisms. The increase in 14-3-3 protein expression is likely part of the cell's response to sars-cov replication and appears to represent a homeostatic mechanism for cell defense.",PMC2876644,PMC2876644_2
"Two regulatory molecules, cdc42 and RhoA, were found to be downregulated in replicon cells. Modulation of sars-cov replication by cdc42 and RhoA may be mediated by the PI3K-mTOR pathway, which is important for establishing persistent sars-cov infection in Vero E6 cells.",PMC2876644,PMC2876644_3
"The quantitative proteomics analysis identified many host factors that potentially affect sars-cov replication, including 40S ribosomal subunits, 60S ribosomal subunits, and eIF2s1, eIF5B, and eIF4A2. Downregulation of the host translational machinery may play an important role in sars-cov replication in host cells.",PMC2876644,PMC2876644_4
