"According to the discussion structure presented, a significant relationship was found between city centrality and local transitivity, as well as between centrality and mortality rate during the black death pandemic in medieval networks. Cities with high centrality and transitivity were found to have higher rates of mortality due to the higher recurrence of reinfection events, indicating the occurrence of a synergistic effect of multiple infections with different strains.",PMC5338018,PMC5338018_0
"The spatio-temporal autocorrelation in mortality rate was explored by fitting spatially-explicit generalised linear models in each city, allowing cities to be repeatedly infected without recovering from the diseases. This model describes how the plague moved among medieval cities following the trading and pilgrimage network, and the transmission of the diseases was given by the contact network among cities.",PMC5338018,PMC5338018_1
"Using a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (sis) epidemic model, the spreading of the black death was simulated along the medieval network, with the epidemic starting from central Asian cities, and the probability of infection was found to depend on the number of infected cities contacting with the focal city multiplied by the transmission rate of the disease.",PMC5338018,PMC5338018_2

"The spread of the black death was simulated along the medieval network using a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (sis) epidemic model, starting from central Asian cities. The probability of infection was found to depend on the number of infected cities contacting with the focal city multiplied by the transmission rate of the disease, ranging from a transmission rate of 0.05 (very low infectivity rate) to 0.95 (very high infectivity rate). The epidemic was simulated by performing 1000 simulations for each infectivity scenario in each simulation. The black death was started in all simulations from central Asian cities.",PMC5338018,PMC5338018_4
