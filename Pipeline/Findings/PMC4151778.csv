"The study identified two distinct receptor-binding domains (RBDs) in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses: the original RBD, which binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and a second RBD, which binds to bat ACE2 orthologs.",PMC4151778,PMC4151778_0
"The researchers found that a previously uncharacterized bat ACE2 ortholog, bat ACE2b, can also serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 viruses, but with lower affinity compared to the ortholog from the horse shrew (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) or Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinensis).",PMC4151778,PMC4151778_1
"The study showed that the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, but not that of SARS-CoV, can be cleaved by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) expressed in human airway epithelial cells, which is a prerequisite for efficient virus entry into human cells.",PMC4151778,PMC4151778_2
"The researchers found that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, but not that of SARS-CoV, can be cleaved by cathepsin L (CTL) in human cells, which is another prerequisite for efficient virus entry into human cells.",PMC4151778,PMC4151778_3
"The study demonstrated that a human ACE2-overexpressing cell line is permissive to infection by SARS-CoV-2 viruses, but not by SARS-CoV viruses, and that this cell line supports efficient replication of SARS-CoV-2 viruses.",PMC4151778,PMC4151778_4
