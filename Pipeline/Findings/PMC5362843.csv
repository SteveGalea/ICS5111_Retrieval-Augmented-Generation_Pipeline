This case report describes a rare clinical presentation in a cat with primary bronchial carcinoma associated with bone marrow micrometastasis and paraneoplastic monoclonal gammopathy.,PMC5362843,PMC5362843_0
"The cat presented with signs of lung cancer, including appetite loss, dysphagia, weight loss, lethargy, and coughing. Thoracic radiographs revealed a lung mass with pleural effusion and megaesophagus.",PMC5362843,PMC5362843_1
"Histopathological examination of the lung mass revealed a heavily infiltrated lymphocyte and plasma cell population in the epithelial proliferation, consistent with tertiary lymphoid structures (tls).",PMC5362843,PMC5362843_2
"A bone marrow aspirate obtained under sedation revealed an abnormal infiltration of numerous clustered epithelial cells with a high n/c ratio, fine chromatin, and a foamy vacuolated background.",PMC5362843,PMC5362843_3
"Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a narrow spike in the gamma region, consistent with monoclonal gammopathy, with a serum concentration of 5.6 g/dl, and the cat's overall health status was poor, leading to euthanasia 2 months after initial presentation.",PMC5362843,PMC5362843_4
"The authors suggest that bone marrow evaluation should be considered during the staging of cats with epithelial tumors, as dtcs may remain quiescent in bone marrow for long periods before being activated to form metastases, particularly given the paucity of data regarding metastasis of epithelial tumors to bone marrow in feline patients.",PMC5362843,PMC5362843_5
"The authors also describe a narrow band for gamma globulins associated with pulmonary carcinoma in a cat, which is suggestive of monoclonal immunoglobulin production, particularly of IgG, although the authors do not confirm the involvement of IL-6 in tumor progression due to the lack of measurement of IL-6 serum concentration in the cat.",PMC5362843,PMC5362843_6
"The authors suggest that IL-6 may have played a dual role in the cat's case: first by supporting the dissemination of micrometastases in bone marrow, and second by participating in the loop maintenance of B-cell clone activation, resulting in the production of monoclonal",PMC5362843,PMC5362843_7
