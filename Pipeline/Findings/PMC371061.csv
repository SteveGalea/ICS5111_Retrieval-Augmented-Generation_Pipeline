"In response to neurotropic viral infections, brain immune cells, such as astrocytes and microglia, produce a more elaborate proinflammatory immune response, including up-regulation of a set of five proinflammatory cytokines, than in response to nonneurotropic viral infections. This differential immune response is parallel to the th1 proinflammatory response of T-helper lymphocytes and is crucial for the development of inflammatory demyelinating diseases.",PMC371061,PMC371061_0
"The proinflammatory cytokine response to neurotropic viral infections consists of cytokines, such as IL-12, TNF-α, IL-15, IL-6, and IL-1β, that would normally be associated with the recruitment of inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and macrophages, to the site of infection. These cytokines contribute to the characteristic manifestations of encephalitis and the disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which facilitates additional dissemination of the virus within the CNS.",PMC371061,PMC371061_1
The differential immune response to neurotropic and nonneurotropic viral infections is consistent with the idea that cytokine induction is a pivotal factor in the development of an inflammatory CNS disease. This differential response is important because it has many similarities with the human demyelinating disease MS and has been reported in MS and other animal models of MS.,PMC371061,PMC371061_2
"IL-12 induction involves innate immune responses in viral and autoimmune conditions, such as theiler's virus encephalomyelitis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and experimental colitis. IL-15 mediates T-cell responses and innate activity and is also known as an inducer of additional TNF-α. IL-6 is a cytokine frequently induced by TNF-α and other proinflammatory regulatory molecules and has been associated with neurotropic viral infections, EAE, and other autoimmune conditions of the CNS.",PMC371061,PMC371061_3
