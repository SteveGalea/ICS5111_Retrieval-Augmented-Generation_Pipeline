"In the UK, a ""male preference policy"" for plasma donation results in the exclusion of women as risky plasma donors, regardless of age, reproductive history, or antibody status. This policy constructs all women as potentially compromised in terms of their immune status because of their potential exposure to a fetal body, which affects their suitability to become plasma donors.",PMC4467286,PMC4467286_0
"The production of anti-D immunoglobulin (IG) in the UK is mainly carried out using plasma from male rHD negative donors, as it is considered to be a risky product for women of rHD negative pregnancies. Many women receive anti-D IG when it is unnecessary, as they may not need it if they are carrying an rHD negative fetus.",PMC4467286,PMC4467286_1
"In Ireland, a national audit of anti-D IG use revealed that the product is administered unnecessarily to many women, as they are wrongly transfused with rHD positive blood. Women of rHD negative pregnancies are excluded from becoming donors for the product, or having access to additional payments for such donations.",PMC4467286,PMC4467286_2
"In Canada, a study on anti-D IG use in pregnant women found that 60 women received the product when it was unnecessary. The study also revealed that anti-D IG is produced mainly from male rHD negative donors for use in pregnant and parturient women.",PMC4467286,PMC4467286_3
"The production of anti-D IG involves injecting male rHD negative plasma donors' with rHD positive cells to produce antibodies, which is an accepted and valued practice in transfusion science. Women of reproductive age are usually excluded from becoming donors for the product or having access to additional payments for such donations. Many women receive anti-D IG when it is unnecessary, as they may not need it if they are carrying an rHD negative fetus. In contrast, the commercial production of anti-D IG by injecting male rHD negative plasma donors' with rHD positive cells to produce antibodies is an accepted and valued practice in transfusion science. Women of reproductive age are usually excluded from becoming donors for the product or having access to additional payments for such donations.",PMC4467286,PMC4467286_4
