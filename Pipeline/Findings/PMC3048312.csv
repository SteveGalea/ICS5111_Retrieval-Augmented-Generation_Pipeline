"Plastid engineering has shown high-level expression (up to 40% of the plant's total soluble protein (tsp)) of antimicrobial proteins against pneumonia streptococcus pneumoniae, the causative agent of pneumonia [116].",PMC3048312,PMC3048312_0
"Plastid-based vaccine against cholera has been successfully produced, with the fragment c of the tetanus toxin (tetc) encoding the protective antigen (pa) from the tobacco plastid genome giving rise to stable antigen protein [112, 113].",PMC3048312,PMC3048312_1
"Different constructs for expressing hiv-1 nef and p24 antigens in plant cells have been designed, and transplastomic lines in tobacco and tomato have been analyzed. Protein accumulation was found to be close to 40% of the leafâ€™s total protein in green tomatoes [115].",PMC3048312,PMC3048312_2
"Plastid-based vaccine against classical swine fever virus (csfv) has been assessed by McCabe et al. [119], and the structural protein e2 of csfv has been shown to carry critical epitopes cfsv e2 gene in tobacco chloroplasts [118].",PMC3048312,PMC3048312_3
Plastid engineering has been proved efficient for high-yield production of the vaccinia virus envelope protein a27l in plant cells [121].,PMC3048312,PMC3048312_4
