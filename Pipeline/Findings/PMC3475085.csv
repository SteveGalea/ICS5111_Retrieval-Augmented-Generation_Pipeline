"The study analyzed gene expression profiles in the blood of patients with severe respiratory illness due to acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and found an intense activity of neutrophil proteases, including elastase (ELANE), cathepsin G (CTSG), and cathepsin D (CTSD), in COPD patients with critical respiratory illness.",PMC3475085,PMC3475085_0
"The study also identified genes involved in antimicrobial defense but that could also mediate tissue damage in the lungs, such as mucin 1 (MUC1) and myeloperoxidase (MPO).",PMC3475085,PMC3475085_1
"The study found that the expression of immune-related genes, such as peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1), was decreased in COPD patients with critical respiratory illness.",PMC3475085,PMC3475085_2
"The study also identified genes involved in the response to hypoxia, such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and genes involved in antibacterial defense, such as defensin, alpha 3 (DEFENSIN, ALPHA 3, NEUTROPHIL-SPECIFIC) (DEFA3) and azurocidin 1 (AZU1).",PMC3475085,PMC3475085_3
"The study found that the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as interleukin-6 (IL6), and genes involved in the regulation of inflammation, such as suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), was increased in COPD patients with critical respiratory illness.",PMC3475085,PMC3475085_4
