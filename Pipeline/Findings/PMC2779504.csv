"In a study published in section 4 of [163], the author reports that mathematical models can provide valuable insights into the transmission of infectious diseases like measles and influenza. These models can help to identify key factors that drive disease spread, such as the heterogeneity of contacts and the role of super-spreaders in outbreaks. The author also notes that mathematical modeling can aid in the design and evaluation of vaccination strategies.",PMC2779504,PMC2779504_0
"A correspondingly strong link between mathematics and epidemiology is currently emerging, as evidenced by the increasing mathematical content in undergraduate education in the biological sciences. This development is expected to lead to significant progress in epidemiological modeling.",PMC2779504,PMC2779504_1
"In the context of [163], the author highlights the importance of mathematical modeling in the context of HIV/AIDS, which is a disease with complex scientific properties. The author notes that mathematical modeling can help to understand the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS, as well as identify factors that contribute to disease spread, such as the heterogeneity of contacts and the role of super-spreaders in outbreaks.",PMC2779504,PMC2779504_2
"Another important finding from the context of [163] is the role of mathematical modeling in the context of HIV/AIDS in resource-constrained settings. The author notes that mathematical modeling can help to identify strategies for optimizing the use of resources in HIV/AIDS treatment and management, particularly in resource-constrained settings where resources may be limited.",PMC2779504,PMC2779504_3
"In the context of [142], the author discusses the challenges associated with the availability and distribution of resources for managing HIV/AIDS. The author notes that mathematical modeling can help to identify strategies for optimizing the use of resources in HIV/AIDS treatment and management, particularly in resource-constrained settings where resources may be limited. The author also highlights the importance of addressing the scientific properties of HIV/AIDS, such as its complexity and variability, in the context of resource-constrained settings.",PMC2779504,PMC2779504_4
