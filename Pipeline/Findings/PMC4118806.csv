"The authors successfully crystallized the hcov-nl63 main protease in complex with the michael acceptor n3, which belongs to space group p41212 with two molecules per asymmetric unit.",PMC4118806,PMC4118806_0
"The authors identified two molecules per asymmetric unit in the crystals, corresponding to a matthews coefficient and solvent content of 3.06 Å³3 da−1 and 59.8%, respectively.",PMC4118806,PMC4118806_1
The authors initially attempted to crystallize the apo-form of hcov-nl63 main protease but faced challenges with most crystals cracking.,PMC4118806,PMC4118806_2
"The authors turned to an alternative method to co-crystallize the protease with the michael acceptor n3, which resulted in the successful crystallization of the protein complex.",PMC4118806,PMC4118806_3
Further structural and functional analysis of the hcov-nl63 main protease in complex with the michael acceptor n3 will lead to better design and optimization of this lead drug against hcov-nl63-associated diseases.,PMC4118806,PMC4118806_4
