"The study confirmed the seasonal tendency of pediatric henoch-sch√∂nlein purpura (HSP) in South Korea, which is age-dependent and related to exposure of infectious agents.",PMC6133644,PMC6133644_0
"The study found that the occurrence of HSP in South Korea shows a seasonal tendency, with a higher incidence in spring and less in summer, particularly in August.",PMC6133644,PMC6133644_1
"The study identified epidemiological patterns of HSP related to exposure of specific respiratory or enteric viruses, such as rotavirus, norovirus, and bocavirus, in different age groups.",PMC6133644,PMC6133644_2
"The study suggests the possibility of a novel pathogen associated with HSP, as it confirmed the coincidence of HSP and some viruses that were not previously linked to HSP, such as rotavirus, norovirus, and bocavirus.",PMC6133644,PMC6133644_3
"The study highlights the need for further long-term epidemiological studies to confirm the exact causal relationships through investigation and analysis of data, as the study is the first to investigate an association between the occurrence of HSP and outbreaks of different viruses using the national health data.",PMC6133644,PMC6133644_4
