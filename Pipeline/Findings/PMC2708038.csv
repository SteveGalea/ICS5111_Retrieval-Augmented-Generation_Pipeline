"The study reports the first structural characterization of the x-domain of the human coronavirus (HCoV) strain ibv, which is associated with the common cold.",PMC2708038,PMC2708038_0
"The x-domain structure reveals a unique conformational state not previously observed in other coronavirus strains, including the human coronavirus strain NL63 and mouse hepatitis virus.",PMC2708038,PMC2708038_1
"The study also provides insights into the role of the x-domain in adenosine-diphosphate-ribose binding, which is critical for viral replication and survival.",PMC2708038,PMC2708038_2
"The study highlights the importance of adenosine-diphosphate-ribose in the virulence and pathogenicity of HCoVs, and suggests potential therapeutic targets for the development of antiviral agents.",PMC2708038,PMC2708038_3
"The study also provides a better understanding of the structural basis for the differential host range of HCoVs, which may aid in the development of strategies for controlling the spread of these viruses.",PMC2708038,PMC2708038_4
