"In cancer research, a better understanding of cell death mechanisms is crucial for improving drug discovery processes. This is because the correct evaluation of cell death in every experimental setting related to cancer research is a must for understanding therapeutic failure, treatment-related side effects, and even providing susceptibility markers.",PMC5392044,PMC5392044_0
"In the specific field of antisarcoma therapy, the assessment of cell death mechanisms is required to understand chemoresistance and cell death immunogenic potential. Several clinical trials that evaluate target therapies in sarcomas regarding apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe are still ongoing.",PMC5392044,PMC5392044_1
"In the innovative concept of immunogenic cell death, the induction of this form of death through nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems may lead to potential therapy in pancreatic cancer.",PMC5392044,PMC5392044_2
"In the assessment of cell death processes, it is essential to possess strong cell death assays to explore the potential role of immunogenic cell death in nanomedicines. Studies largely recommend not using a single method, for having both quantitative and qualitative data.",PMC5392044,PMC5392044_3
"In the detection of cell death, the main drawback of apoptosis-specific and necrosis-specific assays is that neither of these assays can provide unequivocal information on the occurrence of one specific cell death modality compared with the other. Similarly, a reliable method for the detection of autophagy has not yet been developed. Additional clonogenicity and viability assays are necessary so as to correctly assess cell death pathways, as apoptosis often occurs very quickly, whereas necrosis is much slower.",PMC5392044,PMC5392044_4
