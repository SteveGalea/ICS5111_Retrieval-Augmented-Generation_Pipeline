"This study utilized a large, genetically diverse mouse population to investigate interindividual variability in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of perchloroethylene (PCE).",PMC5726344,PMC5726344_0
"The study found that interindividual variability in PCE toxicokinetics is complex and highly variable, with a significant effect of PCE exposure on a number of toxicodynamic parameters, but not all of these parameters were correlated with hepatic PCE levels.",PMC5726344,PMC5726344_1
"The study also demonstrated dysregulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis, including accumulation of liver triglycerides, as a consequence of PCE exposure.",PMC5726344,PMC5726344_2
"The study found that interindividual differences in toxicokinetics of PCE and tetrachloroethylene (TCE) may be only partially responsible for the variability in the toxicity of these chlorinated solvents, and that additional research is needed to determine whether genetic modifiers may account for these differences.",PMC5726344,PMC5726344_3
"The study suggested that there is some relationship among PCE, TCE, and hepatic triglyceride accumulation, but at the population level, the correlation between metabolism and cyp2e1 was weak.",PMC5726344,PMC5726344_4
