"The discovery of hcov-nl63 and other novel human coronaviruses does not necessarily represent a sudden increase in emerging infections by 'new' coronaviruses, as viral agents causing upper respiratory tract infections were isolated from patients and shown to be coronaviruses by electron microscopy in the early 1960s.",PMC2918871,PMC2918871_0
"Molecular clock analysis, used to measure the evolutionary divergence of species, assumes a roughly constant substitution rate for a species' genome. The reliability of molecular dating is dependent on the validity of this hypothesis, and with an average substitution rate for coronaviruses estimated to be 10-4 substitutions per year per site, molecular dating has shown that hcov-nl63 has been present in the human population for centuries.",PMC2918871,PMC2918871_1
"Cross-reactive antibody responses to other human coronaviruses, including hcov-nl63, have been reported, and this cross-reactivity is most likely due to the presence of cross-reactive antigenic epitopes of the coronaviruses.",PMC2918871,PMC2918871_2
"Improved molecular and cell biology techniques have aided in identifying three 'new' human coronaviruses, improving our understanding of the classification of the coronaviruses. The assembly of a full-length infectious hcov-nl63 clone has also been reported, which will make the study of this virus easier, improving our understanding of the role of each of the proteins encoded by the hcov-nl63 genome.",PMC2918871,PMC2918871_3
"The discovery of these 'new' human coronaviruses, including hcov-nl63, has shown that only sars-cov has recently been introduced to the human population from an animal source, while hcov-nl63 has been circulating in humans for a while. This highlights the need to develop further molecular and cell biology techniques to make the sensitive and accurate detection of coronaviruses in clinical samples possible, as the prevailing view that they are only involved in mild respiratory tract infections needs to be further explored to elucidate the link, if any, between human coronaviruses and human diseases of the respiratory tract, the vascular system, the central nervous system, and the gastrointestinal tract.",PMC2918871,PMC2918871_4
