"High prevalence of streptococcus pyogenes infection in patients with pharyngitis varies widely in the Asia-Pacific region, ranging from 0 to 28%. This variation is due to differences in patient selection criteria, age, season, and laboratory methods.",PMC4399404,PMC4399404_0
"Antibiotic prescribing rates for pharyngitis in the Asia-Pacific region are highly variable, with overprescribing reported in China, Thailand, and Korea. Antibiotic choices may also be inappropriate in some countries, such as frequent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in Japan.",PMC4399404,PMC4399404_1
"Patient, healthcare provider, and healthcare system factors contribute to overprescription of antibiotics for respiratory infections. Patient factors include excessive patient expectation, lack of knowledge or misconception about antibiotics' effectiveness, and financial incentives. Healthcare provider factors include diagnostic uncertainty, fear of complications or medico-legal problems, and lack of communication skills. Health system factors include cost constraints, lack of rapid laboratory tests, and patient overload.",PMC4399404,PMC4399404_2
"Interventions to reduce antibiotic prescribing for respiratory infections have been done in the Asia-Pacific region, but narrow scope interventions focusing on key steps of the point-of-care using diagnostic aids and fairly straightforward management strategies have demonstrated effectiveness. Multi-faceted interventions combining parent education with clinician behavior change have also decreased antibiotic prescribing rates by between 6 and 21%.",PMC4399404,PMC4399404_3
"Health insurance system implementation in low and medium income countries may improve access to medicines, but evidence on its positive impact on appropriate medicine utilization is limited. A multi-prong approach by governments, health training institutions, professional societies, pharmaceutical companies, consumer organizations, and international organizations is needed to promote judicious antibiotic use at the point-of-care through a multi-prong approach targeting patients/consumers, healthcare providers, and healthcare systems.",PMC4399404,PMC4399404_4
