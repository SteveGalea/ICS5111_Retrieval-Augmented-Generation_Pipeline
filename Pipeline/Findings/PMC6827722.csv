"A study in Lebanon found that viral infections are responsible for at least half of all acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children. Rhinovirus (RV) was the most common viral etiology, with a prevalence of 69.8%. Coxsackie and echovirus (CVEV) infection was also common, with a prevalence of 38.8%. Coinfections with multiple viruses were frequent, with 42.9% of all ARIs involving multiple viruses.",PMC6827722,PMC6827722_0
"CVEV infection was associated with a higher risk of rhinorrhea, a key symptom of ARIs, and was more common in younger children. This finding highlights the importance of testing for enteroviruses, including CVEV, in settings where ARIs are common.",PMC6827722,PMC6827722_1
"The study also found that patients coinfected with multiple viruses had a higher risk of rhinorrhea but not necessarily more severe symptoms. This finding adds to the growing body of evidence that the complexity of viral coinfections and their effects on disease outcomes are still not well understood, and further studies are needed to investigate the interactions between viruses during coinfection and their effects on host cells.",PMC6827722,PMC6827722_2
"The study found that children with coinfections had more frequent and severe ARIs than children with single viral infections. However, the effects of coinfections on disease severity and outcomes are not well understood, and more research is needed to investigate the interactions between viruses during coinfection and their effects on host cells.",PMC6827722,PMC6827722_3
