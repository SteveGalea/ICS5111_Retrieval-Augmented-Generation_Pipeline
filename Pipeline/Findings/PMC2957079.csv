"Coronaviruses encode accessory proteins and nucleocapsid (N) and replicase-associated nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) and nsp3 that inhibit interferon (IFN) induction and signaling, leading to immune evasion.",PMC2957079,PMC2957079_0
"IFN is detected in MHV-infected mice and humans with SARS, but cell type-specific differences in IFN expression after coronavirus infection exist.",PMC2957079,PMC2957079_1
"IFN is induced in macrophages and microglia via MDA5-dependent pathways, and oligodendrocyte cell lines via MDA5- and RIG-I-dependent pathways.",PMC2957079,PMC2957079_2
"Infection of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages contributes to the development of effective innate and adaptive immune responses, but macrophage infection can also lead to immunopathological disease and enhanced lethality.",PMC2957079,PMC2957079_3
"Most IFN produced after MHV infection is dependent on signaling through the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR), and IFN is critical for virus-induced upregulation of IFN-related molecules, including MDA5, RIG-I, and CXCL10.",PMC2957079,PMC2957079_4
