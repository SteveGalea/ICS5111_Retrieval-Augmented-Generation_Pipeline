The current study aimed to investigate the pathogenesis of dual infection with canine respiratory coronavirus (civ) and Bordetella bronchiseptica (s. equi subsp. Zooepidemicus) in dogs.,PMC3122572,PMC3122572_0
"The study found that severity of clinical disease, viral shedding, bacterial shedding, and lung pathology following experimental challenge with civ and s. equi subsp. Zooepidemicus was significantly higher in dual-infected dogs compared to dogs infected with either civ alone or s. equi subsp. Zooepidemicus alone.",PMC3122572,PMC3122572_1
"The study also showed that the severity of clinical disease, viral shedding, bacterial shedding, and lung pathology was significantly reduced in dogs infected with civ and s. equi subsp. Zooepidemicus and vaccinated with the civ (h3n8) vaccine.",PMC3122572,PMC3122572_2
"The study suggests that s. Equi subsp. Zooepidemicus is an opportunistic pathogen that contributes to the severity of canine infectious respiratory disease complex (cird) in dogs, particularly in dual infection with civ.",PMC3122572,PMC3122572_3
"The study highlights the importance of vaccination of dogs at risk for infection, such as those housed in shelters or kennels or those that are frequently boarded or go to dog day care and dog parks, to protect against civ and other secondary pathogens, and emphasizes the need for vaccination at least 3 weeks before exposure to civ.",PMC3122572,PMC3122572_4
