"The randomized clinical trial involved 200 children and adolescents with sickle cell disease who received either a monthly dose of 12,000 international units (IU) or 100,000 IU of oral vitamin D3.",PMC5941998,PMC5941998_0
"Both monthly standard- and high-dose vitamin D supplements raised 25-hydroxylated vitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations to sufficient levels, but only in the group receiving the high dose was the concentration consistently above the threshold for skeletal health.",PMC5941998,PMC5941998_1
"The annual rates of respiratory events, including respiratory infections, asthma exacerbations, and acute chest syndromes, decreased by >50% during year 2 of treatment in both the standard- and high-dose treatment groups, with similar magnitudes of reduction.",PMC5941998,PMC5941998_2
"Monthly standard- and high-dose vitamin D supplements were safe, with no significant differences in adverse events between the two groups.",PMC5941998,PMC5941998_3
"The trial results provide evidence for a substantial protective effect of vitamin D against sickle cell respiratory complications that was manifest only after a year of bolus administration, but daily administration would produce sustained increases in the concentration of circulating vitamin D3 and potentially show a more rapid protective effect, as well as differences in the response to standard- and high-dose treatments.",PMC5941998,PMC5941998_4
