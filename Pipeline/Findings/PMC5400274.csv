"This study provides evidence for the prevalence and genetic characteristics of Bartonella spp. In bat communities in Georgia, with over 95% nucleotide identity in some cases, suggesting the potential identification of new Bartonella species through a refined approach combining data from multiple genetic markers with ecological information about host specificity.",PMC5400274,PMC5400274_0
"The study highlights the importance of Bartonella surveillance in bats, as it can help to identify potential wildlife reservoirs of human cases and evaluate their role as potential zoonotic agents.",PMC5400274,PMC5400274_1
"The study reveals the identification of Bartonella strains in Georgian bats that are closely related to those identified in humans and in companion animals in other geographic areas, granting special attention in future studies to evaluate their role as potential zoonotic agents.",PMC5400274,PMC5400274_2
"The study suggests that some bat-associated Bartonella strains, identified in Georgian bats, may potentially represent new Bartonella species, as they share pairwise sequence identities with Bartonella strains previously described in humans and in companion animals in other geographic areas.",PMC5400274,PMC5400274_3
"The study provides insights into the potential spillover of Bartonella genogroups among bat hosts, as some Bartonella genogroups characterized in this study can be assigned to existing Bartonella species based on sequence identity >95% at the glta locus, but using this locus alone creates an artifactual split among the genogroups.",PMC5400274,PMC5400274_4
