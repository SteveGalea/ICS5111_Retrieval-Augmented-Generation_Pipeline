"The authors identified a conserved structural domain, called receptor binding domain (rbd), in the spike (S) glycoprotein of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that is essential for virus entry into host cells.",PMC4439384,PMC4439384_0
The rbd of MERS-CoV shares low levels of cross-reactivity with those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and other coronaviruses within and across subgroups.,PMC4439384,PMC4439384_1
The authors designed subunit vaccines by rational design based on the structural analysis of rbd of MERS-CoV s protein and by identification of the most stable and critical neutralizing fragment of rbd while eliminating non-neutralizing epitopes through immunofocusing.,PMC4439384,PMC4439384_2
"The authors found that small animal models for MERS-CoV infections are still lacking, but researchers have made great progress towards the identification and development of an effective small animal model for MERS-CoV infections.",PMC4439384,PMC4439384_3
"The authors emphasized that the development of effective vaccines is urgently needed to control the spread of emerging MERS-CoV infections, and subunit-based vaccines will offer the safest means for prevention. They also noted that the efficacy of current MERS-CoV vaccines can be significantly improved by rational design based on the structural analysis of rbd of MERS-CoV s protein and by identification of the most stable and critical neutralizing fragment of rbd while eliminating non-neutralizing epitopes through immunofocusing.",PMC4439384,PMC4439384_4
