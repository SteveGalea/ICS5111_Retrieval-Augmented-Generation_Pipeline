"The study found that chloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria, has antiviral activity against influenza A viruses.",PMC1878474,PMC1878474_0
"The study demonstrated that the antiviral activity of chloroquine is related to the low-pH dependent fusion of influenza A viruses, as the step of virus/cell interactions.",PMC1878474,PMC1878474_1
The study revealed that the antiviral activity of chloroquine is related to the electrostatic potential of the ha2 protein subunit of influenza A viruses.,PMC1878474,PMC1878474_2
"The study showed that the antiviral activity of chloroquine is related to the isoelectric point of the ha2 protein subunit of influenza A viruses, with higher antiviral activity observed in viruses with higher ha2 isoelectric points.",PMC1878474,PMC1878474_3
"The study found that the antiviral activity of chloroquine is related to the ph requirement of influenza A viruses, with higher antiviral activity observed in viruses with a lower ph requirement.",PMC1878474,PMC1878474_4
