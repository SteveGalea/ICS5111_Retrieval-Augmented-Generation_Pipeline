"The liposome-based immunoprecipitation system (lips) has been shown to have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to classic solid-phase assays for detecting antibodies against multiple antigens from different viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV).",PMC4306608,PMC4306608_0
"Lips has been used to identify novel infectious agents, such as HMOASTV-C, a nonprimate homolog of hepatitis C virus, in animals, and to determine their impact on health.",PMC4306608,PMC4306608_1
"Lips has allowed for the simultaneous measurement of antibody levels against multiple target proteins in infectious and autoimmune diseases, such as HIV, HCV, and EBV, in infected subjects compared to uninfected controls.",PMC4306608,PMC4306608_2
"Lips has been used to identify individual exposure profiles to multiple infectious agents, which may influence human health, and to define disease-specific antibody profiles in chronic diseases, such as HIV and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which may allow for the early detection of these diseases before clinical onset.",PMC4306608,PMC4306608_3
"Lips has the potential to provide in vivo evidence of infection, which may accelerate the discovery of new pathogens obtained from nucleic acid discovery efforts, by allowing for the identification of animal reservoirs of human-related viruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, which may cause zoonotic infections in humans.",PMC4306608,PMC4306608_4
