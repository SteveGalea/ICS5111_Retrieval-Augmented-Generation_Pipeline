"This study developed a model for screening agonists of the human TLR5-mediated NF-κB pathway using a human TLR5 cell model, which is more suitable for human therapeutic application than previous models used in other studies.",PMC3589936,PMC3589936_0
"The study found that branched polyethylenimine (PEI), a chemical compound with a molecular weight of ∼25 kDa, can activate the human TLR5-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner in this cell model.",PMC3589936,PMC3589936_1
"The study demonstrated that PEI has a significant protective effect against radiation injury in an animal model, as it prevented animal weight loss caused by γ-ray irradiation, significantly increased animal body weight over a period of 30 days, and improved animal quality of life, prolonged animal survival time, and reduced mortality.",PMC3589936,PMC3589936_2
"The study found that PEI provides advantages over flagellin protein, such as higher pharmacological specificity, requires a lower dose to achieve the same effect, is easier to deliver to its targets, and is stable in storage at room temperature.",PMC3589936,PMC3589936_3
"The study suggests that PEI, like flagellin protein, offers radiation protection, including, but not limited to, protecting cancer patients who receive radiotherapy or radiosurgery, and could serve as a new compound for protecting the health and safety of people in radiation-related accidents.",PMC3589936,PMC3589936_4
