Fmdv infection assays were carried out in huh7-lunet t7 cell lines using replicon rna derived from the infectious copy plasmid pt7s3 and a cvb3 renilla luciferase replicon. Transfected cells were incubated in the presence of enduren live cell renilla luciferase substrate and luminescence was measured using a plate reader.,PMC5156328,PMC5156328_0
"Infection of huh7-lunet t7 cell lines by fmdv and bev-1 was quantified using the 96-well plate assay. Cells were grown to 70% confluency, transfected with replicon rna, and incubated in the presence of renilla luciferase substrate.",PMC5156328,PMC5156328_1
"Simultaneous infection of huh7-lunet t7 cell lines by fmdv and bev-1 was quantified using the 96-well plate assay. Cells were grown to 70% confluency, infected with fmdv or bev-1, and incubated in the presence of renilla luciferase substrate.",PMC5156328,PMC5156328_2
"The proportion of infected huh7-lunet t7 cell lines was scored and normalized to control cells in the 96-well plate assay. Cells were grown to 70% confluency, transfected with replicon rna, and incubated in the presence of renilla luciferase substrate.",PMC5156328,PMC5156328_3
"Chemical inhibitors were added to the 96-well plate assay to study the effects of fmdv and bev-1 replication on huh7-lunet t7 cell lines. Cells were grown to 70% confluency, transfected with replicon rna, and incubated in the presence of renilla luciferase substrate and inhibitors.",PMC5156328,PMC5156328_4
