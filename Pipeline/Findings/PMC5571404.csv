"A new genus, deltacoronavirus, was added to the coronavirinae subfamily due to the discovery of diverse host species, including mammalian and avian species (1-3).",PMC5571404,PMC5571404_0
"PDCoV, a deltacoronavirus, was first detected in pigs with diarrhea in Ohio, USA, in 2014, and has since been identified in other states and Asian countries (5-12).",PMC5571404,PMC5571404_1
"In Japan, PDCoVs have frequently been detected in diarrheic domestic pigs since 2014, including a unique case in Hokkaido prefecture in September 2016 with approximately 280 piglet deaths (1).",PMC5571404,PMC5571404_2
"Comparative sequence analysis of the complete genome of the Hokkaido isolate showed 97.0-99.6% nt diversity to 49 reference strains from the USA, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam, indicating natural derivation from widespread PDCoVs in these regions since late 2013 (4-12).",PMC5571404,PMC5571404_3
"The Hokkaido isolate was closely related to PDCoV strains from the USA and South Korea detected in recent years and was divided into a separate branch from a Thai PDCoV with nt deletions and/or insertions, suggesting the possibility of genetic association with high mortality in piglets (10).",PMC5571404,PMC5571404_4
