"In the outbreak of MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea, most clinical laboratories had sufficient capacity to respond to the outbreak, with immediate testing available seven days a week. The median turnaround time for MERS-CoV RT-PCR testing was less than six hours, and results were reported within 24 hours in all medical institutions except one.",PMC4713849,PMC4713849_0
"The majority of clinical laboratories (75%) used phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for pretreatment of sputum specimens. Most laboratories (85%) used commercial lysis kits or systems for MERS-CoV RT-PCR testing, with the Kogenebiotech PowerChek MERS-CoV Real-Time PCR Kit being the most commonly used.",PMC4713849,PMC4713849_1
"In response to the MERS-CoV outbreak, class II biosafety cabinets were adequately supplied, but high-end engineering facilities such as negative pressure sputum collection and pretreatment rooms were not readily available. However, no laboratory-acquired infections were reported during the outbreak, indicating that standard precautions with droplet precautions were sufficient for the prevention of laboratory-acquired infection of MERS-CoV.",PMC4713849,PMC4713849_2
"The number of positive results from MERS-CoV RT-PCR testing was significantly higher in specimens obtained from the lower respiratory tract (1.01%) compared with specimens from the upper respiratory tract (0.6%). This highlights the importance of using lower respiratory tract specimens for MERS-CoV diagnosis, as recommended by the laboratory diagnostic guidelines for MERS-CoV testing in the Republic of Korea.",PMC4713849,PMC4713849_3
"The survey contributes to the comprehensive view of clinical laboratory responses to the recent MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea. The results suggest that clinical laboratories in Korea were able to expand their diagnostic capacity in a short time and achieve a turnaround time of less than nine hours, with testing available seven days a week, to respond to the MERS-CoV outbreak. However, improvements in engineering laboratory biosafety are needed for preparedness to test agents with a higher biosafety level.",PMC4713849,PMC4713849_4
