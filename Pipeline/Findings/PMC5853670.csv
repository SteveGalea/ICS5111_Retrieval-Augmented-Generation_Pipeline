A study of 14 ebola virus (EBOV) survivors from the 1976 Yambuku outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) found that four survivors had anti-EBOV neutralizing antibody responses 40 years after infection. Two of these survivors also demonstrated strong neutralization using a pseudo-type virus assay.,PMC5853670,PMC5853670_0
"The survivors with the greatest ability to neutralize live virus were the only health-care worker enrolled in the study and had multiple exposures to EBOV during the outbreak, including percutaneous exposure and contact with patient bodily fluids.",PMC5853670,PMC5853670_1
The study documented anti-EBOV immunity to viral antigens 40 years after the initial infection and demonstrated that a subset of survivors were still capable of neutralizing live virus in vitro.,PMC5853670,PMC5853670_2
The duration of the anti-EBOV humoral response filled a knowledge gap within the field and provided evidence that infection with EBOV can trigger a life-long humoral immune response and in instances neutralize live virus in vitro.,PMC5853670,PMC5853670_3
"The study highlights the need to develop effective therapeutics or vaccines that limit pathogenesis and viral spread, as currently there is a growing body of evidence that offers hope for finding ways to pharmacologically mimic or boost the natural resistance that some individuals appear to have towards EBOV infection.",PMC5853670,PMC5853670_4
