"In a study of the ventilation of a single-bed isolation room, it was found that turbulence within the room leads to a homogeneous concentration of any passive contaminant, which is then removed via the outlet vent. This explains the success of perfect mixing models observed in experiments and in other studies. The contribution from the body wake, caused by people moving, is comparable to the door swing mechanism and can be up to 10% of the room volume. The movement of exchanged air depends on whether the door opens into or out of the isolation room, and has been identified as a risk.",PMC2843951,PMC2843951_0
"In the same study, the exchange caused by doors opening and closing, and people moving, was estimated. The contribution from the body wake is comparable to the door swing mechanism and can be up to 10% of the room volume. Large droplets or particles sediment relative to the floor, and using a model that combines a Lagrangian analysis of droplet movement with a kinematic simulation of a pseudo turbulent flow, it was shown that while the mean fall velocity is largely unchanged, turbulence significantly enhances horizontal and vertical dispersion.",PMC2843951,PMC2843951_1

For typical values of u* and le found in the hospital environment, a droplet of d0 ≈ 30 μm will be spread a distance of 2 m, even without a mean flow.",PMC2843951,PMC2843951_2
