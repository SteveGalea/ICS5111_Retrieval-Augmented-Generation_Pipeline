"The study identified two human monoclonal antibodies (mabs), 2F9 and 1F7, that specifically recognize the dipeptidase (DPP) IV (DPP4) receptor (CD26) for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and prevent infection in vitro.",PMC3838260,PMC3838260_0
"The study found that MERS-CoV binds to human CD26, which is also recognized by the antibiotic cycloserine, and that this interaction is essential for viral entry into cells.",PMC3838260,PMC3838260_1
"The study revealed that MERS-CoV binding to CD26 is mediated by the DPP4 domain, and that the antibodies 2F9 and 1F7 block viral entry into cells by inhibiting MERS-CoV binding to CD26.",PMC3838260,PMC3838260_2
"The study showed that the anti-CD26 mabs 2F9 and 1F7, as well as a humanized mab, YS110, which recognizes an epitope similar to that of 1F7, can inhibit MERS-CoV infection in vitro, and that YS110, which is being evaluated in a clinical trial, is a potential treatment for MERS-CoV infection.",PMC3838260,PMC3838260_3
"The study suggested that the main regions of CD26 for MERS-CoV binding are close to amino acid residues 358, which are recognized by the mab 2F9, and that regions defined by the mabs 1F7 and YS110 (which recognize between amino acid residues 248 and 358, excluding the adenosine deaminase (ADA)-binding regions) are also partially involved in MERS-CoV binding.",PMC3838260,PMC3838260_4
