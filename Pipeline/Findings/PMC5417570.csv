"The molecular epidemiology study on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) types circulating in commercial poultry over a 1-year period identified three different IBV types: ark, mass, and dmv/1639. The study found that the ark type of IBV, for which the vaccine does not provide adequate protection against homologous challenge, persists in chickens and results in a ""rolling"" vaccine reaction in the flock, where a small proportion of the flock becomes infected with the vaccine and transmits that vaccine to susceptible flock mates.",PMC5417570,PMC5417570_0
The study also found that recombination between heterologous strains of IBV occurs in the field and that the presence of experimentally reisolated ark-dpi vaccine viruses and ark-dpi vaccine-like field viruses in the predominant groups is consistent with the presence of minor subpopulations in the vaccine vials that are the most fit viruses to infect and replicate in chickens.,PMC5417570,PMC5417570_1
"The study showed that the dmv/1639 type of IBV is evolving under negative selection pressure, with an observed shift from a highly virulent virus causing lesions in the kidney that can result in significant mortality to a virus causing only mild respiratory signs and little or no mortality in the host.",PMC5417570,PMC5417570_2
"The study found that the viruses isolated were indeed grouped with attenuated vaccine viruses, indicating that they have been circulating for some time in the field and potentially explaining the clinical signs observed in the flock.",PMC5417570,PMC5417570_3
"The study showed that passage from bird to bird can serve to ""heat up"" the vaccine virus, resulting in reversion to pathogenicity, and thus potentially explaining the clinical signs of disease associated with the ark type of IBV in commercial poultry.",PMC5417570,PMC5417570_4
