"The study developed two multiplex PCR (mPCR) methods for the detection of canine respiratory viruses (crV) and enteric viruses (ceV) in dogs. These methods are efficient, sensitive, specific, and low-cost, and can be initiated by simply adding enzyme, ddh2o, premixed primers, and template.",PMC6398926,PMC6398926_0
"The methods were tested on clinical samples from 20 nasal swabs and 20 anal swabs collected from dogs with symptoms of respiratory disease or enteric disease. The ratio of positive samples to total samples was 80% (16/20) for crV detection and 85% (17/20) for cEV detection, indicating good sensitivity and specificity.",PMC6398926,PMC6398926_1
"The study found that canine infectious diseases mainly include respiratory and intestinal viral diseases, including crV (cav-2, cdv, civ, and cpv) and cEV (cav-2, caninecv, ccov, and cpv).",PMC6398926,PMC6398926_2
"The study suggests that other pathogenic bacteria are often present along with viruses in canine infections and should also be monitored in future. For example, canine reovirus, bordetella bronchiseptica, and pseudorabies virus are pathogens causing serious zoonotic diseases that should be included in future mPCR detection methods.",PMC6398926,PMC6398926_3
"The study also found that the live vaccine strains used may have an unavoidable impact on disease detection using the methods developed in this study, and discriminating between wild-type infections and vaccines is important. Therefore, future research should aim to develop broad-spectrum and accurate mPCR detection methods that can differentiate between wild-type infections and vaccines.",PMC6398926,PMC6398926_4
