"The spectrin tetramerization domain, a folded three-helix bundle, undergoes a reversible two-state folding-unfolding process with a calculated m-value of 0.82 ± 0.04 kcal mol−1 m−1, indicating some loss of helical character upon dissociation.",PMC3512043,PMC3512043_0
"The spectrin tetramerization domain undergoes a reversible two-state folding-unfolding process with a calculated ΔG° value of -26.7 ± 1.3 kcal mol−1 at 23°C, and the same equation used for association is used here to describe the dissociation of preformed spectrin complex, induced by dilution into denaturant, providing estimates of the dissociation rate constant and its linear response to denaturant that were consistent with those estimated from the association reaction, in good support of a two-state reversible model for the interaction.",PMC3512043,PMC3512043_1
"The spectrin tetramerization domain undergoes a reversible two-state folding-unfolding process, and unfolding of similar homo- and heterodimeric complexes is often fit to single-exponential decay functions appropriate for effectively irreversible systems, but this method can overestimate the dissociation rate constant, and detailed inspection of eq. 5 shows that fitting with the irreversible model will always overestimate the dissociation rate constant, to an extent that depends on the relative sizes of kd and protein concentration.",PMC3512043,PMC3512043_2
"The spectrin tetramerization domain undergoes a reversible two-state folding-unfolding process, and the association of nonerythroid spectrin results in a significantly stronger complex and faster association kinetics, while the same equation used for association was used here to describe the dissociation of preformed spectrin complex, induced by dilution into denaturant, providing estimates of the dissociation rate constant and its linear response to denaturant that were consistent with those estimated from the association experiment, in good support of a two-state reversible model for the interaction.",PMC3512043,PMC3512043_3
"The spectrin tetramerization domain undergoes a reversible two-state folding-unfolding process, and the experimental value of meq is similar to the values obtained from the unfolding of isolated spectrin domains",PMC3512043,PMC3512043_4
