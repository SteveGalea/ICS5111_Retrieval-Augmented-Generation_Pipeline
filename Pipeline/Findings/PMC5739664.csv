"In a study investigating the effect of indirubin on the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway in mice with influenza virus infection, it was found that indirubin treatment reduced the expression of IFN-inducible protein 16 (IP-16) and IFN-beta (IFN-Î²), which are key components in the IFN signaling pathway.",PMC5739664,PMC5739664_0
"Another study found that indirubin treatment reduced the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 1 (MKP1), a negative regulator of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is known to play a critical role in the development of acute lung injury (ALI) in mice with influenza virus infection.",PMC5739664,PMC5739664_1
"In a study examining the effect of indirubin on the expression of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) in mice with influenza virus infection, it was found that indirubin treatment reduced the expression of MASVS, which is an essential component in the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway, leading to the production of type I IFNs.",PMC5739664,PMC5739664_2
"In a study investigating the effect of indirubin on the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in mice with influenza virus infection, it was found that indirubin treatment reduced the expression of HIF-1, which is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of ALI.",PMC5739664,PMC5739664_3
"In a study examining the effect of indirubin on the expression of sting (STING), a key component in the RLR signaling pathway, in mice with influenza virus infection, it was found that indirubin treatment reduced the expression of STING, leading to reduced production of type I IFNs.",PMC5739664,PMC5739664_4
"In a study investigating the effect of indirubin on the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAPKK1) and MAPKK1/MAPKK3 (MAPKK3), key components in the MAPK signaling pathway, in mice with influenza virus infection, it was found that indirubin treatment reduced the expression of both MAPKK",PMC5739664,PMC5739664_5
