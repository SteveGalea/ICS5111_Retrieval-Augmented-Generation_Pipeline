"High-throughput genome sequencing technologies have enabled the rapid identification of genes essential for virulence and survival of pathogens in their host environments. For example, the proteome of a pathogen, including its immunodominant and immunorecessive antigens, can be structurally characterized to reveal mechanisms used by the virus to evade host antibody responses.",PMC2752168,PMC2752168_0
"Genome-based approaches have facilitated the identification of vaccine and drug targets, including the prediction of immune responses and the potential for autoimmunity. For example, the availability of the human genome sequence combined with methods for predicting b cell and t cell epitopes will facilitate screening for homology or similarity between target candidates and host peptides.",PMC2752168,PMC2752168_1
"The use of techniques including microarray-based analysis of virus-induced host gene expression has revealed several possible targets for drugs aimed at pathogen targets. For example, the cholesterol-lowering drugs statins have an anti-hiv effect that is believed to be mediated by preventing activation of the host protein rho, which is activated by the hiv envelope protein and required for virus entry to the cell.",PMC2752168,PMC2752168_2
"The ability to predict an individual's response to a vaccine or drug, based on genetic variability, will enable physicians to determine whether a patient is genetically susceptible to a disease, the possible adverse effects of a vaccine or drug, and the appropriate schedule or dose to use.",PMC2752168,PMC2752168_3
"The arrival of genomics has greatly aided in the identification of vaccine and drug targets and in the processes needed to bring a new vaccine or drug to the market. However, the stepwise series of prelicensure clinical trials (phase i, ii, and iii) that are required to document the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a vaccine are still highly time-consuming and costly.",PMC2752168,PMC2752168_4
