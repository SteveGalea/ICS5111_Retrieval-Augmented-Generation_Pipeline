"As of March 2015, there have been 1102 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, with a case fatality rate of 37.7%. Most cases (973) have been reported in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian Peninsula, with cases reported outside the region linked to travel to or from the area.",PMC4534810,PMC4534810_0
"MERS-CoV belongs to the C lineage of the genus Betacoronavirus, with the taphozous perforatus as a probable natural reservoir. Bat guano, saliva, and/or urine contaminate food and water resources in areas with palm orchards, potentially serving as an indirect source of transmission to camels, people, and other animals.",PMC4534810,PMC4534810_1
"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), also known as CD26, is the functional receptor for MERS-CoV. The virus can cause severe respiratory illness, particularly in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, although asymptomatic and mild cases have also been reported.",PMC4534810,PMC4534810_2
"Co-infection with other pathogens, including influenza A, parainfluenza, herpes simplex, and pneumococcus, has been reported in MERS-CoV cases.",PMC4534810,PMC4534810_3
"The annual mortality associated with MERS-CoV is lower than that of many other viruses that induce acute viral infections, such as seasonal flu, rotavirus, measles, rabies, yellow fever virus, dengue fever virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Lassa fever virus. The virus is prone to replicate efficiently in primate, pig, and goat cell cultures, but people in direct contact with camels are at the most risk of contracting MERS-CoV infection, with other possible indirect contact including the consumption of unpasteurized camel milk. MERS-CoV positive sera has been found in samples from as early as 1983 in Somalia and Sudan, indicating that the virus has been circulating for at least 31 years in the Horn of Africa countries without causing large-scale fatalities in humans.",PMC4534810,PMC4534810_4
