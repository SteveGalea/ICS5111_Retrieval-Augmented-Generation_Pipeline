"In a study investigating the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) on hamsters, it was found that hamsters are particularly susceptible to VSV infection, with as few as 10 pfu of VSV inoculated intraperitoneally resulting in uniform lethality within 72 hours. Pro-inflammatory, innate, and anti-inflammatory responses were largely upregulated in all three organs examined, with some being downregulated. Anti-apoptotic gene expression was minimally upregulated in expression in all tissues, but was increased only in the livers of infected animals. Expression of genes encoding for cell junction proteins was generally unaffected by VSV infection in liver, increased in the lungs, and reduced in the spleen of infected hamsters. Expression of fibrinogen was increased initially followed by a substantial decrease in expression in spleen and liver in final stages of the disease. The opposite was found for lung tissue. VEGF expression was strongly reduced in all tissues monitored during both early and terminal stages of infection.",PMC3085612,PMC3085612_0
"In another study, it was found that hamsters mount more robust immune responses in the liver and spleen than in the lung during VSV infection.

"In the same study, it was found that after infection with VSV (106 pfu), pro-apoptotic genes were minimally upregulated in expression in all tissues, but anti-apoptotic gene expression was increased only in the livers of infected animals.",PMC3085612,PMC3085612_2
