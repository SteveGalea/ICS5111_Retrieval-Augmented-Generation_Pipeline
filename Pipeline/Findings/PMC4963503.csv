"TB-lamp, a simple and sensitive diagnostic tool for tuberculosis (TB), demonstrated significant gains in sensitivity over smear microscopy in peripheral laboratories, with nearly all smear-positive TB cases (95% to 100%) and roughly 50% to 85% of smear-negative TB cases detected across the various settings.",PMC4963503,PMC4963503_0
"The interreader variability for TB-lamp was reported to be negligible during feasibility studies, and users generally found TB-lamp to be simpler than microscopy and preferable in settings with a standard workload, as it can reach higher throughput through the use of batched runs.",PMC4963503,PMC4963503_1
"The TB-lamp showed specificities of 95% to 100% in smear-positive TB cases and 56% to 88% in smear-negative TB cases across sites, but root cause analysis demonstrated a link between false positivity and low reaction volume, especially at high temperatures and time-sensitive steps.",PMC4963503,PMC4963503_2
The TB-lamp specificities varied across sites (94% to 98%) and were lower than those for the Xpert MTB/rif (98% to 100%).,PMC4963503,PMC4963503_3
"Further training on time-sensitive steps and the specification of a higher volume of dna eluent to reconstitute the TB-lamp reagents reduced false positives, and the repeat study in India after retraining showed an improved specificity of 96.6% overall and a specificity of 97.6% when operating temperatures were under 30Â°C as recommended by the manufacturer, which is consistent with other sites.",PMC4963503,PMC4963503_4
