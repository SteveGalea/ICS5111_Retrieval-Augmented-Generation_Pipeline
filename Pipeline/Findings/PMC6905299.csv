"In a study analyzing timeliness of notifications in the Netherlands, it was found that legal changes and raised awareness during outbreaks successfully reduced notification and reporting delays by physicians and laboratories to the Municipal Public Health Services (GGD) and reporting delays to the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). However, legal timeliness thresholds were not yet met for some diseases, such as bacterial gastrointestinal infections, and delays in disease identification and notification still need to be reduced, especially for measles and bacterial gastroenteritis. The authors recommend enhancing awareness among public and physicians during outbreaks and optimizing laboratory confirmation procedures to achieve early detection and reduce delays in the notification chain.",PMC6905299,PMC6905299_0
"In another study, it was found that notification delay, patient delay, and doctor delay differ by disease, as some diseases develop gradually, are nonspecific, or may need laboratory tests which are not available at every laboratory. During outbreaks, real-time information on new cases is needed to monitor the effect of control measures. The authors recommend including dates of doctor's consultation and laboratory test initiation in every notification to enable monitoring of causes of delay before laboratory confirmation and measuring the effect of raising awareness among public and physicians during outbreaks.",PMC6905299,PMC6905299_1
"In a third study, it was found that completeness rates for laboratory-confirmed hospitalized pertussis cases have been determined as low as 16.5-22% for cases 2 years and older and between 52-61% for children younger than 2 years. Reporting completeness during the measles outbreak in 2013-2014 has been estimated as low as 9%, mainly due to patients not seeking medical care. The authors recommend improving insight into notification completeness at both local and national levels to improve the surveillance system.",PMC6905299,PMC6905299_2
"In a fourth study, it was found that missing data on the first date of consultation (TC) or of requesting laboratory testing (TL) is not available, as this is not legally required in some European Union countries, such as Sweden, the UK, and the United States. The authors recommend including these time points in every notification to enable monitoring of causes of delay before laboratory confirmation and measuring the effect of raising awareness among public and physicians during outbreaks.",PMC6905299,PMC6905299_3
