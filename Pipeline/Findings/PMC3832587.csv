"The study found that hhvs, mainly cmv, were the most commonly detected pathogens in infants and young children with cap in a rural area of China. The prevalence of cmv among is samples of cap was significantly higher than that among is samples of non-cap control group.",PMC3832587,PMC3832587_0
"The study identified a detectable virus in more than 99.6% of case participants, in which cmv, hhv-6, ebv, rsv, and hbov were predominant and contributed significantly to the spectrum of cap in a rural area of China.",PMC3832587,PMC3832587_1
"The study found that hhvs co-infections were found in 70% of the cap cases, compared with rates between 15 and 45% in previous etiological studies of childhood cap.",PMC3832587,PMC3832587_2
"The study suggests that hhvs, especially cmv, may be associated with cap in infants and children, but further studies are required to determine the relationship of the presence of hhvs and severity of disease.",PMC3832587,PMC3832587_3
"The study highlights the importance of hhvs and respiratory viruses in children with cap and suggests that hhvs, mainly cmv, should receive greater attention in future treatment and prevention studies of cap in infants and children.",PMC3832587,PMC3832587_4
