The paper describes two methods to streamline the production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The first method uses surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with a small amount of primary hybridoma supernatant to rapidly identify the isotype and affinity of mAbs for native antigens. The second method uses flow cytometry to isolate antigen-specific hybridomas from a heterogeneous mixture grown in bulk immediately following fusion. Both methods greatly reduce the time and effort required to go from the initial fusion to the isolation of hybridoma clones producing mAbs of the appropriate specificity and functions for downstream applications.,PMC4552657,PMC4552657_0
The paper demonstrates that fluorescently labelled antigens can be used to single-cell sort antigen-specific hybridoma cells from a fusion bulk mixture directly. This method can be used to identify either rare cells in hybridoma cultures that have switched to useful genetically downstream isotypes or rare antigen-specific hybridomas in a heterogeneous mixture of hybridoma cells grown in bulk immediately following fusion.,PMC4552657,PMC4552657_1
"The paper shows that hybridoma cell surface expression of mAbs allows for the isolation of antigen-specific hybridomas in a heterogeneous mixture grown in bulk immediately following fusion. This method can be used to identify mAbs suitable for research, commercial, and therapeutic uses.",PMC4552657,PMC4552657_2
"The paper demonstrates that the surface form of igg receptor on hybridoma cells lacks the signaling igÎ± co-receptor. This finding may be of some advantage in the uses proposed in the paper involving engagement of the surface igg by antibody or antigen in order to isolate the cell, as the lack of signaling through the engaged receptor may head off activation untoward downstream signaling pathway that could induce apoptosis.",PMC4552657,PMC4552657_3
"The paper describes a method for optimizing the production and characterization of mAbs, especially those specific for epitopes present on native proteins. The method allows for the rapid identification of mAbs suitable for research, commercial, and therapeutic uses. The paper also describes a method for isolating antigen-specific hybridomas from a heterogeneous mixture grown in bulk immediately following fusion, using flow cytometry to take advantage of the strong correlation between hybridoma secreted and surface igg. This method can be used to find appropriate mAbs for research, commercial, and therapeut",PMC4552657,PMC4552657_4
