"The complete genome sequence of avnv, a newly isolated herpesvirus from Chinese farmed scallops, has been determined.",PMC3623871,PMC3623871_0
"The avnv genome is highly related, but not identical, to that of ostreid herpesvirus 1 (oshv-1), a previously identified herpesvirus affecting oysters and scallops.",PMC3623871,PMC3623871_1
"The avnv genome contains a large number of variations, including deletions, insertions, and substitutions, in both coding and non-coding regions.",PMC3623871,PMC3623871_2
"The avnv genome presents a high level of similarity, but not identity, to that of oshv-1, as observed in both coding and non-coding regions.",PMC3623871,PMC3623871_3
"The avnv genome contains a large insertion of 2.6 kb, which is not present in the oshv-1 genome.",PMC3623871,PMC3623871_4
