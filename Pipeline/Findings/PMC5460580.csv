"The study describes the development of diagnostic assays for two newly discovered viruses, Malsoor virus and Bat Adenovirus, in bats.",PMC5460580,PMC5460580_0
"The researchers designed and optimized specific diagnostic assays for both viruses, including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), nested PCR, and real-time RT-PCR.",PMC5460580,PMC5460580_1
"The assays were standardized using viral isolates, and their sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using in vitro-transcribed viral RNA and DNA.",PMC5460580,PMC5460580_2
"The researchers found that real-time RT-PCR was more sensitive than nested PCR for Malsoor virus, while nested PCR was more sensitive than real-time RT-PCR for Bat Adenovirus.",PMC5460580,PMC5460580_3
The assays were able to successfully detect both viruses in field-collected bat samples.,PMC5460580,PMC5460580_4
The findings contribute to the understanding of the prevalence and distribution of these newly discovered viruses in bats.,PMC5460580,PMC5460580_5
