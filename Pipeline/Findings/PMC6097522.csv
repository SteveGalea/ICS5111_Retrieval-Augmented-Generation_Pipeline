"In a study investigating the potential for a universal vaccine against lasv, it was found that the genetic variability between lasv strains is considerable, with at least five clades identified. The current nigerian outbreak strain of lasv is thought to be a clade iii isolate, but has yet to be tested for efficacy against the vsv-lasv-gpc vaccine.",PMC6097522,PMC6097522_0
"A recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) vaccine platform was developed to prevent lasv infection. The vsv-lasv-gpc vaccine was found to be apathogenic in mice, and cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with vsv-lasv-gpc survived a lethal dose of lasv josiah with no overt signs of disease or changes in blood chemistry or hematology.",PMC6097522,PMC6097522_1
"A follow-up study in cynomolgus macaques found that the vsv-lasv-gpc vaccine protected animals from both lasv and ebov infection, suggesting that the vsv vector has the potential to be used repeatedly for the protection of both ebov and lasv infection in africa.",PMC6097522,PMC6097522_2
"In a study investigating the potential for a universal vaccine against lasv, it was found that the genetic makeup of the virus underwent a significant change allowing it to spread more readily or become more pathogenic.",PMC6097522,PMC6097522_3
The vsv-lasv-gpc vaccine was found to be among one of the leading candidates developed thus far and should be targeted for accelerated development by CEPi and its collaborating partners. The vsv recombinant system was found to be extremely robust and has the potential to express and tolerate the expression of multiple transgenes. The combination of both ebov and lasv glycoprotein expression in a single vaccine was found to be feasible and has significant potential to prevent future outbreaks of ebov and lasv in West Africa.,PMC6097522,PMC6097522_4
