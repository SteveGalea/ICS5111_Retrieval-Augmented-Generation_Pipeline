"Pretreatment and postinfection treatment with interferon gamma (IFN-γ) provide direct antiviral effects on sinoveniren (SV) infection in mature neurons, inhibiting viral replication and promoting survival.",PMC1082728,PMC1082728_0
"In sinveniren-infected neurons, between 3 and 6 hours after IFN-γ treatment, there is a general increase in cellular protein synthesis, viral protein synthesis, and viral RNA transcription. This period of improved cellular function is followed by a gradual elimination of viral protein and RNA synthesis.",PMC1082728,PMC1082728_1
"The ratio of genomic to subgenomic RNA synthesis decreases in SV-infected neurons after IFN-γ treatment, indicating a decrease in production of nonstructural proteins, which may limit synthesis of new minus-strand RNAs because the p123 polyprotein, plus nsp4, is required for minus-strand synthesis.",PMC1082728,PMC1082728_2
"Pretreatment and postinfection treatment with IFN-γ result in a noncytolytic clearance of established SV infection in mature neurons, which involves multiple mechanisms converging to inhibit virus replication and requires de novo cellular protein synthesis.",PMC1082728,PMC1082728_3
"In mature neurons, IFN-γ treatment improves cellular function and inhibits viral replication, suggesting that mature neurons can activate pathways that result in noncytolytic clearance of virus infection. However, the downstream signaling events and effector molecules responsible for inhibiting SV and other viruses in neurons are not fully understood.",PMC1082728,PMC1082728_4
