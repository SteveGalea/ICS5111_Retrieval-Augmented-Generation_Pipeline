"Ribosomal frameshifting, though generally less frequent than transcriptional slippage, occurs in various contexts and can contribute to the synthesis of ubb+1, app+1, and proteins in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's and spinocerebellar ataxias.",PMC1484430,PMC1484430_0
Frameshifting in the context of ubb+1 and app+1 involves dissociation and re-pairing of anticodons in the âˆ’1 frame and can be enhanced by certain mRNA structural elements.,PMC1484430,PMC1484430_1
"In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, frameshifting can result in the production of proteins containing expanded polyglutamine or polyalanine tracts, which have been implicated in disease progression.",PMC1484430,PMC1484430_2
"Antibiotics such as aminoglycosides can affect frameshifting in humans, with complex effects that may exacerbate or delay onset of neurodegenerative diseases.",PMC1484430,PMC1484430_3
"Certain antibiotics, such as sparsomycin and anisomycin, can affect frameshifting by targeting various regions of the ribosome, while others, such as gentamycin, can reduce or increase frameshifting levels at specific sites.",PMC1484430,PMC1484430_4
