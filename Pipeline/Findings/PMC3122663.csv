"The LAM-PCR assay, a new diagnostic technique, has been found to be more sensitive than nested PCR in detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. Tuberculosis) infection in low-copy-number cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, with a sensitivity of 88.23% in culture-negative cases, as reported in this study.",PMC3122663,PMC3122663_0
"The LAM-PCR assay, which can provide clinical confirmation in culture-positive cases, is also useful in clinical confirmation in culture-negative cases where the bacterial load is low.",PMC3122663,PMC3122663_1
"The study found that the LAM-PCR assay can be beneficial for detecting M. Tuberculosis infection in clinically suspicious cases when small mycobacterial loads are present, as it takes only 60 minutes, compared to 3 to 4 hours for other molecular tests, making it beneficial for tertiary healthcare centers that require quick results.",PMC3122663,PMC3122663_2
"The study suggests that the threshold limit for interpreting results in LAM-PCR assay should vary according to the biological fluid analyzed and the microbial load it harbors, as it may be necessary to have a lower threshold limit for CSF and a higher threshold limit for sputum samples for the same infection, such as tuberculosis, for the assays to be clinically meaningful.",PMC3122663,PMC3122663_3
"The study highlights the importance of designing appropriate primers targeting high-copy-number genes, such as IS6110, to improve the sensitivity of the LAM-PCR assay, as demonstrated by the authors' work on serial dilutions by spiking a control CSF sample with known concentrations of M. Tuberculosis.",PMC3122663,PMC3122663_4
