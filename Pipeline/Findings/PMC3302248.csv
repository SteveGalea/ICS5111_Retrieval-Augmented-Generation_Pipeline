"Coronavirus spike proteins, which mediate viral entry into host cells, can have different tertiary structures due to evolutionary pressure to maintain function within a certain structural framework.",PMC3302248,PMC3302248_0
"Although sequences and receptor usage of s1 subunits from different coronavirus genera are divergent, they share related structural topologies.",PMC3302248,PMC3302248_1
"Sars-cov and nl63-cov c-domains, which bind to the same receptor, have different primary, secondary, and tertiary structures but share related structural topologies due to extensive divergent evolution.",PMC3302248,PMC3302248_2
"Sars-cov and nl63-cov c-domains bind to their common receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), using different molecular mechanisms, with ace2 being the outcome of convergent evolution.",PMC3302248,PMC3302248_3
"The alpha-cov and gamma-cov ntds are likely to share similar structural topologies with the beta-cov mhv ntd, which has originated from a host galectin and later evolved a carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (ceacam1)-binding function.",PMC3302248,PMC3302248_4
