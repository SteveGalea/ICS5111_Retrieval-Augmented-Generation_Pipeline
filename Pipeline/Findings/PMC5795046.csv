A novel inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea (PEDV) vaccine formulated with an oil-based W/O/W emulsion adjuvant was found to be immunogenic and effective in growing pigs.,PMC5795046,PMC5795046_0
Pigs that received the vaccine containing the oil-based W/O/W emulsion adjuvant had the strongest antibody responses against PEDV.,PMC5795046,PMC5795046_1
The experimental vaccine containing the oil-based W/O/W emulsion adjuvant protected against both disease progression and viral shedding.,PMC5795046,PMC5795046_2
"Pigs that received vaccines containing ims1313 and imsGel, both of which are aqueous adjuvants, exhibited a strong serum PEDV-specific antibody response.",PMC5795046,PMC5795046_3
"A virulent Korean PEDV strain, Qiap1401, was recently isolated and passaged in vero cells at 3-day intervals, and a growth kinetics analysis showed that the infectious titer of Qiap1401-p70 increased significantly to 107.0 TCID50/mL after 70 passages, indicating that the virus had acquired adaptive mutations that enhanced production of infectious virus.",PMC5795046,PMC5795046_4
