"The study found that the hiv-1 RNA frameshift hairpin structure has a higher level of conformational heterogeneity during refolding compared to pseudoknot-induced frameshift structures. This heterogeneity is reflected in a wider distribution of unfolding forces and contour length changes, suggesting that the hiv-1 frameshift hairpin undergoes more alternate structures when refolding compared to pseudoknot-induced frameshift structures.",PMC5558907,PMC5558907_0
"The study also found that the hiv-1 frameshift hairpin has a higher energy barrier, with a calculated free energy change of 23 ± 1 kbt, compared to the upper stem only, which has a calculated free energy change of 25 ± 1 kbt.",PMC5558907,PMC5558907_1
"The study found that the hiv-1 frameshift hairpin structure exhibits a higher level of structural fluctuations during refolding compared to pseudoknot-induced frameshift structures, as evidenced by a wider distribution of unfolding forces and contour length changes.",PMC5558907,PMC5558907_2
The study noted that the hiv-1 frameshift hairpin structure has a similar level of conformational heterogeneity during refolding to hairpin-based stimulatory structures in an alphavirus.,PMC5558907,PMC5558907_3
"The study found that the hiv-1 frameshift hairpin structure has a contour length change of 17 ± 1 nm when refolding, which is similar to the contour length change expected from pseudoknots of similar size.",PMC5558907,PMC5558907_4
