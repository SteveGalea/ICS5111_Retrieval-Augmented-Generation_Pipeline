The study found that the house finch strain isolated from a wild bird in Georgia in 1995 (hf1995) was less infectious and less virulent than the poultry strain (rlow) in experimental infections. The study also found that hf1995-inoculated birds had lower peak bacterial loads and cleared the infection earlier than rlow-inoculated birds.,PMC5820954,PMC5820954_0
"The study found that birds infected with hf1995 had lower concentrations of anti-m. Gallisepticum antibodies in plasma at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post-infection compared to birds infected with rlow.",PMC5820954,PMC5820954_1
The study found that birds infected with hf1995 had less severe clinical signs of conjunctivitis than birds infected with rlow.,PMC5820954,PMC5820954_2
The study found that the ability of hf1995 to establish an infection and the ability of hf1995-inoculated birds to clear the infection were similar to those of rlow-inoculated birds.,PMC5820954,PMC5820954_3
"The study found that the ability of hf1995-inoculated birds to clear clinical signs of conjunctivitis was similar to that of rlow-inoculated birds. However, the study also found that the severity of conjunctivitis in symptomatic hf1995-inoculated birds was lower than that in symptomatic rlow-inoculated birds.",PMC5820954,PMC5820954_4
