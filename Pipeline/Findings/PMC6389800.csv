The study describes the production of diagnostic antibodies against Salmonella typhimurium using transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana plants.,PMC6389800,PMC6389800_0
"The study reports the development of a transient expression system for diagnostic antibodies, which utilizes a silencing suppressor protein called γb from the barley stripe mosaic virus (Hordeum vulgare) to enhance recombinant protein expression levels.",PMC6389800,PMC6389800_1
"The study demonstrates the feasibility of using Nicotiana benthamiana production as an expression platform for diagnostic Salmonella typhimurium antibodies, as the recombinant proteins produced in plants were biologically active, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests.",PMC6389800,PMC6389800_2
"The study shows that the accumulation of recombinant proteins expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves was enhanced by exploring the pslv γb silencing suppressor, demonstrating its applicability for biotechnological purposes.",PMC6389800,PMC6389800_3
"The study reveals that the highest accumulation level for diagnostic Salmonella typhimurium antibodies was observed at 5-7 days after agroinfiltration, and that the functional equivalence between plant- and mammalian cells-made recombinant proteins was observed for the plant-derived diagnostic antibodies.",PMC6389800,PMC6389800_4
