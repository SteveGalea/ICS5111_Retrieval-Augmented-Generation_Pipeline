"The study identified two distinct inbred lines of chicken, lines C-B12 and 0, that have a natural resistance to avian influenza virus.",PMC4899695,PMC4899695_0
Infection of chicken embryo fibroblasts with the avian influenza virus strain A/turkey/England/647/77 (H7N7) in the presence or absence of specific antibodies resulted in the production of antigen-specific B cells.,PMC4899695,PMC4899695_1
"The study found that the number of antigen-specific B cells was significantly higher in the presence of antibodies against the HA and NA proteins of the avian influenza virus, indicating a role for antibodies in the induction of antigen-specific B cells.",PMC4899695,PMC4899695_2
"Infection of chicken embryo fibroblasts with the avian influenza virus strain A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL-02/2008 (H9N2) resulted in the production of interferon gamma (IFN-Î³), a cytokine involved in host defense against viral infection.",PMC4899695,PMC4899695_3
"The study identified a significant difference in the susceptibility to avian influenza virus infection and transmission dynamics between the inbred lines C-B12 and 0, with line C-B12 showing greater resistance.",PMC4899695,PMC4899695_4
