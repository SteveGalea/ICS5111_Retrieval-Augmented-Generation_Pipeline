The study found that the molecular chaperone hsp110 significantly enhances the immunogenicity of the HLA-A*0201-restricted HPV16 E711-20 epitope vaccine in a mouse model.,PMC3697441,PMC3697441_0
"The mHSP110-E711-20 complex elicited strong antigen-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation, interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) secretion, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against the E711-20 epitope.",PMC3697441,PMC3697441_1
"The study showed that the mHSP110-E711-20 complex immunization reduced tumor volume and enhanced survival of tumor-bearing mice, with higher antitumor effects than the cfa-E711-20 peptide.",PMC3697441,PMC3697441_2
"The mHSP110-E711-20 complex showed higher antitumor immune response than the mHSP70-E711-20 complex in priming the host antitumor response, possibly due to the fact that hsp110 has a much higher protein- and peptide-binding affinity than hsp70.",PMC3697441,PMC3697441_3
"The study encourages further investigations of hsp110 as a promising candidate immunomodulator for peptide-based human cancer vaccines, such as the HLA-A2-restricted E711-20 epitope.",PMC3697441,PMC3697441_4
