"The study developed an antibody-mediated delivery system for the delivery of siRNA into ha-positive cells infected with H5N1 virus, using husCFv as a targeting ligand. The system consisted of immunoliposomes entrapped with siRNA against the influenza virus nucleoprotein, with approximately 20 husCFv molecules per liposome.",PMC3993214,PMC3993214_0
"The study demonstrated the successful use of husCFv in antibody-mediated delivery and an improved potency of siRNA delivery in an in vitro H5N1 infection model, using MDCK cells.",PMC3993214,PMC3993214_1
"The study showed that the siRNA-mediated inhibition of H5N1 replication was enhanced by the targeted delivery using husCFv-mediated cell targeting, but not necessarily by the antibody-neutralizing activity of husCFv itself.",PMC3993214,PMC3993214_2
"The study indicated that the husCFv-mediated cell targeting could potentially be valuable for both prophylactic as well as therapeutic treatments against H5N1 infection, as long as the targeting antibodies bind to the ha protein, the conserved epitope of the antigenically diverse H5N1 strains, to achieve therapeutic value for controlling infections from current and future H5N1 variants.",PMC3993214,PMC3993214_3
"The study showed that the siRNA efficacy in inhibiting H5N1 replication was still present when applied after viral infection, resulting in a 10-fold reduction in the viral titer compared with the titer with nontargeted liposomes.",PMC3993214,PMC3993214_4
