"In a study evaluating the pathogenesis of four different strains of swine-origin H1N1 influenza viruses in cynomolgus macaques, the severity of radiographic lesions ranged from mild in macaques infected with the circulating A/Kawasaki/Utah4/2009 virus to severe in those infected with the A/Mexico/Indre4487/2009 and A/California/4/2009 viruses.",PMC2958208,PMC2958208_0
"The study found that interstitial infiltration was present in 16% of macaques infected with the circulating A/Kawasaki/Utah4/2009 virus, 67% in each group of macaques infected with the A/Mexico/Indre4487/2009 and A/Swine/Mexico4108/2009 viruses, and 89% in macaques infected with the A/California/4/2009 virus.",PMC2958208,PMC2958208_1
"The study also demonstrated that macaques infected with the A/California/4/2009 virus had the highest average radiographic score at all time points, with the onset of radiographic changes occurring on day 1 and peak severity on day 8 after infection, followed by a trend of decreasing radiographic scores to day 14 after infection.",PMC2958208,PMC2958208_2
"The study found that both the A/Mexico/Indre4487/2009 and A/Swine/Mexico4108/2009 viruses led to detectable radiographic changes on day 1 after infection, with similar patterns of radiographic changes, and differences between the two viruses were not statistically significant.",PMC2958208,PMC2958208_3
"The study showed that time-course thoracic radiographs have scientific value as a noninvasive refinement methodology for evaluating the pathogenesis of emerging respiratory pathogens, as they allowed for the characterization of the onset of disease, peak severity, and partial to complete resolution of radiographic changes, as well as correlations to clinical presentations.",PMC2958208,PMC2958208_4
