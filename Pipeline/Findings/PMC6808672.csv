"Among 469 hct recipients, 21 distinct bov RTIs were observed, without apparent seasonality, with higher frequency in the latter half of the first 100 days post-hct.",PMC6808672,PMC6808672_0
Watery eyes were more frequently observed in patients with bov RTIs compared to those without any virus detected.,PMC6808672,PMC6808672_1
"Univariable models among patients with bov RTIs post-hct showed higher peak viral loads in nasal samples and the presence of respiratory copathogens were associated with respiratory symptoms, but bov detection in plasma was not.",PMC6808672,PMC6808672_2
Bov was more frequently detected in the latter half of the first 100 days post-hct.,PMC6808672,PMC6808672_3
"Six allogeneic hct recipients had bov detected in lower respiratory tract specimens, with four having significant respiratory copathogens or concomitant conditions contributing to respiratory compromise. No deaths were attributed mainly to bov lower RTIs.",PMC6808672,PMC6808672_4
