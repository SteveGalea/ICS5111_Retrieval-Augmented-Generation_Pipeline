"The complete genome sequence of the North American strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), designated strain vr-2332, has been determined. The genome sequence is 15,142 nucleotides in length and contains ten open reading frames (ORFs) that encode proteins.",PMC103831,PMC103831_0
The leader-body junction sites utilized by PRRSV strain vr-2332 for ORFs 2 to 7 are highly heterogeneous when compared to those of the European strain PRRSV (Lv). Strain-specific selection of leader-body junction sites and their placement in ORFs 2 to 7 delineate a clear biochemical difference between vr-2332 and Lv.,PMC103831,PMC103831_1
"The North American strain vr-2332 and the European strain Lv both contain three potential leader-body junction motifs in the region preceding ORF 7. Vr-2332 utilizes the site 123 bases upstream of the initiating ORF 7 aug for the majority of MRNA 7 transcripts and the site 9 bases upstream for a minor fraction of them. Lv, in contrast, utilizes only the site 9 bases upstream of ORF 7 for its MRNA 7 transcripts.",PMC103831,PMC103831_2
The complete genome sequence of the North American strain vr-2332 provides a framework for the design and evaluation of novel strategies for the prevention and control of PRRSV.,PMC103831,PMC103831_3
"The North American strain vr-2332 possesses genomic sequences containing three similar leader-body junction motifs in the region preceding ORF 7. Neither strain of PRRSV appears to utilize the third potential junction site, even though that putative junction site was completely conserved in both strains. No obvious consensus sequence or RNA structure surrounds the chosen leader-body junction motifs that are used.",PMC103831,PMC103831_4
