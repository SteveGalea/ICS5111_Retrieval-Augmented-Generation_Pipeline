"In a study investigating the evolution of 19 viruses from diverse eukaryotic hosts, the authors utilized a normalized phylogenetic tree topological distance, implemented in the program nelsi v0.1, to quantitatively measure the extent of virus-host co-divergence. The authors calculated the normalized phylogenetic tree topological distance, referred to as the 'nph85' distance, by comparing the tree topologies for viruses and their corresponding hosts. The nph85 distance, which utilizes two phylogenetic trees as its input, describes the number of bipartitions (clades) that are not shared between two tree topologies. The authors also reconciled the co-phylogenetic relationship between viruses and their hosts to address phylogenetic uncertainty, using the jane co-phylogenetic software package, which uses a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to find optimal solutions to reconcile co-phylogenies.",PMC5319820,PMC5319820_0
"In the same study, the authors utilized the 'untangle' function, which rotates the branches of one tree, to minimize the number of crosses lines between trees connecting the host (left) with its virus (right). If viruses and hosts have congruent topologies, then the number of crossed lines, and hence cross-species transmission events, will be reduced.",PMC5319820,PMC5319820_1
"The authors also examined the evolution of the hepadnaviridae in more detail as this family contains the best evidence for co-divergence. They reconciled the co-phylogenetic relationship between viruses and their hosts to address phylogenetic uncertainty, using the jane co-phylogenetic software package, which uses a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to find optimal solutions to reconcile co-phylogenies.",PMC5319820,PMC5319820_2
The authors excluded certain virus and host genetic sequence data either due to lack of available data or because they were unable to obtain a reliable alignment of sufficient length for phylogenetic analysis. The authors provided a summary of the virus and host diversity included and excluded in this study in a table.,PMC5319820,PMC5319820_3
