"The study, which included over 2,000 patients from three different countries in Southeast Asia, provides an overview of the viral and atypical bacterial causes of acute respiratory infections in the region.",PMC4605413,PMC4605413_0
"The study found that viruses, particularly rhinoviruses, are much more common causes of acute respiratory infections than bacterial causes, but that the viral aetiology may vary in space and time.",PMC4605413,PMC4605413_1
"The study also found that infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common atypical bacterium associated with acute respiratory infections, was associated with longer hospital stays and increased disease severity.",PMC4605413,PMC4605413_2
"The study highlighted the importance of establishing the burden and attributable fraction of acute respiratory infections caused by different pathogens, in order to improve management and prevention, and to guide antiviral treatment and reduce the inappropriate use of antimicrobials to limit the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.",PMC4605413,PMC4605413_3
"The study also emphasised the need for further research into the epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in Southeast Asia, given the increasing importance of respiratory viral infections in humans and animals, and the risks posed by such infections in light of the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and avian influenza viruses A(H5N1) and A(H7N9).",PMC4605413,PMC4605413_4
