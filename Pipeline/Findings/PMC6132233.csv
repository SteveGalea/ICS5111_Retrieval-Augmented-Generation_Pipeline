"The study found that dengue fever has a unique transmission pattern in Taiwan, with the majority of annual cases occurring in the fall, followed by the summer and winter seasons.",PMC6132233,PMC6132233_0
"The study estimated that dengue fever causes the highest health burden in the fall, with overheated summer and cool winter temperatures contributing to relatively lower disease activity.",PMC6132233,PMC6132233_1
"The study found that repellent spray alone by hosts is the most effective control strategy against dengue vectors, with an estimated control effectiveness of 71%.",PMC6132233,PMC6132233_2
The study highlighted the importance of understanding the length of use and specific mosquito species to develop repellent spray formulations in controlling dengue vectors.,PMC6132233,PMC6132233_3
"The study provided a useful tool to measure dengue health burden risk and quantify the effect of dengue control on a. aegypti infection prevalence and disease incidence in the southern region of Taiwan, which is useful to provide a reference to understand temperature-associated dengue prevalence and to identify priority interventions for high dengue burden regions.",PMC6132233,PMC6132233_4
