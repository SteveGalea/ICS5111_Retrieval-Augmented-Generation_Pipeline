"The study demonstrates that the B19 virus, a causative agent of infectious coryzaemic myocarditis, induces the activation and dimerization of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in human endothelial cells.",PMC2519586,PMC2519586_0
"The study shows that the STAT3 dimers are translocated into the nucleus where they bind to specific recognition sites of a cis-acting element (cis-element, cie) of STAT3 target genes.",PMC2519586,PMC2519586_1
"The study reveals that the B19 virus-induced STAT3 activation is followed by the activation and phosphorylation of STAT3 at serine 727, leading to maximal transcriptional activation of STAT3 target genes.",PMC2519586,PMC2519586_2
"The study indicates that the B19 virus-induced STAT3 activation is accompanied by the modulation of STAT target gene expression, including the upregulation of genes involved in immune response against viral infections and the downregulation of genes involved with virus defense.",PMC2519586,PMC2519586_3
"The study suggests that the B19 virus-induced STAT3 activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of B19-associated infectious coryzaemic myocarditis through heightened expression of inflammatory cytokines, potentially leading to endothelial cell barrier dysfunction.",PMC2519586,PMC2519586_4
