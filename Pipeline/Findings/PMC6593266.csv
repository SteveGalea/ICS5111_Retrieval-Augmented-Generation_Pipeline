This study found that neither metronidazole nor probiotics significantly improved the time to resolution of acute diarrhea in dogs compared to placebo.,PMC6593266,PMC6593266_0
"The study identified that dogs with a previous history of diarrhea, dietary indiscretion, or fluid administration had a longer time to resolution of diarrhea compared to dogs without these factors.",PMC6593266,PMC6593266_1
"The study found that 33% of fecal samples tested positive for the netf encoding gene for clostridium perfringens, which is largely consistent with previous reports but higher than expected.",PMC6593266,PMC6593266_2
"The study revealed that the time to resolution of diarrhea in dogs administered a probiotic was similar to another probiotic study with more severe hemorrhagic diarrhea, but this may be partially due to a longer duration of clinical signs before enrollment and differences in etiology and time of presentation.",PMC6593266,PMC6593266_3
"The study demonstrated that the degraded probiotic product should likely not be considered equivalent to placebo due to the lack of normal preservation techniques used in the commercial version of this product, which was likely due to the inadvertent lack of normal preservation techniques used in the commercial version of this product.",PMC6593266,PMC6593266_4
