"The study found that the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) ace2 receptor is a suitable host receptor for the wiv1-cov virus, as it was able to bind and mediate entry and infection in cells transfected with the bat ace2 gene.",PMC6316779,PMC6316779_0
"Ace2 expression was identified in multiple organs, including the nasal turbinates, apical olfactory epithelium, serous submucosal glands, pars nervosa of the pituitary gland, and lung tissue, suggesting necessary receptor expression to produce infection in Egyptian fruit bats.",PMC6316779,PMC6316779_1
"The study found limited evidence of virus replication and seroconversion in Egyptian fruit bats following inoculation with wiv1-cov, suggesting that the ability to infect and replicate efficiently is bat species-specific.",PMC6316779,PMC6316779_2
"The study observed some low-level virus replication in two out of twelve bats, resulting in an adaptive immune response, as indicated by the presence of sars-cov-specific antibodies.",PMC6316779,PMC6316779_3
"The study did not detect an increase in the presence of sars-cov-specific antibodies in most of the bats, but some low-level virus replication might have occurred in these bats, resulting in an adaptive immune response.",PMC6316779,PMC6316779_4
