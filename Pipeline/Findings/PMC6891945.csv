"This study provides the first evidence of zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV in humans in North or West Africa, specifically in Morocco, as previously reported in Kenya [14].",PMC6891945,PMC6891945_0
"The study found evidence of human infection with MERS-CoV, with two slaughterhouse workers and one person from the general population group having confirmed MERS-CoV pseudotype virus neutralising antibody, although none had a history of severe pneumonia, which is a common feature of severe MERS.",PMC6891945,PMC6891945_1
"The study suggests that camel products, such as camel milk and urine, may contribute to the transmission of MERS-CoV, as previously raised [18], although the role of camel products in MERS-CoV transmission remains unclear.",PMC6891945,PMC6891945_2
"The study found that MERS-CoV infection may range from being asymptomatic to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death, and that some mild or asymptomatic infections may have low or undetectable antibody titres to MERS-CoV, as has been previously suggested [20].",PMC6891945,PMC6891945_3
The study suggests that supplementing serology with MERS-CoV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses may identify additional individuals who have prior MERS-CoV infection in population-based studies [20].,PMC6891945,PMC6891945_4
