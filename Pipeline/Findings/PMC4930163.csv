"The study found that the basic reproductive number (r0), which is the average number of new infections generated by a single infected individual in a susceptible population, is lower in the study population than previously reported results for influenza A virus.",PMC4930163,PMC4930163_0
"The study observed that a higher fraction of dead cells at the end of infection is associated with longer infection durations and greater symptom scores auc, as indicated by the model.",PMC4930163,PMC4930163_1
"The study found that treatments acting on the infection rate or viral production rate are most effective when given before the time of peak viral load, as the model predicts.",PMC4930163,PMC4930163_2
"The study suggests that treatments acting on the virus clearance rate are more effective after the peak viral load, as the model predicts, especially when given before the time of peak viral load.",PMC4930163,PMC4930163_3
"The study recommends taking at least two to three measurements per day, if possible, for fitting mechanistic models of acute viral infections to data, as the measurement error and sensitivity of assays can significantly impact estimates of infection-related quantities.",PMC4930163,PMC4930163_4
