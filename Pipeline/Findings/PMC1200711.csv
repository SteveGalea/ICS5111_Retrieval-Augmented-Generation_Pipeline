"Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, has a long history of causing social and economic devastation, with an estimated 200 cases annually reported worldwide.",PMC1200711,PMC1200711_0
"Plague is essentially a disease of wild rodents that is transmitted by fleas, and control of this wild animal population is inherently difficult, as the burrows are often located in inaccessible areas.",PMC1200711,PMC1200711_1
"Plague is not a major health concern at present, but it persists due to its epidemiology, as the infected animal reservoir could be completely destroyed, but this would not guarantee the extinction of the disease, as Y. Pestis can survive in animal carcasses and litter for several years, thus being a source of reinfection of other rodents.",PMC1200711,PMC1200711_2
"Concerns have been raised about the possibility of bioengineered organisms resistant to standard antibiotics used for treatment and prophylaxis, as multidrug-resistant plague bacilli have recently occurred naturally.",PMC1200711,PMC1200711_3
"The recent emergence of variant strains and the possibility of resistance to current treatment regimens should lead to continuous research on Y. Pestis and identification of possible new treatment modalities, as the medical community as well as the public should be educated about the basic infectious disease epidemiology and control measures to increase the possibility of a calm and reasoned response if an outbreak should occur.",PMC1200711,PMC1200711_4
