"Expanded scope of the International Health Regulations (IHR): The IHR (2005) replaces the previous disease-specific framework with a more flexible approach that covers all events that might constitute a public health emergency of international concern, taking into account the context in which the event occurs. This approach is applicable to existing threats as well as to new and unforeseen events. The IHR (2005) recognizes the existence of threats to public health that are not related to infectious diseases and acknowledges that public health risks and emergencies are not restricted to countries with strong public health infrastructures.",PMC2851539,PMC2851539_0
"National core surveillance and response capacities: The IHR (2005) imposes significant responsibilities on countries to enhance public health capacity and infrastructure. Success will depend on the capacity and performance of national public health systems, with weak national public health capabilities undermining efforts to strengthen global public health security. National public health institutes (nphis) play a critical role in implementing the IHR (2005), as they provide leadership and coordination for public health services, ensuring detection, investigation, and response to public health emergencies. Many countries have nphis, and some have weak or nonexistent capacities, which will be challenged by the IHR (2005) requirements. The International Association of National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI) aims to strengthen and proliferate nphis globally through collaboration, technical assistance, and linkages.",PMC2851539,PMC2851539_1
"Critical role of nphis: The IANPHI aims to strengthen and proliferate nphis globally through collaboration, technical assistance, and linkages. Since 2006, IANPHI has expanded to nearly 50 current members and has an ambitious agenda for collaboration, service, and growth. IANPHI provides tools and a context for shared information, experience, and expertise through advocacy, technical assistance, and linkages. IANPHI is committed to a vision of a robust and fully integrated global network of nphis equipped to address critical public health challenges. Its mission is to strengthen and reinvigorate existing nphis, create new nphis where none exist, and provide funded grants to support nphi capacity development priorities. IANPHI achieves its service mission through advocacy, technical assistance, and linkages. IANPHI",PMC2851539,PMC2851539_2
