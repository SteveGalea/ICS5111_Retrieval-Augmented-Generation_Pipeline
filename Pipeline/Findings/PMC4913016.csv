"Tricholasphenol (trq) reduced the phosphorylation of pivotal factors in mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapks) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathways, which contribute to significantly less recruitment and infiltration of immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and subsequent suppression on toxic cytokines release, realizing a promising mitigation on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced airway inflammation in rats.",PMC4913016,PMC4913016_0
"Trq dose-dependently attenuated LPS-induced neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes infiltration and inhibited proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 on both messenger RNA (mRNA) transcription and protein synthesis levels, which were very beneficial to the resolution of inflammation.",PMC4913016,PMC4913016_1
"The suppressive actions of trq on LPS-induced airway inflammation and mucus overproduction might be due, at least in part, to the suppression on mapks and NF-κB signaling pathways by reducing phosphorylation of p38 mapks, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, IκB-α, and NF-κB p65.",PMC4913016,PMC4913016_2
"The study design specified that the underlying mechanisms of the suppressive actions of trq on LPS-induced airway inflammation and mucus overproduction might be due, at least in part, to the suppression on mapks and NF-κB signaling pathways.",PMC4913016,PMC4913016_3
"Clinical trials demonstrated that trq administration showed a potent effect on lowering the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-17 in plasma of patients under acute pulmonary conditions, which was very beneficial to the resolution of inflammation.",PMC4913016,PMC4913016_4
