"The study found that within 2 to 4 days after symptom onset, patients with severe influenza disease had significantly higher elisa titers for antibodies against the split-virion inactivated a(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine than patients with mild disease, suggesting an exaggerated nonneutralizing antibody response during early infection in severe cases.",PMC3393364,PMC3393364_0
"The study also found that patients requiring positive pressure ventilation, representing those with the most severe respiratory disease, had higher elisa titers than those who did not require positive pressure ventilation, indicating that the nonneutralizing antibody response was associated with severe respiratory disease.",PMC3393364,PMC3393364_1
"The study revealed that the amount of nonneutralizing antibody, as measured by the elisa/mn titer ratio, was higher for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease, suggesting that an exaggerated nonneutralizing antibody response during early infection may play a role in the outcome of influenza.",PMC3393364,PMC3393364_2
"The study showed that antibody avidity, as assessed by comparing the elisa od values with and without urea, was higher for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease, indicating that patients with severe disease have higher levels of secondary antibody production, presumably from memory B cells.",PMC3393364,PMC3393364_3
"The study found that antibody avidity, as measured by the antibody avidity index, was independently associated with severe disease, suggesting that antibody avidity may be a predictor for severe disease.",PMC3393364,PMC3393364_4
