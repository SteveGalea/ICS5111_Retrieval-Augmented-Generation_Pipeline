"In a study of 57 adults who received umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) for hematologic malignancies, viral infections were the most frequent pathogens observed, with cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation being the second most frequent pathogen. CMV reactivation was not associated with atg use, but only 3 patients had received this agent.",PMC6386816,PMC6386816_0
"Despite appropriate antiviral prophylaxis, fatal herpesvirus infections remained high after UCBT, with 8 episodes of herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation, 2 of which were severe and led to patient death. Acyclovir resistance was confirmed in 1 patient who died of disseminated HSV-1 infection.",PMC6386816,PMC6386816_1
"Bacterial infections were common throughout all time periods, and many were likely related to the presence of indwelling catheters. Infections with Enterobacteriaceae and VRE within the first 30 days after UCBT were associated with increased mortality.",PMC6386816,PMC6386816_2
The prolonged time to neutrophil engraftment after UCBT increases the period at which recipients are at high risk of life-threatening bacterial infections. Delayed neutrophil engraftment is associated with increased mortality.,PMC6386816,PMC6386816_3
"The high burden of disease early after UCBT underscores the need for aggressive surveillance for fungal infections and mold-active azole prophylaxis. Invasive aspergillosis was a major cause of death in the study population, but invasive Candida infections were rare. None of the 4 patients in the study cohort who died of invasive aspergillosis was receiving prophylaxis with a mold-active azole.",PMC6386816,PMC6386816_4
