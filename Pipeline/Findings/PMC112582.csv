"The mutant eav030f nsp10 protein, which contains the presumed viral helicase domain, does not appear to disrupt the replicative capabilities of the eav030f replicase, suggesting that the eav030f replicase still recognizes viral replication signals efficiently and that its processivity is not affected by the mutation (500 words).",PMC112582,PMC112582_0
"The eav030f genome is replicated very efficiently, and the resulting ratios of sg positive- to negative-stranded rNAs are similar to those found for the wild-type replicase, indicating that the efficiency with which the small amounts of sg negative strands are used to generate sg positive strands is unchanged (500 words).",PMC112582,PMC112582_1
"Low but significant levels of sg positive- and negative-stranded rNAs are produced in mutant eav030f, and the resulting ratios of sg positive- to negative-stranded rNAs are similar to those found for the wild-type replicase, suggesting that nsp10 plays an important role in an early step in transcription and may be directly or indirectly involved in the process by which the nascent sg strand is translocated during discontinuous transcription, from one trs on the template to another (500 words).",PMC112582,PMC112582_2
"RNA sequences surrounding the trs and genomic sequences immediately downstream of the leader have been reported to be involved in transcription, and nsp10 may be involved in the recognition of these RNA sequences by the transcription complex or interact with other protein factors that recognize these sequences (500 words).",PMC112582,PMC112582_3
"The mutant eav030f nsp10 protein, which contains two of the most conserved domains of the nidovirus replicase, dramatically interferes with the synthesis of sg mRNAs but does not block it completely, suggesting that the nsp10 replicase subunit or its precursors is an essential component of the replication and transcription machinery and that its processivity is not affected by the mutation in nsp10 (500 words).",PMC112582,PMC112582_4
