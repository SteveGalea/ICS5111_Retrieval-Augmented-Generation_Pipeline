"MMTV, a betaretrovirus that infects rodent cells, can also infect human cells less efficiently than murine cells. Repeated passaging in human cells leads to the emergence of variants with increased infectivity.",PMC4445801,PMC4445801_0
"Sequence analysis reveals that several regions within the viral genome are under strong positive selection pressure during viral replication in human cells, indicating adaptation to the human host.",PMC4445801,PMC4445801_1
"Mutations in the env gene, encoding the receptor binding site, are responsible for the increased infectivity of the variants in human cells. A single amino acid substitution, G42E, has been identified and shown to enhance viral binding and infectivity.",PMC4445801,PMC4445801_2
"Human TFR1, the cellular receptor for MMTV, is dispensable for infection, and another cell surface molecule mediates viral entry into human cells.",PMC4445801,PMC4445801_3
These findings explain the mechanism by which MMTV can form host-range variants in non-murine cells and shed light on how viruses gain the capability to infect new hosts.,PMC4445801,PMC4445801_4
