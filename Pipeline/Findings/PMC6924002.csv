"In patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma, azd8848 (a TLR7 agonist) significantly reduced the late asthmatic response (LAR) fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) by 27% compared to placebo at 1 week after treatment.",PMC6924002,PMC6924002_0
"Azd8848 reduced post-allergen challenge methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) compared to placebo at 1 week post-dosing, but this effect was not sustained at 4 weeks.",PMC6924002,PMC6924002_1
"There was no significant difference between the two groups in plasma cytokine, sputum TH2 cytokine, or eosinophil responses post-allergen challenge at 1 week after treatment.",PMC6924002,PMC6924002_2
"The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups, and azd8848 was generally well-tolerated.",PMC6924002,PMC6924002_3
TLR7 agonists could potentially reduce allergen responsiveness by stimulating type 1 interferon responses to down-regulate the dominant TH2 responses in patients with allergic asthma.,PMC6924002,PMC6924002_4
