A vaccine containing a fusion protein composed of the ecmx antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and the CM7 antigen from M. tuberculosis CFP1027 was found to provide protection against M. tuberculosis in mice.,PMC5718803,PMC5718803_0
The vaccine was also found to be effective in preventing dissemination of the bacteria to the lungs and spleen of mice.,PMC5718803,PMC5718803_1
The vaccine was shown to significantly reduce the bacterial load in the lungs of mice four weeks after challenge with M. tuberculosis.,PMC5718803,PMC5718803_2
"The vaccine was found to elicit a strong immune response to the ecmx antigen, which is a key antigen in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.",PMC5718803,PMC5718803_3
The vaccine was also shown to be effective in preventing the dissemination of M. tuberculosis to the draining lymph nodes of mice.,PMC5718803,PMC5718803_4
Bacterial load in the lungs of mice was significantly reduced by the vaccine four weeks after challenge with M. tuberculosis.,PMC5718803,PMC5718803_5
"The vaccine was found to elicit a strong immune response to the CM7 antigen, which is also a key antigen in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.",PMC5718803,PMC5718803_6
"The vaccine was shown to provide protection against M. tuberculosis in mice, and this protection was found to be as effective as that provided by the BCG vaccine, which is currently used to prevent tuberculosis in humans.",PMC5718803,PMC5718803_7
The vaccine was also found to be as effective as the BCG vaccine in preventing dissemination of M. tuberculosis to the lungs and spleen of mice.,PMC5718803,PMC5718803_8
"The vaccine was shown to significantly reduce the bacterial load in the lungs of mice four weeks after challenge with M. tuberculosis, which was comparable to the reduction observed in mice vaccinated with the BCG vaccine.",PMC5718803,PMC5718803_9
"The vaccine was found to elicit a strong immune response to the ecmx antigen in mice, which was comparable to the response observed in mice vaccinated with the BCG vaccine.",PMC5718803,PMC5718803_10
"The vaccine was also shown to elicit a strong immune response to the CM7 antigen in mice, which was comparable to the response observed in mice vaccinated with the BCG vaccine",PMC5718803,PMC5718803_11
