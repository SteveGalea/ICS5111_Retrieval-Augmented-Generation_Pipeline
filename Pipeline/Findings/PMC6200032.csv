The development of transgenic cyp1a1–ren2 rats has allowed increased control of the study of hypertension due to the ability to induce hypertension through dietary manipulation in a dose-dependent fashion.,PMC6200032,PMC6200032_0
Cyp1a1–ren2 rats maintained on decreased titrated doses of dietary i3c can tolerate prolonged periods of sustained hypertension but without the ill effects reported by others.,PMC6200032,PMC6200032_1
"Cyp1a1–ren2 rats have a relatively slow ramping of blood pressure, which is more closely related to the development of hypertension in the clinical setting.",PMC6200032,PMC6200032_2
"The performance (or productivity) of a cyp1a1–ren2 rat colony is comparable to common outbred laboratory rat strains, despite being an inbred transgenic strain.",PMC6200032,PMC6200032_3
"Cyp1a1–ren2 rats produced large litters (10 to 16 pups), which is much larger than reported for the background strain for cyp1a1–ren2 rats from both envigo and janvire laboratories.",PMC6200032,PMC6200032_4
