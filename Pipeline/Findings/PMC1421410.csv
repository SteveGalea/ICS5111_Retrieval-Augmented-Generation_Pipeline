"The study reports an efficient, specific, and sensitive assay for detecting h5n1 influenza virus isolates, with a lower limit of detection in the picogram range, equivalent to 1 Ã— 103 copies, and a wide variety of h5n1 influenza virus isolates from archived samples from both humans and avian sources were successfully detected.",PMC1421410,PMC1421410_0
"The assay's design allows for accurate and specific detection of viral RNA, with a lower risk of cross-contamination due to its one-step single-tube reaction, and the results suggest that the primers are specific for h5n1, making it useful for the early detection and monitoring of avian influenza outbreaks.",PMC1421410,PMC1421410_1
"The study highlights the strong influence of sample type on viral RNA detection accuracy and sensitivity, and the rapid one-step single-tube reaction, with a lower limit of detection, can be a cost-effective, gel-based system, especially in regions where real-time PCR platforms and equipment may not be available.",PMC1421410,PMC1421410_2
"The results of the study strongly suggest that the primers are specific for h5n1, which can be very useful for the early detection and monitoring of avian influenza outbreaks.",PMC1421410,PMC1421410_3
"The study underscores the need for more known h5n1 influenza virus isolates from archived samples from humans, as the availability of human samples is difficult due to the low number of human infections at this point. However, the results strongly suggest that the primers are specific for h5n1, which can be very useful for the early detection and monitoring of avian influenza outbreaks.",PMC1421410,PMC1421410_4
