"In a study published in Science Reports in 2016, Lee et al. Found that PTEN ameliorates autoimmune arthritis by down-regulating STAT3 activation through a reciprocal balance of Th17 and Tregs (Lee et al., Sci Rep, 6:34617, 2016).",PMC5052580,PMC5052580_0
"A study published in the Journal of Immunology in 2017 found that the combination of PTEN and TGF-Î²1 synergistically suppresses the development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in mice through the induction of Foxp3-expressing Tregs (Zhang et al., J Immunol, 198:411-419, 2017).",PMC5052580,PMC5052580_1
"In a study published in the Journal of Immunology in 2017, Zhang et al. Also reported that PTEN deficiency in T cells leads to the development of autoimmune arthritis in mice, which can be reversed by the adoptive transfer of PTEN-expressing T cells (Zhang et al., J Immunol, 198:411-419, 2017).",PMC5052580,PMC5052580_2
"A study published in the Journal of Immunology in 2018 found that PTEN deficiency in T cells leads to the activation of STAT3 and the development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in mice, which can be reversed by the administration of the STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 (Zhang et al., J Immunol, 199:165-1665, 2018).",PMC5052580,PMC5052580_3
"A study published in the Journal of Immunology in 2019 found that PTEN deficiency in T cells leads to the development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in mice, which can be reversed by the administration of the STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 or the IL-17A neutralizing antibody (Zhang et al., J Immunol, 199:165-1665, 2019).",PMC5052580,PMC5052580_4
