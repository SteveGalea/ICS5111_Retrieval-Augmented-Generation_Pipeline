"The novel mvttioin+adim vaccine regimen, which primes the mucosal system with a replicating vaccinia virus and boosts with a nonreplicating adenovirus vector, induced exceptionally high levels of protective immunity against a single high-dose mucosal challenge with sivmac239 in Chinese rhesus macaques.",PMC3648167,PMC3648167_0
"One animal in the study was completely protected from infection, while the others displayed significantly lower peak and set-point viral loads than those of the control groups.",PMC3648167,PMC3648167_1
"The siv-specific immune protection induced by the mvttioin+adim regimen was associated with high levels of cd8+ t cell elispot responses against gag and pol, as well as gag-specific ifn-γ+ tnf-α+ cd8+ tem cell responses.",PMC3648167,PMC3648167_2
"The mvttioin+adim regimen combined key correlates induced by other promising vaccine approaches, such as persistently replicating cytomegalovirus-based vaccines and nonreplicating poxvirus and adenovirus vector-based vaccines.",PMC3648167,PMC3648167_3
The exceptional protective capability and unique immunologic correlates induced by the mvttioin+adim regimen highlight the potential of a combination of mucosal priming with a replicating vaccinia virus and a nonreplicating adenovirus boost for the development of an effective vaccine against HIV-1 infection.,PMC3648167,PMC3648167_4
