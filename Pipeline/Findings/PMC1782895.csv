"The study found that the periphery of thymectomized old mice has a lower representation of peripheral virgin t cells compared to young mice. This suggests that bone marrow is a primary site for memory t-cell trafficking and prolonged localization, as memory t cells preferentially home to the bone marrow rather than to lymph nodes.",PMC1782895,PMC1782895_0
"The study showed that both antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 t cells migrate to the bone marrow after immunization and can still be found there several weeks later. This finding, together with the observation that memory-phenotype t cells preferentially home to the bone marrow rather than to lymph nodes, suggests that bone marrow is an important site of memory t-cell trafficking and prolonged localization.",PMC1782895,PMC1782895_1
"The study found that the percentage of cells showing a functional response to stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α), a potent chemoattractant for haemopoietic progenitor cells, is higher in the memory t-cell subset than in the virgin t-cell subset. This suggests that memory t cells involved in the second pathway, which controls t-cell migration to internal organs, also recirculate through the bone marrow.",PMC1782895,PMC1782895_2
"The study found that the cells constantly circulating in the lymphoid periphery, with a memory phenotype, preferentially migrate to the bone marrow. This implies that the bone marrow compartment for t cells is limited and saturable, and that the cells are displaced by other rival t cells competing for the same enclosed 'niche'.",PMC1782895,PMC1782895_3
"The study found that il-15 and il-7 might provide survival/proliferation signals to memory CD8 t cells in the bone marrow, and that these cells persist in the bone marrow for enough time to receive these signals. This suggests that the bone marrow is a site for memory t-cell survival/proliferation, and that these cells return to the periphery from the bone marrow as they are displaced by other rival t cells competing for the same enclosed 'niche'.",PMC1782895,PMC1782895_4
