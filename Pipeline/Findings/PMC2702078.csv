"The transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans is a serious threat to global health, as evidenced by the 1918 pandemic and more recent outbreaks, such as the 1957 and 1968 pandemics.",PMC2702078,PMC2702078_0
"Swine, as intermediate hosts, can serve as ""mixing vessels"" for avian and human influenza viruses, facilitating the generation of novel influenza viruses capable of infecting humans.",PMC2702078,PMC2702078_1
The creation of novel reassortant swine influenza viruses with zoonotic and pandemic potential could happen in modern swine facilities in the backyard of a highly industrialized country in North America or Western Europe.,PMC2702078,PMC2702078_2
"The exact mode and sites of influenza a (h5n1) virus acquisition in the respiratory tract of humans are incompletely understood, but recent studies have found that the receptors preferentially binding avian influenza viruses are located in the lower portions of the human respiratory system, explaining how avian influenza viruses can directly infect humans and also why human-to-human transmission with non-adapted avian influenza viruses is rather limited.",PMC2702078,PMC2702078_3
"The crux is that when an avian influenza pandemic does begin, it will emerge in a non-linear fashion that will be difficult to contain, as evidenced by the recent cases of human infection with h1n1 avian influenza viruses in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as the potential for h5n1 viruses to cause human disease with high mortality and to pose the threat of a pandemic.",PMC2702078,PMC2702078_4
