"The study identified several antigenic sites in the novel coronavirus, including a highly antigenic loop region between the predicted n and m helices of the spike protein (s2 domain) and a dispersed epitope-rich region in an unknown protein (3a).",PMC1075701,PMC1075701_0
"Complementary antibodies to the identified immunodominant site in the s2 domain were present in plasma samples from a significant proportion (82.5%) of convalescent sars patients, and antibodies to this site were effective for virus neutralization.",PMC1075701,PMC1075701_1
"While antibodies to the dispersed epitope-rich region in the 3a protein were present in plasma samples from a significant proportion (40%) of convalescent sars patients, their exact functions remain unknown, but they should positively contribute to neutralization of infected cells and augment immune protection against the pathogen.",PMC1075701,PMC1075701_2
The study revealed that the short epitope-rich fragment of the spike s2 protein between amino acids 787 and 809 is an important antigenic site through which the human humoral immune system recognizes and interacts with the sars cov.,PMC1075701,PMC1075701_3
"The study found that among the many epitopes determined in the phage panning, very few were located in the viral envelope proteins m and e, and that the only identified immunodominant site was located in the loop region between the predicted n and m helices of the spike protein (s2 domain).",PMC1075701,PMC1075701_4
