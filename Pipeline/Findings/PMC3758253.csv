"Ebola virus protein vp35 inhibits the production of interferon (IFN)-α/β, a key component of the innate immune response, by preventing the phosphorylation and dimerization of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and blocking the activation of protein kinase R (PKR) [3, 16, 17, 18]. This ability is mapped to the c-terminal dsRNA-binding domain of vp35 [20, 21].",PMC3758253,PMC3758253_0
"The structure of the Ebola virus protein vp35 reveals that it sequesters dsRNA and prevents it from being recognized by immune sentry proteins, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RGI) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), by forming an asymmetric dimer that wraps around the end of the dsRNA [22, 23••]. The vp35 structures of Ebola virus and the nonpathogenic Reston virus (Restv) are largely similar, but differences in the linker between the two subdomains of vp35 suggest reasons why Restv is nonpathogenic to humans remain unclear [22, 24••].",PMC3758253,PMC3758253_1
"The structure of the Lasa virus nucleoprotein (NP) reveals that it has a mixed, five-stranded β sheet with one antiparallel strand (β2) and six α helices connected by loops, including a long basic 'arm' off one side [40••, 41••]. The structure unexpectedly reveals that NP functions like an exonuclease, with d389, e391, d466, d533, and h528 in the active site [40••]. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that NP readily hydrolyzes an 18 bp dsRNA oligonucleotide in the 3′–5′ direction but has no effect on ssRNA, ssDNA, or dsDNA [40••].",PMC3758253,PMC3758253_2
