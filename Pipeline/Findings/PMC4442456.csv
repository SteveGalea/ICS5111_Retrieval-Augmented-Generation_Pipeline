"Mnv-1 infection causes a prolongation of the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle in Raw264.7 and Raw-blue cells, which is accompanied by a decrease in G1/S phase progression. This arrest benefits Mnv-1 replication by providing a more favorable environment for viral genome synthesis, as ribonucleotide pools are not depleted during this phase.",PMC4442456,PMC4442456_0
"Mnv-1 infection in Raw264.7 cells causes a decrease in the expression of cyclin A, which is proposed to be a cause of the G1/S phase arrest. This downregulation of cyclin A expression is not observed in Raw-blue cells that are released from quiescence, suggesting that the arrest is host-driven.",PMC4442456,PMC4442456_1
"Mnv-1 infection in Raw264.7 and Raw-blue cells causes an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase, which is favored for Mnv-1 replication. This finding is consistent with the effect of Mnv-1 on the cell cycle, as it is proposed to prolong the G1 phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting G1/S transition, providing a more beneficial environment for Mnv-1 replication.",PMC4442456,PMC4442456_2
"Mnv-1 infection in Raw264.7 cells causes a delay in apoptosis for up to 12 hours post-infection. This finding suggests that Mnv-1-induced cell cycle arrest may prevent early death from apoptosis, allowing time for Mnv-1 replication.",PMC4442456,PMC4442456_3
"Mnv-1 infection causes a decrease in the expression of host cell cycle regulators, including cyclin D2, cyclin E, thymidine kinase 1 (TK1), ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2), and deoxyuridine triphosphatase (DUT). This finding suggests that Mnv-1 may have adapted to better replicate under these conditions by inhibiting the expression of host cell cycle regulators.",PMC4442456,PMC4442456_4
