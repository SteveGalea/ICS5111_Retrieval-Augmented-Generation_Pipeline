"In a study examining the age and duration of infection in hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemics, the authors found that the age of the most recent common ancestor (tmrca) was the strongest predictor of diversity in an epidemic, with a median value of 104 years (interquartile range: 67-139). This finding supports the use of tmrca to estimate the age of an epidemic and highlights its potential utility in real-time prediction.",PMC3678333,PMC3678333_0
"The authors also found evidence for epidemics with three distinct patterns of dynamics: simple (si), substructure-maintaining (sis), and structure-losing (sir). In the case of the si and sis models, analytical solutions for the effective population size as a function of time could be obtained. The authors noted that the intrinsic growth rate (r0) could not be estimated analytically for the sir model, but assuming no co-infection (β2 = 0) simplified the system of differential equations to a single ordinary differential equation that could be solved numerically.",PMC3678333,PMC3678333_1
"The authors identified 18 datasets of HCV that met their incorporation criteria, and calculated mean pairwise genetic diversity (π) and collated data on subtype, prevalence, host population size, and population density. They used multiple sequence alignment and multiple regression to explore the effect of covariates on π, including tmrca, n0, and r0, which was found to be a significant predictor of π.",PMC3678333,PMC3678333_2
"The authors noted that the effective population size was dependent on the proportion of susceptible hosts (s), and that equations defining a system of differential equations to be solved together could be used to model changes in metapopulation dynamics over time. They implemented this as an extension to beast, a software package for Bayesian inference, and noted that the logistic growth function used in the sir model was different from the traditional carrying capacity.",PMC3678333,PMC3678333_3
"In their study, the authors found that the effective population size was well identified in all 18 datasets, and that the number of recovered individuals was initially zero, simplifying the system of differential equations in the sir model to a single ordinary differential equation that could be solved numerically. They also noted that the authors excluded a further 10 datasets that had small sample size, evidence of re",PMC3678333,PMC3678333_4
