"A review of the effect of warm weather showed a strong correlation between high temperatures or humidity and the use of medical care during hajj. More than 1000 deaths from heatstroke were reported in 2000, and more than 18,000 people needing treatment in emergency departments for heat exhaustion during summertime hajj. Heat-related mortality and morbidity are preventable, with the risk of heat-related death increased in older individuals and those with pre-existing cardiovascular, pulmonary, and psychiatric disorders. Prevention measures include using sun protection equipment's, drinking adequate rehydration solution, avoiding prolonged exposure to heat during hajj activities, and using fans, cooling buses, places, and accommodation.",PMC4882208,PMC4882208_0
"Over the history of hajj, there have been several large crowd disasters, including a tent fire in Min√° in 1975, which killed 200 pilgrims, and two bombs that exploded in 1989, killing 16 pilgrims. These incidents have led to efforts to solve crowd difficulties by scientific means, such as crowd simulation models, video monitoring, and changes in the construction of the transport system for hajj. As a result, no stampedes have been reported since 2006.",PMC4882208,PMC4882208_1
"The annual hajj pilgrimage, which attracts approximately 3 million pilgrims during 1 week, presents a unique challenge for emergency medicine training programs due to the high acuity of emergencies and the multicultural background of the pilgrims. Residents in Saudi Arabian emergency medicine programs are required to complete a one-month hajj rotation, during which they gain exposure to all kinds of emergencies, both traumatic and medical, as well as to pre-hospital care intervention and evacuation planning.",PMC4882208,PMC4882208_2
"Research is critical to develop planning, risk management, crowded management, and policies and guidelines to identify issues and possible solutions. The Hajj Research Center in Mecca annually conducts research and submits recommendations to the high authority of hajj for evaluation.",PMC4882208,PMC4882208_3
"The review article confirms that hajj is the oldest and largest mass gathering in human history, and the size of the gathering has a significant impact on health response. The population is diverse, and health facilities are limited around hajj",PMC4882208,PMC4882208_4
