"The study constructed a tumor-inducing virus (TVM) to express American cockroach major allergens in Chinese cabbage, allowing for the production of a plant-made edible vaccine.",PMC6066233,PMC6066233_0
"Oral administration of this vaccine prevented the development of allergen-specific IgE production, airway hyperresponsiveness, type 2 cytokine production, and lung inflammation in a murine allergic asthma model.",PMC6066233,PMC6066233_1
"The vaccine consistently provided better effects in terms of inhibition of development of allergen-specific IgE production, airway hyperresponsiveness, type 2 cytokine production, and lung inflammation compared to a vaccine encoding full-length allergens.",PMC6066233,PMC6066233_2
This is the first report to describe the successful use of a TVM viral vector-expressed cockroach allergen given as an oral vaccine to prevent the development of allergic asthma and allergic inflammation later in life following exposure to cockroach allergen in a mouse model.,PMC6066233,PMC6066233_3
"The study suggests that plant-made edible vaccination is a promising strategy for treating allergic airway diseases due to its low cost and potential for mass production. However, further study is required to determine its efficacy in treating pre-existing allergic diseases with the same efficacy as conventional allergen-specific vaccines or sublingual allergen vaccines.",PMC6066233,PMC6066233_4
