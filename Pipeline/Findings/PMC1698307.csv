"All seven RT-PCR methods had 100% specificity but low sensitivities, ranging from 34 to 40%.",PMC1698307,PMC1698307_0
"Sensitivities varied by time of specimen collection: 46-62% for specimens collected â‰¤7 days from symptom onset, 58-75% for specimens collected 8-21 days after symptom onset, and 13-19% for specimens collected >21 days after symptom onset.",PMC1698307,PMC1698307_1
"When comparing individual RT-PCR assay results to a modified gold standard of three or more assays yielding a positive result, sensitivities improved (range, 83% to 96%).",PMC1698307,PMC1698307_2
"All methods were comparable in terms of sensitivities and specificities, except for the cortex magazorb method, which had lower sensitivity (34%) compared to the other methods.",PMC1698307,PMC1698307_3
"The newer real-time RT-PCR assays, with newer extraction methodologies, are highly specific and at least as sensitive as conventional nested RT-PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV. Major advantages of these assays are their ease of use and rapidity.",PMC1698307,PMC1698307_4
