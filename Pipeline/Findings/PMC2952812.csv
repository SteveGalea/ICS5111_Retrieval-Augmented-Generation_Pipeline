"Boop is a pathological lesion characterized by proliferation of connective tissue that forms intraluminal polyps within small airways, sometimes resulting in complete obstruction, and is associated with fibrosis, differentiation and migration markers of myofibroblasts, and extracellular matrix remodeling.",PMC2952812,PMC2952812_0
"Boop is not commonly reported in animals, but has been identified in pigs with chronic respiratory syndrome and is associated with porcine circovirus type 2 infection.",PMC2952812,PMC2952812_1
"Boop is characterized by copious coughing, dyspnea, and crackle, and affected pigs often show moderate to marked multifocal peribronchial and peribronchiolar fibrosis, which may extend into the airway lamina propria.",PMC2952812,PMC2952812_2
"The activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and 9, which participate in extracellular matrix degradation and regulation, are significantly increased in swine boop compared to normal tissue, and opn, a multifunctional matricellular cytokine required for fibroblast differentiation to myofibroblasts, is strongly expressed in swine boop.",PMC2952812,PMC2952812_3
"Boop is associated with chronic respiratory syndrome and is characterized by intraluminal organization, which is defined as the accumulation of connective tissue plugs within small airways, and may result in complete obstruction.",PMC2952812,PMC2952812_4
