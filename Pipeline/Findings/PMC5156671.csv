"The study identified three first-order lineages, seven second-order divisions, 13 third-order divisions, and eight fourth-order divisions in a data set comprising 7,070 h1 ha swine iav sequences from 2010 to the present.",PMC5156671,PMC5156671_0
The study developed a classification tool based on a bifurcating scaffold phylogenetic tree to assign a query sequence to a branch in the tree and assign a clade to the query based on the clades represented in the local neighborhood of its placement.,PMC5156671,PMC5156671_1
The study restricted comments on abundance and geographical dispersion to sequences from 2010 to the present because sequences from the 1900s and early 2000s were not representative of the relative abundance of different swine iav clades.,PMC5156671,PMC5156671_2
"The study found that viruses assigned “-like” classifications were often transitional, occurring prior to or during the emergence of a new clade that successfully expands onward.",PMC5156671,PMC5156671_3
"The study noted that the data to date have been implemented successfully to classify avian ha/h5 sequences, distinguish new pandemic 2009 h1 viruses from earlier seasonal h1 viruses in humans and other hosts, and classify u.s. Swine h1 ha phylogenetic clades. These findings provide important insights into the evolution and classification of swine iav h1 ha viruses.",PMC5156671,PMC5156671_4
