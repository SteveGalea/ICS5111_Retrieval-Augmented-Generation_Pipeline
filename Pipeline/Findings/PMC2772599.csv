"The pandemic (h1n1) 2009 virus, which emerged in April 2009, has a higher transmissibility than seasonal influenza viruses. This is supported by early reports and enhanced sensitivity in real-time RT-PCR assays for pandemic (h1n1) 2009 virus.",PMC2772599,PMC2772599_0
"Nucleic acid sequencing (NAS) provides a rapid and sensitive means of detection of respiratory virus infections, including those caused by pandemic (h1n1) 2009 virus, with enhanced sensitivities, specificities, and turnaround times compared to traditional methods.",PMC2772599,PMC2772599_1
"Six segments of the currently circulating pandemic (h1n1) 2009 virus are related to swine viruses from North America and Europe/Asia, with two distinct lineages of swine influenza A virus of the h1n1 subtype currently circulating within the North American and European pig populations.",PMC2772599,PMC2772599_2
"The pandemic potential of the circulating pandemic (h1n1) 2009 virus is uncertain, as antigenic changes in the virus can vary depending on whether the antigenic changes in the virus are incremental or if the mutations in the viral genome go from point to point in a confined space.",PMC2772599,PMC2772599_3
"Sensitive real-time RT-PCR assays based on available sequences for pandemic (h1n1) 2009 virus have been developed for rapid subtyping, in conjunction with influenza A virus screening and seasonal H1/H3 subtyping assays for the detection of influenza A viruses and monitoring of pandemic (h1n1) 2009 virus infections.",PMC2772599,PMC2772599_4
