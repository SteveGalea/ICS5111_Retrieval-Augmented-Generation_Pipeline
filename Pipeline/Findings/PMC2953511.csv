"The study identified 21 cases of h5n1 virus infection in China between February 2008 and August 2010, with the majority (81%) occurring in Guangdong province.",PMC2953511,PMC2953511_0
"Viral load and quantitative proinflammatory factor levels were determined by quantified real-time RT-PCR, and the correlation between viral load and host response was analyzed using Pearson's correlation test.",PMC2953511,PMC2953511_1
"The study found that viral load in tissues was associated with increased levels of proinflammatory factors, including IP-10, MIP-3β, RANTES, and TNF-α.",PMC2953511,PMC2953511_2
"The study also identified a positive correlation between viral load and host response, suggesting a potential role for these factors in the pathogenesis of h5n1 infection.",PMC2953511,PMC2953511_3
The study used a two-step peroxidase method for immunohistochemical stain and double labeling with IHC and ISH to identify co-localization of viral genome and specific cellular markers.,PMC2953511,PMC2953511_4
"The study used logarithm to present viral-load levels in different tissues, and Pearson's correlation coefficient to analyze the correlation between viral load and host response.",PMC2953511,PMC2953511_5
"The study used dextran sulfate to inhibit the binding of viral RNA to host cell membrane proteins, potentially reducing the severity of h5n1 infection.",PMC2953511,PMC2953511_6
"The study used ribavirin to reduce viral replication in vivo, potentially reducing the severity of h5n1 infection.",PMC2953511,PMC2953511_7
"The study used oseltamivir to inhibit viral polymerase activity, potentially reducing the severity of h5n1 infection.",PMC2953511,PMC2953511_8
"The study used zanamivir to inhibit viral polymerase activity, potentially reducing the severity of h5n1 infection.",PMC2953511,PMC2953511_9
"The study used isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as a solvent for the antiviral drugs, potentially improving their efficacy.",PMC2953511,PMC2953511_10
"The study used chloroquine as an antiviral drug, potentially reducing the severity of h5n1 infection by inhibiting viral replication in acidic endosomes.",PMC2953511,PMC2953511_11
