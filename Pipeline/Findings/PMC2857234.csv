"A study analyzing data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that 78 mammal genera imported into the United States are capable of carrying rabies viruses, making it the zoonosis with the greatest number of affected genera.",PMC2857234,PMC2857234_0
"The study also identified 57 mammal genera imported into the U.S. That are capable of carrying Bacillus anthracis, the bacterium that causes anthrax.",PMC2857234,PMC2857234_1
"Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which includes strains of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, was found to be capable of infecting 48 mammal genera imported into the U.S.",PMC2857234,PMC2857234_2
"The study revealed that the greatest number of affected genera for any risk zoonosis was found for canis (dogs) and felis (cats), both with 14 affected genera each.",PMC2857234,PMC2857234_3
"The study also highlighted the broad nature of risk associated with importing wild animals, as many opportunities exist for key zoonotic pathogens to be imported into the U.S., and the risks associated with importations of wild animals in general go beyond quantifying the prevalence of the various pathogens in each wildlife host, as determining this prevalence is beyond the scope of the analysis.",PMC2857234,PMC2857234_4
