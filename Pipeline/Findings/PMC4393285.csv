"In a study of reported physical contacts in great Britain, a contact matrix was found to have a high number of child-dominated contacts, with adults making fewer contacts than children. This suggests that children may play a significant role in the transmission of respiratory infections.",PMC4393285,PMC4393285_0
"A simulation study using this contact matrix showed that when the probability of infection is introduced into an under 20 age group, the estimated reproduction number (R) is significantly lower than when infection is introduced into an over 20 age group. This highlights the importance of considering age-specific susceptibility in R estimation.",PMC4393285,PMC4393285_1
"In a study of reported physical contacts in Southern China, a contact matrix was found to have a high number of adult-dominated contacts, with adults making more contacts than children. This suggests that adults may be more important than children in the transmission of respiratory infections in this setting.",PMC4393285,PMC4393285_2
"A simulation study using this contact matrix showed that when the probability of infection is introduced into an over 20 age group, the estimated R is significantly lower than when infection is introduced into a generic adult-dominated next generation matrix. This highlights the importance of considering age-specific contact patterns in R estimation.",PMC4393285,PMC4393285_3
"In a study of reported physical contacts in eight European countries, a contact matrix was found to have an average number of contacts across all age groups. This suggests that age-specific susceptibility may not be important in R estimation for these settings. However, when the simulation model assumes the average contact patterns across these settings, the estimated R is significantly lower than when infection is introduced into an over 20 age group. This highlights the importance of considering age-specific contact patterns in R estimation for settings where adults have lower contact rates than children.",PMC4393285,PMC4393285_4
