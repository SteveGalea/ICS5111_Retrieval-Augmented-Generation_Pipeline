"This study aimed to develop a new type of therapeutic hbv vaccine by modifying the hbv surface gene, hbsag, with crt, a ubiquitously expressed ca2+ binding protein in endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells. Crt-hbsag fusion gene recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine was constructed to enhance the immunogenicity by improving the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i presentation of linked peptide/protein. The adenovirus vectors used in this study are suitable for delivering genes of crt fused hbsag to liver tissues to suppress and eliminate chronic hbv infection and hbsag-positive hepatocellular carcinoma. This is the first time to construct the crt-hbsag gene recombinant adenovirus as a therapeutic vaccine for hbv infection.",PMC2890950,PMC2890950_0
"Previous studies have shown that crt enhances the mhc class i presentation of linked peptide/protein, making it an effective vaccination strategy for antigen-specific cancer treatment. This study found that the hbv surface gene, hbsag, was fused with crt to improve immunogenicity by enhancing the mhc class i presentation of linked peptide/protein.",PMC2890950,PMC2890950_1
"The adenovirus vectors used in this study are suitable for delivering genes of crt fused hbsag to liver tissues to suppress and eliminate chronic hbv infection and hbsag-positive hepatocellular carcinoma, as they can infect a great variety of cell types and tissues in both dividing and non-dividing cells. This characteristic, together with being relatively easy for preparation and purification, has led to their extensive use as gene vectors.",PMC2890950,PMC2890950_2
"The research frontiers of hbv therapeutic vaccines focus on modifying hbsag to enhance its immunogenicity. In this study, crt-hbsag fusion gene recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine was constructed to enhance the immunogenicity by improving the mhc class i presentation of linked peptide/protein.",PMC2890950,PMC2890950_3
"There are approximately four hundred million chronic hbv patients in the world, and effective therapeutic vaccines are needed urgently. The hb",PMC2890950,PMC2890950_4
