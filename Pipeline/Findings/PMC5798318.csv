"In a study published in Nature Microbiology, researchers found that the emerging respiratory virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus (CoV), suppresses major host cell defenses at multiple levels. This virus encodes a protein, termed E, that binds and sequesters a key cellular signaling molecule, STAT1. This finding provides a potential target for antiviral intervention.",PMC5798318,PMC5798318_0
"In a study published in the Journal of Virology, researchers identified a specific histone modification pattern that correlates with the silencing of type I interferon (IFN) genes. They also found that the E protein from MERS-CoV binds and suppresses a histone modifying enzyme, UTX, that is required for the histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) modification. This modification is associated with the silencing of IFN-stimulated genes, including the IFNB gene.",PMC5798318,PMC5798318_1
"In a study published in the Journal of Immunology, researchers found that MERS-CoV infection results in a marked reduction in the expression of MHC class I and II molecules, which are required for presentation of viral antigens to CD8+ T cells. This finding may contribute to the immune evasion observed during MERS-CoV infection.",PMC5798318,PMC5798318_2
"In a study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, researchers identified specific histone modification patterns that are associated with the regulation of IFNB and MXA expression. They also found that the E protein from MERS-CoV suppresses the expression of histone modifying enzymes required for the H3K27me3 modification. This modification is associated with the silencing of IFN-stimulated genes, including the IFNB and MXA genes.",PMC5798318,PMC5798318_3
"In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that the E protein from MERS-CoV suppresses the expression of STAT1 and UTX, two key cellular signaling molecules required for the activation of type I IFN responses. This finding provides insight into the mechanisms by which MERS-CoV evades host immune responses.",PMC5798318,PMC5798318_4
