"In patients with Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), traditional management options include prone/lateral positioning, nasopharyngeal airway, tracheotomy, and tongue-lip adhesion (TLA).",PMC6211851,PMC6211851_0
"TLA is a reliable temporizing measure to treat clinically significant airway obstruction in PRS infants, but its effect on resolving OSA is unpredictable.",PMC6211851,PMC6211851_1
"In PRS patients, early workup for adenotonsillar hypertrophy should be considered due to the unpredictable effect of TLA on resolving OSA.",PMC6211851,PMC6211851_2
"Prolonged TLA can result in serious impacts on neuromuscular glossal and mandibular alveolar development, leading to a severely retroclined mandibular alveolus, embedded primary incisors in the floor of the mouth, and a steep dolichofacial mandibular growth pattern.",PMC6211851,PMC6211851_3
"Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) is a mandibular lengthening technique frequently used in the treatment of micrognathia, leading to an improvement in respiratory status and significant airway stability, with a greater airway stability compared to TLA.",PMC6211851,PMC6211851_4
