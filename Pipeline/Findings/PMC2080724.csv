"In a cohort of 47 Hong Kong children and adolescents with a median age of 11 years, impaired aerobic capacity was found at 6 and 15 months after diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection, with a median value of 24.5 ml/kg/min at both time points.",PMC2080724,PMC2080724_0
"The mechanism for reduced aerobic capacity is not fully understood, but it is probably a result of impaired perfusion to the lungs at peak exercise and deconditioning.",PMC2080724,PMC2080724_1
"At 6 months, patients with residual radiological abnormalities had a significantly lower oxygen pulse and trended towards decreased petCO2, indicating a high degree of alveolar ventilation-perfusion ratio mismatching.",PMC2080724,PMC2080724_2
"At 15 months, patients with residual radiological abnormalities had a significantly higher petCO2 and trended towards a higher vAT, indicating improved blood oxygenation in the lungs with time.",PMC2080724,PMC2080724_3
"Both maximal and submaximal responses indicate that the impairment in aerobic capacity in this patient group is probably related to an increased physiological dead space, resulting from lung perfusion impairment during exercise.",PMC2080724,PMC2080724_4
