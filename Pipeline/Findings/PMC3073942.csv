"A homology model of the metallo-β-lactamase NDM-1 has been successfully generated using iTASS and the crystal structure of VIM-1 as a template. The model was found to have a high degree of accuracy, with 93.1% residues located in the ""core"" and ""allowed"" regions, and all bond lengths and angles within the allowed limits.",PMC3073942,PMC3073942_0
"The NDM-1 binding pocket was found to be formed by nine residues, with met3 and Phe6 providing van der Waals interactions to the antibiotic drugs. Hydrogen bonds were also identified between the antibiotic drugs and residues Glu88 and Thr126, allowing for recognition and cleavage of the amide bond in the β-lactam ring.",PMC3073942,PMC3073942_1
"A catalytic mechanism was proposed for NDM-1, with Asp60 acting as the general base that activates the water nucleophile, and the protonation of Asp60 resulting in the cleavage of its bond to the metal ion.",PMC3073942,PMC3073942_2
"The model suggested that the NDM-1 active site presents two metal ion binding sites, with the zinc ion in the His site having a higher occupancy than that in the Cys site.",PMC3073942,PMC3073942_3
"The model provided insights into the drug resistance problem, as NDM-1 was found to be able to inactivate both imipenem and meropenem through the cleavage of their amide bonds in the β-lactam ring.",PMC3073942,PMC3073942_4
