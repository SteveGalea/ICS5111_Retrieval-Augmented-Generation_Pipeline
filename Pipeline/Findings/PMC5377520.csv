"The study found that during the progression stage, there were persistent abnormalities in CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells, CD8+PD-1+ T cells, CD4+IL-4+ T cells, CD4+PD-1+ T cells, Tregs, and Th17 cells in patients with severe h7n9 infection, indicating persistent abnormalities of these T cell subsets in patients who have suffered from h7n9 infection.",PMC5377520,PMC5377520_0
"The study found that during recovery, the frequency of CD8+PD-1+ T cells and Tregs showed a mild downward trend in the majority of cases, suggesting that regulatory T cells may contribute to an enhancement of the immune response to the virus during disease progression, along with subsequent uncontrolled immune damage in patients with h7n9 infection.",PMC5377520,PMC5377520_1
"The study found that during the progression stage, CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells, CD8+PD-1+ T cells, CD4+IL-4+ T cells, CD4+PD-1+ T cells, Tregs, and Th17 cells all demonstrated an increase in all patients, with higher levels of CD8+PD-1+ T cells and CD4+IL-4+ T cells, which might induce the inhibition of Th1 cell-mediated antiviral immunity.",PMC5377520,PMC5377520_2
"The study found that during recovery, the frequency of Th17 cells was significantly higher than that in the progression stage, indicating that Th17 cells promote pathogenesis of the disease.",PMC5377520,PMC5377520_3
"The study found that during the progression stage, the frequency of CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, and B cells demonstrated an imbalance of CD4/CD8 in the progression stage, with a continuous reduction in CD4+T cells and B cells. This could indicate that the disease progression may be attributed to inhibition of the antiviral immune response of T cells, thereby causing the CD4/CD8 ratio to balance during recovery, and a downregulation of B cell-induced humoral immune responses against h7n9 virus.",PMC5377520,PMC5377520_4
