"The study identified 15 cases with probable or suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated with the initial outbreak at York Central Hospital in Toronto, Canada. Of these, 11 were admitted to the dedicated SARS treatment unit, and no additional cases were identified in the 10 days following the hospital-wide quarantine period. The study highlights the effectiveness of respiratory isolation and barrier precautions in controlling the spread of SARS in the hospital setting.",PMC155957,PMC155957_0
"The study found that in only 1 of the 15 cases, there was no identifiable period of close contact with a probable SARS patient. The vast majority of cases had clearly identifiable direct personal contact with a symptomatic probable SARS patient. This suggests that many of the treatments commonly used in the acute management of respiratory disease may have facilitated the transmission of the SARS coronavirus.",PMC155957,PMC155957_1
"The study notes that the initial public health response to the SARS outbreak involved the mass voluntary quarantine of over 5000 people, including hospital staff, physicians, students, volunteers, patients, and visitors. This disrupted the community's ability to access acute medical care services and highlights the urgent need for a rapid laboratory test to identify illness caused by the SARS coronavirus.",PMC155957,PMC155957_2
"The study notes that the use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and nebulized medications should be avoided in SARS patients, as these treatments may facilitate transmission of the SARS coronavirus.",PMC155957,PMC155957_3
"The study found that hospital workers remain at considerable risk of contracting SARS when there is an opportunity for unprotected exposure, and that further study of the utility of mass voluntary quarantine measures in the management of future SARS outbreaks is warranted.",PMC155957,PMC155957_4
