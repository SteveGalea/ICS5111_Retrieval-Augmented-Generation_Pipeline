"The study identified year-round prevalence of parainfluenza virus type 4 (HPIV-4) with peaks in the autumn of odd-numbered years, which is consistent with global epidemiologic data.",PMC3923541,PMC3923541_0
"Among the four HPIV types, patients with HPIV-4 had clinical presentation and severity most closely resembling those of HPIV-3 infections, but HPIV-4 was the only type not associated with croup.",PMC3923541,PMC3923541_1
"HPIV-4, along with HPIV-3, was associated with hypoxia, lower respiratory tract infections, abnormal radiographic findings, abnormal lung findings, and neurologic presentation, but the numbers were low due to the large number of samples with coinfections.",PMC3923541,PMC3923541_2
"HPIV-1, which was most commonly associated with croup, presented with the least severe clinical disease, as evidenced by the lowest likelihood of requiring hospital admission, ICU admission, having a chest X-ray obtained, or being prescribed antibiotics.",PMC3923541,PMC3923541_3
"Antibiotic use was high (27%-72%) among all HPIV types, but the study did not necessarily reflect the overall burden of HPIV respiratory disease in the general pediatric population due to selection bias toward children with increased severity of symptoms.",PMC3923541,PMC3923541_4
