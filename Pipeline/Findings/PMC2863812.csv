This study demonstrated that low-ph conditions can induce baculovirus (BV) of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (ACV) to enter SF9 insect cells by direct fusion with the cell surface. This finding is significant as it suggests that BV can infect SF9 cells through an endocytosis-independent pathway.,PMC2863812,PMC2863812_0
The study revealed that the infection via direct membrane fusion induced by low pH is myosin-like protein dependent and microtubule independent. This finding challenges the conventional understanding that BV infection in mammalian cells is mediated by the myosin-like proteins and microtubules.,PMC2863812,PMC2863812_1
"The study showed that after fusion with the cell membrane, the myosin-like proteins aid the transport of the nucleocapsids to the nucleus while intact microtubules are not necessary for this process. This finding challenges the conventional understanding that BV infection in mammalian cells is mediated by the microtubules.",PMC2863812,PMC2863812_2
"The study found that when the entry pathway was modified with the low-ph trigger, BV of ACMNPV could infect both hepg2 and Hela cells with a significantly improved transduction rate, even in the presence of nh4cl. This finding suggests that the low-ph trigger could improve the transduction rate of BV in other mammalian cells, making it easier to transduce mammalian cells and potentially expand the transduction range.",PMC2863812,PMC2863812_3
"The study showed that the nonenveloped nucleocapsids were microinjected into hepg2 cells, and at 6 h p.i., the stained nucleocapsids were observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating that the modifications of the nucleocapsids in the endosomes were not essential for BV infection in insect cells. This finding challenges the conventional understanding that BV infection in mammalian cells is mediated by the endosomal modification of the nucleocapsids.",PMC2863812,PMC2863812_4
