"The study reveals a previously uncharacterized functional domain in lmp1, called ctar3, which is critical for its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase ubc9.",PMC3196420,PMC3196420_0
"Deletion or overexpression of ctar3 inhibits the lmp1-ubc9 interaction, leading to decreased sumoylation of cellular proteins and reduced cell motility, respectively.",PMC3196420,PMC3196420_1
"The study demonstrates that lmp1 induces protein sumoylation, and this effect is lmp1-specific and not due to increased expression of ubc9.",PMC3196420,PMC3196420_2
"The study shows that approximately 80% less sumoylation of cellular proteins occurs when the lmp1-ubc9 interaction is inhibited, either by deletion of ctar3 or by overexpression of inactive ubc9.",PMC3196420,PMC3196420_3
The study suggests that lmp1-induced protein sumoylation may modulate signal transduction pathways induced by ctar1 and ctar2.,PMC3196420,PMC3196420_4
