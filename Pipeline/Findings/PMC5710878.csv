The study found that the diabetic model established in mice through feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) continuously for 24 weeks resulted in significant increases in body weight and fasting blood glucose levels compared to controls.,PMC5710878,PMC5710878_0
"The study also observed that mice fed an HFD for 24 weeks had significantly higher levels of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), in the serum compared to controls.",PMC5710878,PMC5710878_1
The study found that islets from diabetic mice showed significant increases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and total cellular ROS compared to islets from control mice.,PMC5710878,PMC5710878_2
"The study noted that islets from diabetic mice had significant decreases in mitochondrial content and function, as evidenced by decreased levels of mitochondrial fission protein (FIS1) and increased levels of mitochondrial fusion protein (OPA1) compared to islets from control mice.",PMC5710878,PMC5710878_3
The study observed that islets from diabetic mice had significant reductions in mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production compared to islets from control mice.,PMC5710878,PMC5710878_4
