The study describes the development of a rapid and sensitive method for the detection and identification of viruses in clinical specimens.,PMC1950496,PMC1950496_0
"The approach involves the use of multiplex PCR, template production, and sequencing to generate viral DNA templates for real-time PCR.",PMC1950496,PMC1950496_1
The method allows for the determination of viral molecules in viral templates and can provide up to 1000 viral DNA molecules per microliter.,PMC1950496,PMC1950496_2
The study also mentions the optimization of random multiplex PCR of RNA viruses and the involvement of multiple authors in the project's execution and approval.,PMC1950496,PMC1950496_3
