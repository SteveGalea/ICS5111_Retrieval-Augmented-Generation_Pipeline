"The study found that for pandemics with characteristics similar to those observed in previous pandemics, antiviral treatments for 20% to 25% of the population are likely to be sufficient to treat all patients.",PMC3371825,PMC3371825_0
The size of the antiviral stockpile required to treat all patients will depend on the clinical attack rate of the pandemic and the r0 value.,PMC3371825,PMC3371825_1
"For smaller antiviral stockpile sizes, substantial reductions in hospitalizations can be achieved through targeting treatment, with treating at-risk groups being the most effective strategy.",PMC3371825,PMC3371825_2
"Treating the working population may have benefits beyond reducing hospitalizations, but it consistently fails to be the best strategy for reducing hospitalizations, especially for smaller antiviral stockpile sizes.",PMC3371825,PMC3371825_3
"Further studies regarding the effects of antiviral treatments would improve the robustness of the parameter estimates, particularly on the reduction in the infectious period and antiviral resistance, and the issue of antiviral resistance needs to be resolved since it could compromise ni effectiveness.",PMC3371825,PMC3371825_4
