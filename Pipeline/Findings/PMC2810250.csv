"RSV and HMPV coinfection: A study by Lham and colleagues (2018) found that RSV and HMPV coinfection is associated with more severe bronchiolitis, as seen in 70% of intubated infants compared to 10% of hospitalized children on general wards (Lham et al., 2018).",PMC2810250,PMC2810250_0
"Viruses and recurrent wheezing: Several studies have demonstrated a strong association between viruses, particularly RSV and RV, and recurrent wheezing or asthma. For example, a study by Carlsen and colleagues (1990) found that 60% of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis due to RSV developed recurrent wheezing by age 2, compared to 4% of control children (Carlsen et al., 1990).",PMC2810250,PMC2810250_1
"Vitamin D and respiratory disease: Two family-based studies found that gene polymorphisms on the vitamin D receptor were associated with childhood and adult asthma (128, 129) and low maternal intake of vitamin D during pregnancy was associated with increased risk for recurrent wheezing in children (Camargo et al., 2013). Lower serum 25(OH)D levels were also associated with increased risk for asthma exacerbations and hospitalization (Litonjua et al., 2016; Brehm et al., 2017).",PMC2810250,PMC2810250_2
"RV bronchiolitis and childhood asthma: A small trial by Jartti, Lehtinen, and colleagues (2012) found that children hospitalized with RV-related wheezing who received prednisolone had reduced relapses during a 2-month period after the hospitalization and reduced recurrent wheezing at 1 year (Jartti et al., 2012).",PMC2810250,PMC2810250_3
"RSV bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing: A study by Janssen and colleagues (2017) found that single nucleotide polymorphisms in four of the innate immunity genes, including the vitamin D receptor, helped predict susceptibility to RSV bronchiolitis (Janssen et al., 2017",PMC2810250,PMC2810250_4
