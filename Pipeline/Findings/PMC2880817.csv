"Advancements in molecular diagnostic tools have led to the identification of over 200 distinct strains of human rhinovirus (HRV), the main cause of common colds and a major trigger of asthma exacerbations. One newly discovered HRV strain, HRV-C, has been associated with asthma onset and exacerbations in both children and adults.",PMC2880817,PMC2880817_0
"The use of molecular diagnostic tools has also revealed that HRV infections are more prevalent in infants than previously thought, with up to 90% of infants experiencing at least one HRV infection by age 1. HRV-C is particularly common in infants, with up to 90% of infants experiencing at least one HRV-C infection by age 1.",PMC2880817,PMC2880817_1
"HRV-C infections in early childhood have been associated with asthma onset and exacerbations, and this suggests that HRV-C may be a ""asthmagenic"" virus strain.",PMC2880817,PMC2880817_2
"Host factors, such as lower lung volumes at birth, particularly in those born prematurely, and genetic factors, may increase susceptibility to HRV-C infections and asthma exacerbations.",PMC2880817,PMC2880817_3
"Environmental factors, such as exposure to allergens and air pollution, may also interact with HRV-C infections and increase the risk of asthma exacerbations.",PMC2880817,PMC2880817_4
"Preventative and therapeutic interventions, such as inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene antagonists, can reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations by 40% to 50%. However, the mechanism for this reduction in risk is not fully understood, and further exploration is needed.",PMC2880817,PMC2880817_5
"Studies of differentiated human epithelium or organ culture of lung or sinus tissue may provide important insights into the mechanisms that link respiratory allergies to virus-induced wheezing and asthma, as well as into the role of host factors and environmental and lifestyle factors in these processes.",PMC2880817,PMC2880817_6
"Continued advances in microarray technology, genome-wide association studies, systems biology, and other high-throughput technologies provide important avenues for future investigations into the complex interplay of host, viral, developmental, and environmental factors in respiratory tract infections",PMC2880817,PMC2880817_7
