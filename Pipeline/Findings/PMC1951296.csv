"Construction of S mutant proteins revealed that mutations in the GxxxG motif did not significantly affect oligomerization or function of the S protein, as shown by pulse-chase experiments, western blot analysis, and viral entry assays.",PMC1951296,PMC1951296_0
"Mutations in the GxxxG motif did not affect the stability of S trimers or the ratio of S monomer to trimer in cells or pseudotyped particles, suggesting that the GxxxG motif is not essential for S incorporation.",PMC1951296,PMC1951296_1
"Mutations in the GxxxG motif did not affect the oligomerization behavior of S in cells or pseudotyped particles, as shown by non-reducing gel analysis of immunoprecipitated S proteins.",PMC1951296,PMC1951296_2
"However, mutations in the GxxxG motif, particularly at position 1205, did affect the entry-mediating capacity of S, as shown by decreased infectivity of SarsPP containing the mutant S protein.",PMC1951296,PMC1951296_3
"The GxxxG motif may not be essential for the cell-cell fusion-mediating capacity of S, as shown by similar fusion activity of mutant S proteins compared to wild-type S. This suggests that the requirements for membrane fusion pore formation may be different for S and other viral envelope proteins, such as the VSV-G protein.",PMC1951296,PMC1951296_4
