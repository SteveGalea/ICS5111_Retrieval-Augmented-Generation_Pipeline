"In the context of vaccine design, the use of tetrameric antigens for flow cytometry and magnetic enrichment strategies have greatly improved the sensitivity and specificity of identifying antigen-specific b cells, allowing for the characterization of rare na√Øve, memory, and plasmablast populations (20, 26, 80, 83).",PMC6667631,PMC6667631_0
"In the context of infectious diseases, antigen-specific b cells have been identified using fluorescence-conjugated tetramers, followed by magnetic enrichment and flow cytometry, to better understand the humoral immune response during infection (2, 62, 63, 70).",PMC6667631,PMC6667631_1
"In the context of autoimmune diseases, adoptively transferred b cells have been distinguished from recipient lymphocytes using allelic variations in cd45 or mice devoid of b cells, allowing for the analysis of antigen-specific b cells in vivo (table 2).",PMC6667631,PMC6667631_2
"In the context of infectious diseases, antigens from pathogens have been labeled using fluorescent tags to allow for direct visualization of antigen-specific b cells using microscopy (2, 62, 65).",PMC6667631,PMC6667631_3
"In the context of vaccine design, mass cytometry with heavy metal-labeled tetramers has the potential to provide further high-dimensional analysis of antigen-specific b cells, with the ability to simultaneously measure up to 42 unique parameters from a single sample without significant spillover between channels (73, 74).",PMC6667631,PMC6667631_4
