"In the study, a new HCMV strain, AD169, was identified and found to encode a novel viral protein, ul50, which is a nuclear protein required for efficient viral replication in human fibroblast cells.",PMC6052311,PMC6052311_0
"Ul50 was found to be a host cell factor required for efficient viral replication in human fibroblast cells, as its depletion resulted in a significant reduction in viral replication.",PMC6052311,PMC6052311_1
"Ul50 was also found to interact with the HCMV-encoded viral protein, pp65, which is a major viral protein involved in viral replication and DNA synthesis.",PMC6052311,PMC6052311_2
"The study also revealed that ul50 is a substrate for the cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF170, and its ubiquitination is required for efficient viral replication in human fibroblast cells.",PMC6052311,PMC6052311_3
"Furthermore, the study showed that ul50 interacts with the cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF170, through its C-terminal domain, and this interaction is required for efficient viral replication in human fibroblast cells.",PMC6052311,PMC6052311_4
