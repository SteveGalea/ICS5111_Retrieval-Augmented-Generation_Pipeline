"The study utilized massively parallel pyrosequencing to obtain a global transcriptome analysis of Sogatella furcifera-infected brown planthoppers (BP) and their uninfected counterparts. This approach identified 81,854 unigenes larger than 350 bp, and the results were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database.",PMC3338671,PMC3338671_0
"The study found that 61.3% of the unigenes had significant similarity with known genes, and 32.1% of the unigenes had similarity with genes from the non-redundant (NR) NCBI database. The study also identified 1,317 differentially expressed genes between viruliferous and non-viruliferous BP samples, which were used for GO enrichment analyses.",PMC3338671,PMC3338671_1
"The study used a rigorous algorithm to identify differentially expressed genes between the viruliferous and non-viruliferous BP samples, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.001 and an absolute value of the log2 ratio greater than 1 providing thresholds for significant differences in gene expression.",PMC3338671,PMC3338671_2
"The study found that genes involved in primary metabolism, ubiquitin-proteasome, cytoskeleton dynamics, and immune responses were upregulated in viruliferous BP.",PMC3338671,PMC3338671_3
"The study used qRT-PCR to verify the results of the pyrosequencing analysis for 42 randomly selected genes and found that the average threshold cycle (CT) was calculated per sample, with an endogenous 18S rRNA gene of BP used for normalization.",PMC3338671,PMC3338671_4
