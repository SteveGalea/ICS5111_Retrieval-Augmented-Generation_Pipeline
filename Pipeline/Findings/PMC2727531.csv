"In this study in Nepal, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common agent isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirates in children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), occurring with significant temporal variation.",PMC2727531,PMC2727531_0
"RSV infections were detected in 40% of children with CAP in this study, indicating that RSV plays an important role in this common childhood illness in Nepal.",PMC2727531,PMC2727531_1
"The study found that RSV infections occurred with considerable temporal variation, highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures in resource-poor settings.",PMC2727531,PMC2727531_2
"The study also detected other respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV), in children with CAP.",PMC2727531,PMC2727531_3
"The study found that the occurrence of viral CAP in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro-epidemics with several respiratory viruses, indicating that respiratory viruses play an important role in this common childhood illness in Nepal.",PMC2727531,PMC2727531_4
