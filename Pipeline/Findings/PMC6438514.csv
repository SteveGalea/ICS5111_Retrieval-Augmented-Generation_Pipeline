"Sulfonated poly(allylamine)-based polymers, specifically Î¹-carrageenan and nspah-15-94, demonstrate a dose-dependent inhibition of human metapneumovirus (hmpv) replication with comparable antiviral properties to carrageenans, but with better physicochemical properties.",PMC6438514,PMC6438514_0
Studies on the mechanism of antiviral properties of these polymers suggest that the decrease in infectivity is due to blocking virus release from cellular membranes.,PMC6438514,PMC6438514_1
These developed synthetic polymers are not toxic and offer similar antiviral properties as carrageenans but show better physicochemical properties.,PMC6438514,PMC6438514_2
"In a previous work, nspahs were reported to hamper influenza virus replication in vitro and in vivo and are believed to be broad-spectrum drug candidates competitive to marketed compounds.",PMC6438514,PMC6438514_3
"The authors suggest that further studies on the mechanism of antiviral properties of these polymers may reveal that the difference in nspahs activity between hmpv and human coronavirus nl63 results from different requirements for the presence of host shutoff protein (hsp) s, but it would not explain strong inhibitory effect of nspahs against the influenza virus.",PMC6438514,PMC6438514_4
