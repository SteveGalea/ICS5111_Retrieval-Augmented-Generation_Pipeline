"InfraRed Thermography (IRT) is a non-invasive technique that allows for the visualization and quantification of infrared radiation, providing information on temperature ranges of observed objects.",PMC5380771,PMC5380771_0
"IRT can help detect Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) by revealing thermal abnormalities in affected fingers, with a temperature difference of 2.2Â°C between fingers and hands being indicative of RP.",PMC5380771,PMC5380771_1
"IRT can also distinguish primary RP from secondary RP, as the former shows symmetrical finger rewarming after a heat challenge, while the latter only shows partial rewarming due to irreversible, structural vessel damage.",PMC5380771,PMC5380771_2
"IRT can be used to determine the status and nature of digital ulcers (DUs) in systemic sclerosis (SSc) by revealing a focal temperature increase in the affected area, indicating active inflammation or a 'cold spot' indicating ischemia and possible necrosis.",PMC5380771,PMC5380771_3
"IRT can evaluate treatment response in SSc, such as the effectiveness of vasodilatory agents, emergency treatment for critical digital ischemia, and persistent temperature gradients between fingers and hands as an independent indicator of disease severity.",PMC5380771,PMC5380771_4
