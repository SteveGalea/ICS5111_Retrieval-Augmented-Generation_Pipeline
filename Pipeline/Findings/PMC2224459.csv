"The study identifies mutations in the viral RNA polymerase (3Dpol) of the enterovirus cvb3, which confer resistance to the nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors amiloride and eipa.",PMC2224459,PMC2224459_0
"The study shows that amiloride-resistant cvb3 isolates have mutations in either the s299t or the a372v position in 3Dpol, or a combination of both mutations and a d48g mutation in the 2A protein, which confers resistance to both amiloride and eipa.",PMC2224459,PMC2224459_1
"The study finds that the mutations have different effects on resistance to amiloride in multiple replication cycles or in a single replication cycle, suggesting potential synergistic effects of both mutations in a single replication cycle for the combination of a372v and d48g mutations.",PMC2224459,PMC2224459_2
"The study demonstrates that amiloride-resistant cvb3 isolates have mutations close to the active center of cvb3 polymerase, indicating that amiloride and eipa may act as nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors, a novel mechanism of activity for these compounds.",PMC2224459,PMC2224459_3
"The study suggests that the location of mutations conferring cvb3 resistance to amiloride and eipa, close to the active center of cvb3 polymerase, may reflect differences in the mechanism of picornavirus release, as the effects of eipa on cvb3 and human rhinovirus release observed in the study may reflect differences in their release mechanisms.",PMC2224459,PMC2224459_4
