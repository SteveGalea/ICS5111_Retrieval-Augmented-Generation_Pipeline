"In a study on human monoclonal antibody production, 33 HIV-1 infected drug naive patients were recruited. The study design and antibody screening were carried out by RA and KL, while RP, SS, AN, and PK provided technical support. The support extended by DBT (Bt/Pr 10511/Med/29/66/2008) and ICMR (61/7/2008-bms) for funding this work is acknowledged.",PMC3493341,PMC3493341_0
"In the study, pseudovirus-containing culture supernatants were harvested 48 hours post transfection filtered (0.45 μm pore size) and stored at -80°C in 1 ml aliquots. A 96-well plate was coated overnight with protein or peptide at 1.0 μg/ml, and then anti-V3 human mAbs at a saturating level of 10 μg/ml were added for 1.5 h incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2. Freshly trypsinized Tzm-bl cells (10,000 cells in 100 μl of growth medium containing dextran and protease inhibitor indianavir (in case of primary isolates only) were added to each well of the mAb/virus mixtures in duplicates.",PMC3493341,PMC3493341_1
"In the study, a set of control wells received cells plus pseudovirus (virus control) and another set received cells only (background control). After 48 hours of incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2, luciferase activity was measured by using the Bright-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega Inc.).",PMC3493341,PMC3493341_2
"In a study on human monoclonal antibody production, pseudotyped viruses were produced by co-transfection of the REV/ENV expression plasmid and an ENV-deficient HIV-1 backbone vector (psg3δenv) into exponentially dividing 293T cells (atcc; catalog no. 11268), in 6-well tissue culture plates (corning inc).",PMC3493341,PMC3493341_3
