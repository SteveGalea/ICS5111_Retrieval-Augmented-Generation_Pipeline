"A review by Hemila et al. (2013) found that therapeutic doses of vitamin C (0.2g/day or more) can shorten the duration of the common cold, but with no statistical significance due to heterogeneity related to sex and dosage. However, studies by Elwood PC and Tyrrell DA indicated that mere therapeutic doses of vitamin C are effective in men rather than women, reducing the main duration, nasal congestion or running nose, and limb and muscle pain.",PMC6057395,PMC6057395_0
"Vitamin C is the most effective water-soluble antioxidant in human plasma, concentrated in leukocytes, and its concentration rapidly declines during infections and stress. Vitamin C supplementation improves the ability to resist infection by improving the activities of the immune system, such as antimicrobial and natural killer cell activities, lymphocyte proliferation, chemotaxis, and delayed-type hypersensitivity. It also contributes to hormone regulation, including activation of the sympathetic nervous system and secretion of epinephrine during abnormal stress.",PMC6057395,PMC6057395_1
"The combination of supplemental and therapeutic doses of vitamin C is capable of relieving chest pain, fever, and chills, as well as shortening the time of confinement indoors and mean duration. Data availability: All data are contained within the paper.",PMC6057395,PMC6057395_2
"A large dose of vitamin C during the common cold, usually 3.0g/day to 4.0g/day, can better recover health, while administration of extra doses of vitamin C at the onset of a common cold can help reduce the duration by about half a day, shorten the time confined indoors by about 10 hours, and relieve symptoms of a common cold, including chest pain, fever, and chills.",PMC6057395,PMC6057395_3
"Language limitations weakened the exactness and representativeness of the study's data, as in some cases, the data had to be calculated and transformed rather than being available directly. Therapeutic RCTs must be conducted according to stricter, more precise guidelines to gain more knowledge on this subject. Conflicts of interest: The authors declare no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.",PMC6057395,PMC6057395_4
