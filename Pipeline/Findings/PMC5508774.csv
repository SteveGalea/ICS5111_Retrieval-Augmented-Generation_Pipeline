"Case patient, a lung transplant recipient with multiple sclerosis, presented with fevers, headache, and encephalopathy, which were attributed to tacrolimus toxicity and hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection.",PMC5508774,PMC5508774_0
"HEV infection, which can cause chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, is infrequently considered as an infectious cause of meningoencephalitis and specific diagnostic testing is not routinely done, especially in immunosuppressed patients.",PMC5508774,PMC5508774_1
"The patient's symptoms and lymphocytic pleocytosis on admission were consistent with acute viral meningitis, but tacrolimus toxicity may have also contributed to her presentation.",PMC5508774,PMC5508774_2
"HEV infection, which can cause neurologic manifestations including inflammatory polyradiculopathy, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, has been seen in 5.5% of cases in immunosuppressed patients.",PMC5508774,PMC5508774_3
The patient's persistent low-level transaminase elevations for several years before admission and subsequent evidence of cirrhosis suggest that she was likely chronically infected with HEV.,PMC5508774,PMC5508774_4
