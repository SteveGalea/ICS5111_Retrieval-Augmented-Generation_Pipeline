"Second-generation sequencing (sg) technology has revolutionized the diagnosis of rare and rare pulmonary infectious diseases by providing rapid, accurate, and independent culture-based identification of bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens, as well as their antimicrobial sensitivity characteristics. However, the sensitivity of common pathogens, such as cryptococcus, is not stronger than traditional methods, and direct sg testing of clinical specimens to diagnose m. Tuberculosis infection is very difficult due to the limitations of sg technology.",PMC7060411,PMC7060411_0
"The application of sgs detection in hereditary diseases is more advantageous than in the diagnosis and treatment of complex pulmonary infectious diseases because sgs can theoretically detect almost all pathogenic microorganisms, while traditional methods cannot be ignored, and other effective pathogen detection methods should be retained or explored as supplements or verifications.",PMC7060411,PMC7060411_1
"The core of sgs testing for the diagnosis of lung infections is the identification of responsible pathogens, and the excessive expectation and interpretation of sgs detection results can not only push up the cost of clinical testing but also make it effective. The examination could not be carried out smoothly, which also led to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Therefore, the use of the deep reinforcement learning, based on the patient's medical history and clinical examination, the possible pathogens are presumed, the specimens are preprocessed and then sequenced, and even different strategies are adopted for the biosignal analysis of the sequencing results.",PMC7060411,PMC7060411_2
"The deep reinforcement learning model is a promising direction for sgs in the application of pulmonary infectious diseases because it sets certain standards and procedures to determine whether the detected pathogen is a responsible pathogen, and designing targeted evaluation sequencing methods based on different types of pathogens to improve the effectiveness of sgs.",PMC7060411,PMC7060411_3
"The current sgs testing cost is still high, and it cannot be widely used in the clinic. Therefore, using the deep reinforcement learning combined with knowledge graph is a promising direction for sgs in the application of pulmonary infectious diseases because it can eliminate the valueless results and analyze and evaluate the meaningful results of sgs, and it can also improve the effectiveness of sgs by reducing errors, improving the detection rate of specific pathogens, and improving the interpretation of",PMC7060411,PMC7060411_4
