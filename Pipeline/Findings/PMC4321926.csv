"In patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there is dysfunction of the innate immune responses, as evidenced by the downregulation of interferon (IFN)-related genes and the suppression of Jak/STAT signaling pathway in the acute severe phase compared to the healthy control or convalescent phase.",PMC4321926,PMC4321926_0
"The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, is highly expressed in the acute severe phase, while anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 receptors, are strikingly downregulated.",PMC4321926,PMC4321926_1
"Chemokines, including RANTES, CXCL10, and CXCL11, are downregulated in the acute severe phase, while inflammatory chemokines, such as Gro-1, CXCL1, and IL-8 and their receptors, are significantly upregulated.",PMC4321926,PMC4321926_2
"In the acute severe phase, the expression profiles of chemokines and neutrophil predominance in white cells reflect rampant inflammation, and the poor expression of IFN-stimulated genes, TLR3, 7, and immune cell activation markers (CD antigens and MHC molecules) may mirror the defect of host antiviral immunity.",PMC4321926,PMC4321926_3
"The activation of some pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways, such as IL-1, IL-6, or IL-8, may interfere with the IFN signaling pathway, but direct interaction between coronavirus and the IFN system cannot be excluded. The overexpression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to acute lung injury and imbalance of homeostasis, especially in the acute severe phase.",PMC4321926,PMC4321926_4
