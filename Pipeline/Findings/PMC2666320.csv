"TSA, a biomarker commonly used in humans to monitor feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection, can be easily detected in feline serum using a spectrophotometric method.",PMC2666320,PMC2666320_0
"The method is precise and accurate at TSA values commonly encountered in feline blood, but not at low TSA values due to high inter-assay variability.",PMC2666320,PMC2666320_1
"TSA levels are increased in cats with neoplastic and inflammatory diseases, confirming results reported in species other than felines.",PMC2666320,PMC2666320_2
"TSA cannot be used to support a diagnosis of inflammation or of FCoV infection, except in the case of very high results or in cats where the pre-test probability of FCoV infection is very high.",PMC2666320,PMC2666320_3
"The rate of FCoV infection was low in cats with high TSA and vice versa, supporting the hypothesis that TSA can have a role in resistance to FCoV infection.",PMC2666320,PMC2666320_4
