"Prevalence: out of 260 canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) isolates from Vietnam, 6 (2.31%) were CPV-2a, 251 (96.54%) were CPV-2c, and 3 (1.15%) were untypable.",PMC6486976,PMC6486976_0
"Regional variation: in Northern Vietnam, 3 (2.97%) were CPV-2a and 98 (97.3%) were CPV-2c. In Central Vietnam, 1 (1.11%) was CPV-2a and 89 (98.89%) were CPV-2c. In Southern Vietnam, 2 (3.03%) were CPV-2a and 64 (96.97%) were CPV-2c.",PMC6486976,PMC6486976_1
Absence of CPV-2b: CPV-2b was not observed in this study.,PMC6486976,PMC6486976_2
Phylogenetic analysis: the recent Vietnamese CPV-2c isolates share a common evolutionary origin with Asian CPV-2c strains.,PMC6486976,PMC6486976_3
Similarity to prototype CPV-2c strains: the VP2 genes of CPV-2c in Vietnam are more genetically similar to those of CPV-2c strains in China and Taiwan than to those of prototype CPV-2c strains (FJ222821) or the first Vietnamese CPV-2c (AB120727).,PMC6486976,PMC6486976_4
