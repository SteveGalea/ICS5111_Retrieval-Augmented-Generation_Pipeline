"The study found that fgfr1 silencing by siRNA significantly increased iav replication, while lentivirus-mediated fgfr1 overexpression effectively reduced iav replication, indicating that fgfr1 plays a suppressive role in iav pr8 and h5n1 replication.",PMC4409105,PMC4409105_0
"The study showed that fgfr1 knockdown notably elevated virus entry efficiency during the early stages of iav infection, and further demonstrated that fgfr1 could inhibit virus internalization, which indicated that host cells may have evolved a specific strategy of utilizing plasma membrane as a barrier to block influenza virus entry.",PMC4409105,PMC4409105_1
"The study found that both fgfr1 protein expression and kinase phosphorylation levels were downregulated by iav infection, which may be related to the pathogenesis of influenza virus-induced disease.",PMC4409105,PMC4409105_2
"The study revealed that the inhibition of fgfr1 phosphorylation with a selective inhibitor pd173074 enhanced iav replication, indicating that fgfr1 suppressed iav replication probably by inhibiting viral internalization, but it remains unclear whether fgfr1 was implicated in other steps of the iav life cycle.",PMC4409105,PMC4409105_3
"The study showed that fgfr4 knockdown had no significant effect on inhibiting pr8 and h5n1 virus replication, while fgfr1 not fgfr4 remarkably suppressed pr8 and h5n1 virus replication, suggesting that fgfr1, not fgfr4, plays a role in inhibiting iav replication.",PMC4409105,PMC4409105_4
