"The study identified distinct immune signatures linked to specific viral and bacterial pathogens in symptomatic children, which can help elucidate factors contributing to ari in pediatric patients.",PMC6238668,PMC6238668_0
The study revealed that interferon-gamma (ifnl3) and its downstream signaling pathway play a protective role in the ongoing antiviral immune response in the nasal mucosa during ari in pediatric patients.,PMC6238668,PMC6238668_1
"The study identified a group of genes at the intersection of the immune response to the presence of microbial loads and clinical symptoms, which may act as markers of the immune response at the nasopharyngeal interface in children with ari.",PMC6238668,PMC6238668_2
"The study found that marco, a scavenger receptor expressed in tissue-resident macrophages, recognizes various bacterial pathogens and can enhance adenovirus infection in children with ari.",PMC6238668,PMC6238668_3
