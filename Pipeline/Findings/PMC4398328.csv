"In a study of 7 non-immunocompromised adult patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by human adenovirus (hAdV) infection, early administration of the antiviral drug cidofovir was associated with favorable outcomes, including complete radiographic resolution and full recovery without complications.",PMC4398328,PMC4398328_0
"All 7 patients received cidofovir within 72 hours of diagnosis of hAdV infection, and the median time to identification of hAdV infection was 2 days.",PMC4398328,PMC4398328_1
"In contrast, in previous studies, most patients with severe hAdV pneumonia did not receive antiviral therapy, and half of the patients died despite receiving appropriate respiratory support and antiviral therapy.",PMC4398328,PMC4398328_2
"The study population was not representative of the general population in terms of age or gender, as it was conducted at a military hospital.",PMC4398328,PMC4398328_3
"Human hAdV-55, a major pneumonia pathogen in the general population, was identified as the causative agent in all 7 patients. However, the possible influences of bacterial or other co-infection on treatment outcomes cannot be excluded, as extensive microbiological testing was conducted.",PMC4398328,PMC4398328_4
