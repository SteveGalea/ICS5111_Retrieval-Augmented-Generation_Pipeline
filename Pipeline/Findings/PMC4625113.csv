"A study optimized an indirect ELISA for detecting antibodies against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in fecal and serum samples. The assay utilized a spike protein antigen derived from a PEDV genogroup 2 strain, which can be applied to antigens from other PEDV strains. The method was validated using 69 paired samples from pigs with known PEDV exposure, and cut-off values for positivity were determined based on the mean s/p ratios of PEDV-negative samples plus three standard deviations. The assay showed a significant positive correlation between fecal and serum anti-PEDV IgG levels.",PMC4625113,PMC4625113_0
"The study found that background PEDV infection is widespread in pig populations, with most PEDV strains belonging to genogroup 1 prior to 2010, and more recent outbreaks associated with PEDV genogroup 2.",PMC4625113,PMC4625113_1
"The study highlights the importance of accurate and timely diagnosis of PEDV infection, as PEDV causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in pigs of any age with often high mortality in neonatal piglets, and recent outbreaks have been reported in Europe, North America, and South America.",PMC4625113,PMC4625113_2
"The study emphasizes that due to the similarities in clinical signs with other enteric pathogens, measurement of localized IgG immune responses is critical to evaluate protection, as detection of these antibodies only indicates that individuals had previous contact with infectious microorganisms, or were vaccinated.",PMC4625113,PMC4625113_3
"The study suggests that testing fecal samples or oral fluids for assessing local PEDV immunity in pig herds is feasible, as a good correlation was found between the levels of PEDV IgG antibodies in serum and fecal samples, and future studies should also assess oral fluid samples for suitability as a sample type to assess herd immunity.",PMC4625113,PMC4625113_4
