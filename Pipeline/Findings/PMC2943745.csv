"The study found that the low-production il-6 -174 cytokine phenotype, characterized by the c/c genotype, was associated with a greater expression of symptoms and complications during rhinovirus infection in adults.",PMC2943745,PMC2943745_0
The study also identified the ifn-γ +874 cytokine phenotype as a predictor of lower seroconversion rates during rv39 infection.,PMC2943745,PMC2943745_1
The study showed a positive correlation between the number of cold days and the log concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in nasal secretions.,PMC2943745,PMC2943745_2
The study found that the low-production IL-6 -174 phenotype predicted greater symptom scores in most symptom domains during rv39 infection in adults.,PMC2943745,PMC2943745_3
"The study demonstrated a significant effect of the IFN-γ +874 cytokine phenotype on the frequency of seroconversion during rv39 infection in adults, with its phenotype being an inverse predictor of the rate of seroconversion.",PMC2943745,PMC2943745_4
