"The authors present evidence that mutations at the s1/s2 site in the spike protein of feline coronavirus (FCoV) are linked to the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in cats. They found that 10 of 11 cats harboring FCoV that subsequently developed FIP had mutations at the s1/s2 site, and in most cases, these mutations were unique to individual cats.",PMC3713968,PMC3713968_0
"The authors suggest that mutations in the s1/s2 site lead to a switch in the activating protease for FCoV, as the mutations are incompatible with the furin cleavage site, which is typical of FCoV in asymptomatic cats. They also found that some mutations negatively affect furin processing, while others enhance it.",PMC3713968,PMC3713968_1
"The authors propose that the mutations in the s1/s2 region affect the heparin sulfate binding site in this region, which is a cell culture adaptation of the virus. However, they suggest that this binding site is unlikely to be relevant to the clinical situation due to the fact that it is a cell culture adaptation of the virus.",PMC3713968,PMC3713968_2
"The authors suggest that the mutations in the s1/s2 region lead to cleavability by monocytic/macrophage-specific proteases, such as pro-protein convertases, cathepsins, or other macrophage-specific proteases. They also suggest that these proteases recognize the hallmark residues remaining or acquired in FCoV s1/s2 cleavage site.",PMC3713968,PMC3713968_3
"The authors propose that a shift in the entry pathway to enable virus entry at the cell surface instead of the endosome may simultaneously explain the ability of FCoV to infect macrophages and the macrophage resistance of FCoV. They also suggest that matrix metalloprotease 9, which was demonstrated to be upregulated in activated monocytes and macrophages during FIP, may be involved in this process.",PMC3713968,PMC3713968_4
