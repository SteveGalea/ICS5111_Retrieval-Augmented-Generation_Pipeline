"In a study on the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (fmd) in the United States, the authors found that using random spatial locations to predict optimal control strategies, such as ring culling, still leads to a substantial improvement in epidemic impact, as long as the models are reparameterized to match the epidemic data. However, the optimal ring size predicted from random spatial locations is typically an overestimate of the true optimal radius, and using this overestimate still leads to a significant improvement in epidemic impact and is only slightly worse than using the true value optimized to account for spatial structure in the distribution of farms.",PMC2824282,PMC2824282_0
"The authors also found that when precise demographic data are unavailable, alternate methods need to be adopted for mathematical modelers to predict control of epidemics with spatially localized transmission. In the United States, where precise knowledge of farm location is unknown but aggregate farm statistics are available, this work provides an insight into the role that mathematical modeling can still play in informing disease control policy.",PMC2824282,PMC2824282_1
"The authors noted that when case report data are available in real time and parameterization is performed using state-of-the-art methodology, this work can provide rapid policy advice that could minimize potential losses, as it is likely that the approach can be used robustly in many situations, providing timely policy advice that could minimize potential losses, given the simplicity and parsimony of the approach.",PMC2824282,PMC2824282_2
"The authors also found that the effect of ring culling at the optimal radius rrr, based on a random-location model, is still a significant improvement in epidemic impact, even when the models using random spatial locations are reparameterized to match epidemics from real or surrogate sources. However, the optimal ring size predicted from random spatial locations is, in general, a slight overestimate of the true optimal radius, and using this overestimate still leads to a substantial improvement in epidemic impact and is only slightly worse than using the true value optimized to account for spatial structure in the distribution of farms.",PMC2824282,PMC2824282_3
"The authors concluded that recognizing that epidemics take place in a spatial landscape is vital, but once a model has been parameterized to match the epidemic data, much of the spatial structure is subsumed into the reparameterization. As such, aggregate data and aggregate case reports can be used to derive predictions for control of epidemics with spatially local",PMC2824282,PMC2824282_4
