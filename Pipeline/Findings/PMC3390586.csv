"The study identifies over 1,00 host proteins in herpesvirus particles, providing insight into the viral life cycle and host-pathogen interactions.",PMC3390586,PMC3390586_0
"The study reveals that herpesvirus particles contain a variety of cellular proteins involved in molecular transport, cytoskeletal organization, and protein synthesis.",PMC3390586,PMC3390586_1
The study suggests that some of these host proteins may be incorporated into herpesvirus particles to modulate their functions in favor of the virus.,PMC3390586,PMC3390586_2
"The study highlights the potential role of virion-associated host proteins in regulating apoptosis, which may provide a mean to quickly evade death upon entry and to efficiently release herpesviruses later on.",PMC3390586,PMC3390586_3
The study emphasizes the need for orthogonal validation of host proteins found in herpesvirus particles using biologically relevant assays to distinguish them from sticky contaminants and to sort biologically relevant cellular proteins from accessory virion-associated proteins.,PMC3390586,PMC3390586_4
