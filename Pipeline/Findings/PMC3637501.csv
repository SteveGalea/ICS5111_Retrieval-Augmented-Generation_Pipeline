"The study identified early changes in gene expression in patients treated with ipilimumab that may predict the incidence of later gi iraes. These changes include increased expression of neutrophil-activating cytokines such as il-8, increased expression of genes related to antibody production such as pseudomonas anti-i2 and saccharomyces cerevisiae, and increased expression of genes related to inflammation such as cxcl2 and cxcl3.",PMC3637501,PMC3637501_0
"The study found that high expression of the neutrophil-activating marker cd177 at week 3 was a very specific biomarker for grade 2+ gi iraes, as all patients who had no such event displayed expression levels below a certain threshold.",PMC3637501,PMC3637501_1
"The study also identified potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers such as increased expression of genes related to antibody production, increased expression of genes related to inflammation, and increased expression of genes related to neutrophil activation, which were present in patients who had later gi iraes.",PMC3637501,PMC3637501_2
"The study noted that the onset of gi iraes was associated with an increased number and expression of neutrophils, as well as increased expression of genes related to inflammation and antibody production.",PMC3637501,PMC3637501_3
"The study also highlighted the important role of neutrophils in the onset of gi iraes in these patients, as high expression of the neutrophil-activating marker cd177 at week 3 was a very specific biomarker for grade 2+ gi iraes, and increased expression of neutrophil-activating cytokines such as il-8 and increased expression of genes related to neutrophil activation were present in patients who had later gi iraes.",PMC3637501,PMC3637501_4
