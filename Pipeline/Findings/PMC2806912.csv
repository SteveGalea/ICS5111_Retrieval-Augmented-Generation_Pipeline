"The human lung has two main epithelial cell types: non-ciliated cells and ciliated cells. The former is more susceptible to human influenza virus infection, while the latter is more permissive to avian influenza virus infection.",PMC2806912,PMC2806912_0
"Influenza virus infection induces a complex set of innate host responses, including cytokine and chemokine release, which play a critical role in host defense and pathogenesis.",PMC2806912,PMC2806912_1
The distribution of sialic acid receptors on the cell surface of bronchial epithelial cells is a major determinant of the permissiveness of these cells to influenza virus infection.,PMC2806912,PMC2806912_2
"The human seasonal influenza virus (h3n2) preferentially infects non-ciliated cells, while the avian influenza virus (h5n1) infects ciliated cells. This differential tropism is associated with the localization of sialic acid receptors on these cell types.",PMC2806912,PMC2806912_3
The expression of sialic acid receptors on bronchial epithelial cells has a major impact on the permissiveness of these cells to influenza virus replication and on the host responses elicited by such infection. This highlights the importance of using physiologically relevant models for the understanding of influenza virus pathogenesis.,PMC2806912,PMC2806912_4
