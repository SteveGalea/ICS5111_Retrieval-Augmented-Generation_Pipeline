The study found that humans and apes share a common ancestor around 6 million years ago.,PMC2687769,PMC2687769_0
"Humans and apes share around 95% of their genes, but there are significant differences in the genes that control brain development and function.",PMC2687769,PMC2687769_1
"The study found that the human brain is larger and more complex than that of apes, and that this is due to changes in gene regulation rather than in the number of genes.",PMC2687769,PMC2687769_2
"The study also found that humans have a higher density of gray matter in the brain, which is associated with increased cognitive abilities.",PMC2687769,PMC2687769_3
"The study suggested that the evolution of language may have been a result of changes in gene regulation, as the regions of the brain involved in language are also areas with high gray matter density.",PMC2687769,PMC2687769_4
