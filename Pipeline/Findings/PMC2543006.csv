"In a study of 75 homes with cats in Britain, the authors calculated that smoking one pack of cigarettes daily contributed 20 μg/m3 to the 24-hour average indoor particle concentration [7]. In a modeling analysis, the authors found that with conventional filtration, the risk of infection with influenza was 61%, and with natural ventilation, it was 33.6%. With high efficiency in-duct air cleaning systems, the risk of infection with influenza was 16.5%.",PMC2543006,PMC2543006_0
"In a study of 100 homes with pets in the United States, the authors found that pet allergens, including cat allergens and dog allergens, were present in 96% of the homes [8]. In a modeling analysis, the authors found that with conventional filtration, the average concentration of cat allergen in a single room was 230 μg/m3, and with high efficiency in-duct air cleaning systems, it was 120 μg/m3.",PMC2543006,PMC2543006_1
