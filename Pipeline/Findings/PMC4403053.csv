Plga nanoparticles containing gla were successfully prepared with an appropriate size and zeta potential.,PMC4403053,PMC4403053_0
"The antimicrobial activity of gla loaded plga nanoparticles was better than that of free gla against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",PMC4403053,PMC4403053_1
The release profiles of gla from nanoparticle formulations followed a two-phase pattern: an initial burst release followed by a slower slow release phase.,PMC4403053,PMC4403053_2
The initial burst release level was dependent on the amount of plga polymer in nanoparticle samples.,PMC4403053,PMC4403053_3
"The release curves demonstrated that during the first 10 hours, an initial burst release led to an early release of 100%, 55%, and 29% of drug from pure gla, gla loaded nanoparticles with 1:1 and 1:3 drug to polymer ratio, respectively.",PMC4403053,PMC4403053_4
