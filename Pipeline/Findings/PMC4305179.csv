"The present study found that cerebral expression of the non-glutamic acid-leucine-arginine chemokine cxcl9 increases in an ifn-γ–dependent manner during reactivation of t. gondii infection, and that cxcl9 is crucial for recruiting immune cells into the brain and preventing tachyzoite growth and reactivation of cerebral infection with t. gondii.",PMC4305179,PMC4305179_0
"Cxcl9 is one of the three major chemokines expressed in the brains of chronically infected wild-type balb/c mice, and it is the most highly expressed among these three chemokines in their brains during cerebral infection with t. gondii.",PMC4305179,PMC4305179_1
The present study revealed that ifn-γ regulates t-cell infiltration into the brain by inducing an expression of both the adhesion molecule vcam-1 and the chemokine cxcl9 critical for the t-cell migration into the brain to prevent tachyzoite growth and reactivation of cerebral infection with t. gondii.,PMC4305179,PMC4305179_2
"The present study found that cxcl9 is important for mediating t-cell recruitment to the areas where tachyzoites begin proliferating to prevent reactivation of cerebral infection with t. gondii, and that cxcl9 plays a crucial role in host defense against infection with multiple types of intracellular microorganisms in the brain.",PMC4305179,PMC4305179_3
"In contrast to the observations in the present study on the importance of cxcl9 for host resistance against reactivation of cerebral infection with t. gondii, it was reported that there is no significant differences in mortality between cxcl9-deficient and wild-type c57bl/6 mice during acute primary infection with t. gondii, and that the role of cxcl9 in resistance to the parasite differs, depending on the stages of infection and likely depending on the organs.",PMC4305179,PMC4305179_4
