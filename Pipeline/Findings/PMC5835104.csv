"The study demonstrates that the chicken embryo is capable of producing a robust signature of the innate immune response to ndv infection, with variation in gene expression being greatly reduced at 18-day infection as compared to earlier infection time points.",PMC5835104,PMC5835104_0
"The study reveals that the innate immune response to ndv infection in the chicken embryo lung is breed- and/or subline-dependent, with differences in the level of expression of immune genes between the kurooler and local ecotype sublines studied.",PMC5835104,PMC5835104_1
"The study identifies six genes (mx1, ccl5, tlr3, il-8, irf1, and stat1) involved in the innate immune response to ndv infection in the chicken embryo, with differences in expression between the kurooler and local ecotype sublines studied.",PMC5835104,PMC5835104_2
"The study demonstrates a possible role for these genes in determining the level of susceptibility of a particular line to ndv infection, with the high responders, ghs6 and m5.1, differing in the network analysis from the low responder, ghs13.",PMC5835104,PMC5835104_3
"The study highlights the potential use of the chicken embryo as a model to uncover genetic markers for both disease resistance/susceptibility and productivity traits, such as egg or meat production, allowing for screening of large numbers of birds.",PMC5835104,PMC5835104_4
