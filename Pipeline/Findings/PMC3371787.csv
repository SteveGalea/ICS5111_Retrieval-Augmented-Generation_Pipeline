"An ideal sars-cov vaccine should elicit highly potent neutralizing antibody responses against a broad spectrum of viral strains, induce protection against infection and transmission, and be safe by not inducing any infection-enhancing antibodies or harmful immune or inflammatory responses.",PMC3371787,PMC3371787_0
"Currently, an inactivated sars-cov vaccine is in clinical trials in China, but safety is the major concern for this type of vaccine, as it may induce antibodies that enhance infection by early human sars-cov and animal sars-cov-like viruses.",PMC3371787,PMC3371787_1
"The s protein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov. Recombinant vector-based vaccines expressing full-length s protein of the late sars-cov are under development, but these vaccines may induce antibodies that enhance infection by early human sars-cov and animal sars-cov-like viruses.",PMC3371787,PMC3371787_2
"Recent studies have demonstrated that recombinant rbd, a fragment of the s protein consisting of multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes, can be used as a safe and efficacious vaccine for preventing infection by sars-cov with distinct genotypes, as unlike full-length s protein, rbd does not contain immunodominant sites that induce nonneutralizing antibodies, and rbd sequences are relatively conserved.",PMC3371787,PMC3371787_3
"The s protein with truncation at aa 1153 failed to cause antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, although it still induced neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that removal of the aa 1153â€“1194 region may abrogate induction of virus infection-enhancing antibodies.",PMC3371787,PMC3371787_4
