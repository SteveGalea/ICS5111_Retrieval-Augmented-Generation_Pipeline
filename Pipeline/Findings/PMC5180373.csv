"The present study revealed that mers-covs isolated from dromedaries in the UAE were of polyphyletic origin, with one strain belonging to clade A and seven strains belonging to clade B. The source of clade A strain d988/15 was most probably different from that of the seven clade B strains.",PMC5180373,PMC5180373_0
"The seven clade B isolates belonged to three distinct lineages, with five isolates being closely related to two human mers-cov strains isolated in Oman and Abu Dhabi, respectively.",PMC5180373,PMC5180373_1
"Diverse mers-covs are co-circulating in dromedaries of the UAE and other countries in the Middle East and Africa, and both phylogenetic and amino acid substitution analyses showed that recombination events are common among certain strains of mers-cov.",PMC5180373,PMC5180373_2
"The genome sequences of the mers-cov strains isolated in the UAE were intermingled with other mers-cov strains found elsewhere in the Middle East, which derive from different sources.",PMC5180373,PMC5180373_3
"The present data showed that the genome sequences of the mers-cov strains isolated in the UAE were intermingled with other mers-cov strains found elsewhere in the Middle East, which derive from different sources. This finding is in line with the overall mers-cov phylogeny in the Middle East, with the time of the most recent common ancestor of all mers-covs being dated back to around January 2011, thus suggesting that mer-cov has emerged in humans relatively recently and will probably continue to circulate in dromedaries and humans unless effective vaccines are available.",PMC5180373,PMC5180373_4
