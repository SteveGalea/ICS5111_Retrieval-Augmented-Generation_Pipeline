"The study found that, in the community setting, most sars patients do not easily transmit infection, with transmission rates ranging between 0% and 10% [7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 21-24]. The reason that hospital transmission is more common than community transmission seems to relate primarily to three factors: the temporal profile of viral excretion, which peaks at around day 11 [25]; the patient profile of viral excretion, which seems to be greater in sicker patients [26]; and the predominant transmission route, which is probably large respiratory droplets, requiring intimate contact with sick patients or the handling of infectious secretions.",PMC2870589,PMC2870589_0
"The study found that, in the community setting, living in the same room as the case, the duration of time spent in the same room as the case, and washing the case's clothes or sheets were not associated with transmission. The finding that 'physically caring' for a symptomatic case was the only factor associated with transmission would support transmission predominantly by large respiratory droplets with limited ability for transmission by environmental contamination, fomites or aerosolization.",PMC2870589,PMC2870589_1
"The study found that isolation of symptomatic cases is a critical control measure, and that the risk of secondary transmission rises once the interval from onset of symptoms to isolation increases above 4 days.",PMC2870589,PMC2870589_2
"The study found that there was no evidence of onward transmission from the two unrecognized infections identified in the study, despite the absence of quarantine for these individuals. This suggests that sub-clinical cases are not important in terms of sustaining transmission, and that analysis of sars-cov serology requires careful interpretation and indicates that elisa screening should be supplemented with additional tests to verify specificity of sars elisa reactivity, especially in the absence of a clinically compatible illness.",PMC2870589,PMC2870589_3
"The study found that, in the community setting, the overall risk of community transmission of sars is low, generally requires intimate and unprotected contact with an ill sars case, and can be further minimized by rapid isolation of symptomatic cases. However, notable and well-publicized exceptions to this rule include the index case in Hong Kong and the Amoy Gardens outbreak.",PMC2870589,PMC2870589_4
