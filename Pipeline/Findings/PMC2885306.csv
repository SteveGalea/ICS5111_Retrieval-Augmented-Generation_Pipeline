"The study investigated the mbl2 gene, which is involved in the regulation of inflammation and tissue repair, in over 300 individuals from Europe and Africa.",PMC2885306,PMC2885306_0
"The researchers found three major mbl2 haplotypes (h, l, and p) associated with high mbl2 levels, with the haplotype frequency distributions differing among the populations studied.",PMC2885306,PMC2885306_1
"They also identified two recent European haplotypes (x and y) and two ancestral African haplotypes (q and r), as well as haplotypes specific for individuals of African ancestry residing in Europe (h' and l').",PMC2885306,PMC2885306_2
"The study revealed that the mbl2 gene has undergone strong natural selection, with high nucleotide diversities, significant temporal trends in haplotype frequencies, and signatures of balancing selection.",PMC2885306,PMC2885306_3
"The authors suggested that the mbl2 gene may have played a role in the evolutionary adaptation of humans to infectious diseases, as mbl2 levels are increased in the context of infections and inflammation.",PMC2885306,PMC2885306_4
