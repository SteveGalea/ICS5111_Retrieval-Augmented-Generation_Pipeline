"This study identified a diverse group of cress-dna viruses in marine invertebrates, with approximately one-third having no significant similarities to known viruses in the database.",PMC4498126,PMC4498126_0
"The marine-associated cress-dna viruses identified here form a distinct viral family, with members sharing an average pairwise identity score of 47.2%.",PMC4498126,PMC4498126_1
"The study developed a method to characterize highly divergent putative caps for metagenomic cress-dna viruses, as caps in the database were dominated by type a idp profiles, while the majority of the new marine invertebrate-associated genomes presented here exhibited type b idp profiles.",PMC4498126,PMC4498126_2
"The study found that the caps in the database were dominated by type a idp profiles, while 50 of the cress-dna genomes analyzed here (17.1%) contained a non-rep-encoding orf that did not exhibit either the type a or type b profile, which may represent novel caps or non-viral mobile genetic elements.",PMC4498126,PMC4498126_3
"The study revealed that cress-dna viruses exhibit regions in which disorder is conserved despite rapidly evolving amino acids, which may prove useful to identify novel cress-dna viral structural proteins that cannot be identified by standard blast searches.",PMC4498126,PMC4498126_4
