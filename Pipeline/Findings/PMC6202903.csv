"The patient presented with severe acute laryngitis, classified with 11 points on the Westley's scale, requiring tracheal intubation.",PMC6202903,PMC6202903_0
"After scheduled extubation, the patient experienced respiratory distress due to significant laryngeal edema, evidenced by bronchoscopy, but the use of high-flow nasal cannula improved respiratory function and prevented reintubation.",PMC6202903,PMC6202903_1
The patient's history of intubation for 17 days in the neonatal period and intubation in the emergency room may have contributed to persistent glottis edema and extubation failure.,PMC6202903,PMC6202903_2
"The use of high-flow nasal cannula was efficient and suggested a possible adjuvant for treating acute laryngitis, avoiding worsening respiratory conditions and the need for reintubation.",PMC6202903,PMC6202903_3
The patient's persistent laryngeal stridor after high-flow nasal cannula use may indicate latent problems from previous tracheal intubation during the neonatal period.,PMC6202903,PMC6202903_4
