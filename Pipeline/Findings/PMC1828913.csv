"Proteome chips have been used to characterize the functions of thousands of proteins in a parallel format. For example, in a study by Zhu et al. (2001), yeast proteome chips were used to identify previously uncharacterized calmodulin binding proteins, revealing a novel consensus binding motif.",PMC1828913,PMC1828913_0
"Proteome chips have also been used to discover new functionalities for previously characterized proteins. In another study by Hall et al. (2004), yeast proteome chips were used to identify previously unknown dna binding proteins, including arg5,6, a mitochondrial enzyme that appears to have a role in directly regulating the target-of-rapamycin (tor) dependent nutrient response network.",PMC1828913,PMC1828913_1
"Proteome chips have been used to discover protein–drug interactions. In a study by Huang et al. (2004), yeast proteome microarrays were used to probe protein interactions with small molecules in one experiment to discover interactions and to confirm previously known interactions.",PMC1828913,PMC1828913_2
"Proteome chips have been used to study protein–receptor interactions in a high-throughput fashion. In a study by Jones et al. (2006), protein microarrays containing most of the human binding domain proteins were probed with 66 fluorescently labeled peptides representing the binding sites of the epidermal growth factor receptors (egfr), and the resulting fluorescence data was used to calculate dissociation constants to determine the binding affinities of the peptide-binding domain interactions.",PMC1828913,PMC1828913_3
"Proteome chips have been used to study protein phosphorylation in yeast. In a study by Ptacek et al. (2005), yeast protein kinases or kinase complexes were overexpressed in yeast, and a yeast proteome microarray was created to screen patient's sera for the presence of antibodies against coronaviruses. They found that their coronavirus protein array was an excellent way to quickly diagnose those patients displaying symptoms of sars infection.",PMC1828913,PMC1828913_4
