The study investigated the effect of heterogeneities in travel patterns on the exportation of cases during epidemics caused by respiratory infections.,PMC2857283,PMC2857283_0
"The results showed that high-frequency travelers, who have a higher probability of traveling while still incubating infection, can significantly accelerate international spread of an epidemic.",PMC2857283,PMC2857283_1
"The study found that heterogeneities in travel patterns increase the variability between simulated outbreaks, with some simulations resulting in hundreds of exported cases and many resulting in only a few exported cases.",PMC2857283,PMC2857283_2
The study also demonstrated that the probability that any infected person will travel while still incubating infection is a critical factor in determining the rate of exportation of cases.,PMC2857283,PMC2857283_3
"The study suggested that targeting interventions to frequent travelers, particularly early in the course of an outbreak, may not be an effective control strategy due to the vagaries of chance and the complexities of the international airline network.",PMC2857283,PMC2857283_4
