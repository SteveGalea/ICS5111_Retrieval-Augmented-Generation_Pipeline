"Lipid rafts, as membrane components, are involved in different stages of the viral life cycle of ibv, a prototype avian coronavirus, including viral attachment, entry, and genome replication.",PMC5231368,PMC5231368_0
"Ibv structural proteins, particularly the spike protein (s), co-localize with lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, and the drug-induced disruption of lipid rafts in vero cells inhibited ibv infection, likely due to the role of lipid rafts in viral attachment.",PMC5231368,PMC5231368_1
"The ibv-susceptible cell lines a549 and df1 treated with mβcd before or after ibv attachment showed that the depletion of lipid rafts by mβcd suppressed ibv n expression in both cell lines when cells were treated with mβcd before ibv attachment, indicating that mβcd treatment directly inhibited ibv attachment and that drug-induced lipid raft disruption mainly blocked ibv attachment to host cells.",PMC5231368,PMC5231368_2
"The ibv s protein and other structural proteins likely interact with lipid rafts, which may increase the local concentration of viral structural proteins, particularly that of ibv s protein, to facilitate ibv infection.",PMC5231368,PMC5231368_3
"Lipid rafts, as attachment factors, may promote viral adhesion to facilitate ibv endocytosis, and their involvement in ibv entry goes beyond this molecule, as pathogen-host interactions may promote lipid raft clustering and focal adhesion formation during endocytosis.",PMC5231368,PMC5231368_4
