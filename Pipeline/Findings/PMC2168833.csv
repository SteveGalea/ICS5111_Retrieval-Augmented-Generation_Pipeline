"Antiviral antibodies play a critical role in suppressing replication and preventing the selection of ctl escape variant viruses during both acute and chronic stages of infection. This is illustrated in the study by the authors, as jhmv-infected balb/b jhd mice with suboptimal antibody protection develop high virus burdens and ctl escape variants, while optimally protected mice do not.",PMC2168833,PMC2168833_0
"Ctl escape most commonly occurs in the presence of a ctl response exhibiting high selective pressure, as observed in jhd mice, where ctl escape variants are selected in all infected mice.",PMC2168833,PMC2168833_1
"A robust antiviral neutralizing antibody response, in combination with high-avidity ctl responses, decreases the likelihood of ctl escape by limiting virus replication and persistence. This is supported by the poorly controlled growth of ctl escape variant viruses in jhmv-infected balb/b jhd mice.",PMC2168833,PMC2168833_2
"When antiviral antibody responses are suboptimal or absent, high-avidity ctl responses may not effectively control virus replication or limit persistence, and the adaptive immune response that is focused solely on immunodominant ctl epitopes may more readily select for ctl escape variant viruses.",PMC2168833,PMC2168833_3
"The selection of ctl escape variant viruses is influenced by the magnitude and functional avidity of ctl responses and is more common when virus clearance is delayed, as observed in hiv-infected patients. However, the authors' results are the first to directly establish a link between antiviral antibody responses, diminished virus clearance, and the selection of ctl escape variant viruses.",PMC2168833,PMC2168833_4
