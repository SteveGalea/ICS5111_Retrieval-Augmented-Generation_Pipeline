Successful phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation was performed in an African lion with congenital cataracts.,PMC6340255,PMC6340255_0
"The lioness showed moderate intraocular inflammation in the first 2 weeks after surgery, which gradually resolved over 8 weeks.",PMC6340255,PMC6340255_1
"Topical antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment was reduced due to the lioness' unstable anesthesia and aggressive behavior, but adequate treatment was still provided.",PMC6340255,PMC6340255_2
Both eyes achieved good vision with the lenses properly positioned and no signs of active intraocular inflammation 7 years after surgery.,PMC6340255,PMC6340255_3
"The lioness' behavior significantly improved after the surgery, and the iop measurement was considered appropriate for this patient with the extracted lenses. Shortening of the lens haptics was necessary due to manual error during the measurement of the lens dimensions by ocular ultrasound.",PMC6340255,PMC6340255_4
