"In the section discussing the use of gold nanoparticles in vaccines, the authors report that gold nanoparticles can be used as adjuvants to enhance the immune response to vaccine antigens. This can increase the antibody response, improve the stability of the antigens, and provide better protection against infectious diseases such as influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, and malaria. Gold nanoparticles can also be used to deliver antigens to specific cells, such as dendritic cells in lymph nodes, for the design of vaccines against diseases such as malaria and listeriosis.",PMC6154615,PMC6154615_0
"The authors also mention that gold nanoparticles can be functionalized with surface ligands, such as polysaccharides or lipopolysaccharides, to target specific cells or tissues for vaccine delivery. This can improve the targeting specificity and reduce the potential for adverse side effects.",PMC6154615,PMC6154615_1
"The authors highlight that gold nanoparticles can be used to deliver antigens to intracellular sites, such as the cytoplasm, for the design of vaccines against intracellular pathogens such as mycobacterium tuberculosis.",PMC6154615,PMC6154615_2
"The authors also discuss the potential use of gold nanoparticles in the development of vaccines against viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus, where they can be conjugated to viral surface proteins to block viral replication and virus-induced cytopathogenic effects.",PMC6154615,PMC6154615_3
"The authors note that the use of gold nanoparticles in vaccines can also enhance the stability and bioavailability of vaccine antigens, which can improve the overall effectiveness of the vaccines. However, they also caution that the use of gold nanoparticles carries added costs, and the logistics systems for vaccine distribution need to be strengthened and optimized as newer and more expensive vaccines are introduced and attempted to reach people of different ages and in new settings.",PMC6154615,PMC6154615_4
