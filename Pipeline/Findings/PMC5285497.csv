"This study identified two novel hcov-oc43 recombinant genotypes, designated as genotypes f and g, which co-circulated worldwide. These genotypes likely diverged from a genotype d-like common ancestor through natural recombination around the late 2000s to early 2010s.",PMC5285497,PMC5285497_0
"The study used observations from phylogenetic, recombination, and comparative genomic analyses on full-length genome sequences to better understand the evolutionary dynamics, pathogenesis, and disease burden of hcov-oc43 infections.",PMC5285497,PMC5285497_1
"The study found that greater than 55% of the global spread of genotype d was linked to transmission clusters, with 90% of the transmissions restricted within China. This finding highlights the role of networks in fueling and sustaining the onward transmission of pathogen, and underscores the importance of networks in understanding the spread and dynamics of viral diseases attributed to specific genotypes circulating in the population.",PMC5285497,PMC5285497_2
"The study also found that the highly conserved rdrp and n genes, which are typically used for genotype classification, result in poorly resolved phylogenetic trees. Therefore, a more consistent and reliable naming system, which considers genetic recombination as an important and common feature in hcov evolution, is proposed.",PMC5285497,PMC5285497_3
"The study's findings also revealed that the n-terminal domain of the s1 subunit contains several signature amino acid mutations, including a three-nucleotide insertion that resulted in the introduction of a glycine residue in the malaysian genotype f strains. Whether this introduction has a role in enhancing the binding of ntd to the sugar receptors of the host cells, which subsequently enhances the pathogenicity of hcov-oc43, requires further investigation.",PMC5285497,PMC5285497_4
