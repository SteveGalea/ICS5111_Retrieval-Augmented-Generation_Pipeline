"The study detected haemoproteus parasites in 35% of great frigatebirds sampled on Europas islands, with no significant difference between adults and chicks. This prevalence is similar to other studies on frigatebirds, and blood films examinations did not reveal any parasites of any blood stages, suggesting a low parasite load.",PMC4014603,PMC4014603_0
Genetic analyses supported that the detected haemoproteus parasite was closely related to haemoproteus iwa previously detected in frigatebirds in different geographic locations. No significant genetic diversity was observed among the limited number of sequences available in public databases.,PMC4014603,PMC4014603_1
"The study also revealed the absence of haemoproteus in red-footed boobies on Europas islands, despite their close interactions with frigatebirds. This finding suggests a potential strict host-vector specificity, which may explain the lack of haemoproteus infection in red-footed boobies.",PMC4014603,PMC4014603_2
"The study identified hippoboscid fly species related to olfersia spinifera in frigatebirds and olfersia aenescens in blue-footed boobies on Tromelin island, further supporting the potential strict host-vector specificity.",PMC4014603,PMC4014603_3
"The study also detected a plasmodium parasite in a great frigatebird on Europas island, related to plasmodium species identified in a large range of hosts and geographic locations. The complete host and geographic distribution of this parasite in the islands of the western Indian Ocean remain to be identified.",PMC4014603,PMC4014603_4
