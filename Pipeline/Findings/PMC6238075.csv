"In the context of the global health community, a major challenge is addressing vaccine-preventable diseases in the context of declining vaccination coverage in 25 countries between 2010 and 2015.",PMC6238075,PMC6238075_0
"In the context of vaccine manufacturing and supply chain, innovative solutions are required to overcome challenges in the areas of vaccine quality, safety, and efficacy, as well as in vaccine delivery and administration or protection level and duration.",PMC6238075,PMC6238075_1
"In the context of vaccine regulatory requirements, global harmonization of standards for vaccine quality, safety, and efficacy is essential, as well as the implementation of weight, volume, and local production criteria, and the introduction of electronic tendering processes.",PMC6238075,PMC6238075_2
"In the context of vaccine technology platforms, flexible manufacturing capabilities for clinical-grade material in 3-4 months, as well as multiplexed immunoassay technologies, are required to accelerate vaccine development through reduced serum requirements, high analytical throughput, and standardized procedures.",PMC6238075,PMC6238075_3
"In the context of vaccine delivery and administration, innovative solutions are necessary to reduce vaccine storage, transportation, and waste management costs, such as the use of novel nanoparticle technology platforms based on baculovirus and sf9 cells expressing recombinant, properly folded, functional antigens, as well as the use of lyophilized vaccine presentations that reduce package volume and shipping weight by over 50%.",PMC6238075,PMC6238075_4
