"In a laboratory setting, xenosurveillance has been shown to be effective at detecting viral genomes, as well as genetic signatures of human infecting bacteria and parasites, at clinically relevant levels.",PMC5544101,PMC5544101_0
"The limits of parasitemia, bacteremia, and viremia detection by xenosurveillance have been determined for four major human pathogens, representing three different taxa of disease-causing agents.",PMC5544101,PMC5544101_1
"Mosquitoes fed on a pathogenemic host can transmit transcripts or genomes from these pathogens in their bloodmeals, making xenosurveillance a useful tool for pathogen detection in low-tech environments.",PMC5544101,PMC5544101_2
"Xenosurveillance can detect genetic signatures from three separate taxa of pathogens at or below clinically reported pathogenemia, and rna can be reliably detected up to 24 hours postbloodmeal for all four species.",PMC5544101,PMC5544101_3
"The success of blood source identification using dna extracted from the bloodmeal of anopheles mosquitoes significantly decreases after 30 hours, making it important to note that these pathogens are not vectored by mosquitoes, and rna detected in m-dbs arose from the bloodmeal, although it does appear there is slight replication of b. Anthracis in the mosquito midgut.",PMC5544101,PMC5544101_4
