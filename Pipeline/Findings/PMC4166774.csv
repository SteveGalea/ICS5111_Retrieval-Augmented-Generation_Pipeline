"The study identified eight t-cell epitopes in the conserved region of the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) with a total score ≥ 1 and an IC50 value ≤ 100. These epitopes interacted with a total of 11 MHC-I alleles, with cysslildy (KLRQKVKLQKLQKLQKL) being the most successful due to its interaction with the highest number (11) of alleles.",PMC4166774,PMC4166774_0
The study found that the cysslildy epitope also showed the highest binding affinity for MHC-I alleles among the eight epitopes identified.,PMC4166774,PMC4166774_1
The study predicted that the region of the MERS-CoV RBD from 367 to 606 amino acids showed the highest b-cell antigenicity peak (nynltkllslfsvndftcsqispaaiasncysslildyfsypl) among all the MERS-CoV RBD sequences analyzed.,PMC4166774,PMC4166774_2
"The study identified twelve antigenic determinants in the MERS-CoV RBD, with an average antigenic propensity of 1.050.",PMC4166774,PMC4166774_3
"The study found that the cysslildy epitope was also a part of the region that showed the highest b-cell antigenicity peak, suggesting that it may have potential as a universal vaccine component against MERS-CoV.",PMC4166774,PMC4166774_4
