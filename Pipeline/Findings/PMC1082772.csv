"The authors identified two novel subgenomic RNAs, mRNA 2-1 and mRNA 3-1, in SARS-CoV-infected cells. These RNAs have unique junction sequences that differ from those of the other eight identified subgenomic RNAs. The mRNA 3-1 junction sequence contains a noncanonical three nucleotide sequence, aaa, which may serve as a transcription-regulating signal for subgenomic RNA synthesis.",PMC1082772,PMC1082772_0
"The authors confirmed the coexistence of both plus- and minus-strand subgenomic-length RNAs in SARS-CoV-infected cells, supporting the model of discontinuous minus-strand synthesis. The junction sequences of all eight SARS-CoV subgenomic RNAs, which are easily detected by Northern blotting, contain the canonical core sequence, acgaac, but the sequence patterns of CS-b were retained in the junction region, indicating that the junction sequences originate from CS-b, and this supports the discontinuous minus-strand synthesis model.",PMC1082772,PMC1082772_1
"The authors found that the CS-bs of both mRNA 2-1 and mRNA 3-1 contain one-nucleotide mismatch with CS-l, but the sequence patterns of CS-b were retained in the junction region, suggesting that the junction sequences originate from CS-b, and this supports the discontinuous minus-strand synthesis model. While the mismatch in mRNA 3-1 is at the second position of the hexanucleotides, the template switch can be envisaged to take place at the sequence motif aaa, just preceding the leader core sequence and 3 nucleotides upstream from the complementary body core sequence of mRNA 3-1.",PMC1082772,PMC1082772_2
"The authors showed that each subgenomic mRNA has a unique fusion site that is different from all others, and the junction sequences of coronavirus subgenomic RNAs originate from CS-b, and this supports the discontinuous minus-strand synthesis model. The uniqueness of the fusion sites of SARS-CoV subgenomic RNAs could play a regulatory role in controlling the",PMC1082772,PMC1082772_3
