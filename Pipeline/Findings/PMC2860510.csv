"B19v infection is associated with severe anemia in malaria-endemic regions, and this anemia is exacerbated by prior use of the antimalarial drug, chloroquine (CQ).",PMC2860510,PMC2860510_0
"CQ promotes B19v viral replication in bone marrow, resulting in a higher number of particles available for nuclear targeting.",PMC2860510,PMC2860510_1
"Other viral infections, such as SfV, EMCV, and EBV, are also enhanced by CQ but not by other 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial drugs.",PMC2860510,PMC2860510_2
"The lowest hemoglobin concentrations are in children with both igm and pcr positivity, who were presumably at the stage of maximal viral replication and consequent bone marrow suppression.",PMC2860510,PMC2860510_3
The prevalence of severe malarial anemia should fall as a result of the increasing emergence of resistant P. Falciparum and P. Vivax and the decreasing use of CQ throughout the tropics.,PMC2860510,PMC2860510_4
