"The authors present a model for estimating the reproductive number of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) in South Africa. They use a next generation approach to estimate the reproductive number of XDR TB, with equations describing nosocomial and community-based transmission. The model includes a probability of emergence and a probability of extinction, with the probability of extinction simplified if the number of secondary cases produced is poisson distributed. The model incorporates the possibility that individuals in a population have different transmission potential using moment-generating functions.",PMC2678614,PMC2678614_0
"The authors find that the waiting time for XDR TB patients to receive therapy is determined by a queueing system, where patients who become XDR TB suspects are put in a queue to test for drug resistance. The proportion of patients who enter a treatment program is the rate of entry multiplied by the minimum of either the entire demanding population or the fraction of the demanding population for which there is program capacity. The number admitted is ξmin(y, b − n), where b is the number of program spaces (e.g., beds in a hospital ward), and n is the number of current occupants. The authors use a generalized form of the queueing system based on insights from queuing systems applied to housing shortages and vaccination programs.",PMC2678614,PMC2678614_1
"The authors estimate the probability of XDR TB epidemics in the context of different South African communities. They calculate the probability of emergence as 1 minus the probability of extinction, with the probability of extinction simplified if the number of secondary cases produced is poisson distributed. The probability of emergence is 1 minus the probability of extinction, which is calculated from the estimated value of r in the population, including the variance in the infectiousness among patients from in vivo air sampling studies to incorporate heterogeneity among individuals.",PMC2678614,PMC2678614_2
"The authors find that the probability of extinction simplifies to ploss = σj = 0,∞p(ultimate extinction|j secondary cases produced) × p(j secondary cases produced), where j is the number of secondary cases produced by a primary XDR TB case, and p(ultimate extinction|j secondary cases produced) is the probability of ultimate extinction given that j secondary cases are produced, summed across all j: ploss = σj = 0,∞",PMC2678614,PMC2678614_3
