"The study isolated and characterized a new strain of infectious bronchitis virus, IRFibv32, in Iran.",PMC3329954,PMC3329954_0
"The virus was detected in the trachea, lung, kidney, caecal tonsil, and intestine of infected birds.",PMC3329954,PMC3329954_1
The virus persisted longer in the kidney and caecal tonsil than in the respiratory tissues.,PMC3329954,PMC3329954_2
The clinical signs and gross lesions due to ibv infection were more severe and of longer duration in dually infected chicks (with infectious bursal disease virus and ibv) than in ones inoculated with ibv.,PMC3329954,PMC3329954_3
Future work should aim to determine if the available and used ib vaccines provide sufficient protection against this ibv isolate.,PMC3329954,PMC3329954_4
