The current study confirmed the presence of two coronaviruses (group 1b and group 2d) in bats in the Philippines.,PMC3298303,PMC3298303_0
"Both viruses were detected in fruit bats, which can be infected with viruses without showing any signs of infection.",PMC3298303,PMC3298303_1
The prevalence of virus RNA was high in each bat species tested.,PMC3298303,PMC3298303_2
The level of viral genome amplification in fruit bats orally infected with tissue from virus-infected bats was lower than that in bats infected with viruses from field samples obtained from different species of bats.,PMC3298303,PMC3298303_3
"The findings suggest that coronaviruses in bats can be orally transmitted across species and may infect fruit bats of many species, implying that interspecies transmission in bats may be common.",PMC3298303,PMC3298303_4
"The study also indicates that bat coronaviruses may be easily transmitted across species, but further investigation is needed to better understand the risk for infection with this virus.",PMC3298303,PMC3298303_5
"The study found that bat coronaviruses may infect fruit bats without causing any signs of infection, but a bat coronavirus culture system is needed to obtain additional information about these viruses.",PMC3298303,PMC3298303_6
"The findings suggest that coronaviruses in bats may circulate worldwide, as they were detected in bats in several regions, including Germany, North and South America, and Africa, as well as in the Philippines.",PMC3298303,PMC3298303_7
The study also found that replication of group 2d bat coronaviruses in the intestine is low in fruit bats orally infected with tissue from virus-infected bats.,PMC3298303,PMC3298303_8
"However, the level of viral genome amplification in fecal samples by real-time PCR was higher than that in oral infection, implying that bat coronaviruses may replicate in fruit bats' intestine and feces.",PMC3298303,PMC3298303_9
"The study also found that the amount of large intestine obtained per bat was less than 100 mg, making it difficult to obtain sufficient tissue to isolate viruses.",PMC3298303,PMC3298303_10
"The findings suggest that fruit bats can be infected with bat coronaviruses without showing any signs of infection, but more investigation is needed to better understand the risk for infection with this virus.",PMC3298303,PMC3298303_11
The study found that bat coronaviruses can,PMC3298303,PMC3298303_12
