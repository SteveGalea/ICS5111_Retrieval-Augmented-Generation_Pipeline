"The study revealed that different movements required during intubation using different airway devices can influence the degree of protection afforded by some respirators, depending on the type of airway device used.",PMC5909605,PMC5909605_0
"The study found that the adequate protection and fit factor values differed according to the type of airway device scenario when intubations were performed wearing the cup-type respirator, but not when wearing the fold-type respirator.",PMC5909605,PMC5909605_1
"The study demonstrated that the different movements required when using the different airway devices could affect the protection provided by the different types of respirators, depending on the type of airway device used.",PMC5909605,PMC5909605_2
The study suggested that emergency physicians should take into account the effects of airway device types on fit factor of n95 respirators when performing intubation at risk of infection.,PMC5909605,PMC5909605_3
"The study revealed that the intubation time was longer when using the macintosh laryngoscope than when using the other airway devices, but the intubation success rate was 100% for all three devices.",PMC5909605,PMC5909605_4
