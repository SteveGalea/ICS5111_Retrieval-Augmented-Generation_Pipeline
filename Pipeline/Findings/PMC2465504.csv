"In a study of 3,421 Chinese adults, the risk of reporting poor health increased by 2.6% with each percentage increase in income inequality after adjusting for potential confounding individual-level and provincial-level income variables in China during 1991-97. The effect of income inequality on health was stronger than using the mean gini coefficients from a 10-year period and consistently increased from 1991 to 1997. (500 words)",PMC2465504,PMC2465504_0
"The study found evidence of an independent effect of income inequality on self-reported health status after adjusting for potential confounding individual-level and provincial-level income variables in China during 1991-97.

"The study highlights that, although many developing countries are now focusing more on the absolute economic and income growth, the experience from China indicates that absolute increase in income does not necessarily guarantee the improvement of health for all.
