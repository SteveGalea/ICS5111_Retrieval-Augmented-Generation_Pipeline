"Long single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecules exhibit coarse-grained structure characterized by their molecular length (molecular length distribution, MLD) and degree of branching (radii of gyration, Rg) in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on the MLD alone. However, there are notable discrepancies between predicted and measured sizes, particularly for long RNAs, which can be remedied by estimating MLD from structure-probing data or selecting structures with MLDs compatible with experimentally determined hydrodynamic radii.",PMC5113152,PMC5113152_0
"Hydrodynamic size reduction is observed in the presence of multivalent ions, indicating the importance of repulsive electrostatic interactions and formation of tertiary contacts stabilized by multivalent cations, not accounted for in the theoretical approach used here.",PMC5113152,PMC5113152_1
"The observed differences in compactness and extendedness of RNA molecules may reflect various biological functions they perform. For example, viruses with segmented RNA genomes may preferentially utilize extended, less branched RNA conformations for their segment precursors to minimize the formation of nonspecific intersegment RNA-RNA contacts, while enabling formation of specific interactions facilitated by viral RNA chaperones.",PMC5113152,PMC5113152_2
"The effects of di- and polyvalent cations are more prominent for smaller RNAs, such as riboswitches and ribozymes, which adopt compact and unique tertiary structures in the presence of Mg2+ via formation of specific tertiary contacts. Due to the heterogeneity of secondary structures in long RNAs, such specific contacts would be harder to achieve, while also explaining why long RNAs often require auxiliary proteins to guide their folding into a unique structure.",PMC5113152,PMC5113152_3
"Long RNAs exhibit a broad distribution of MLDs, and the size of RNA molecules can be estimated using coarse-grained theoretical predictions based on ensembles of predicted secondary structures and MLD averaging, even in the presence of multivalent ions stabilizing tertiary contacts. This feature of RNA, likely due to a limited repertoire of interactions offered by the four nucleobases, points to a fundamental limitation of RNA as a complex biopolymer when compared to proteins.",PMC5113152,PMC5113152_4
