"The study identified two cell lines, fbrcs and vido r2, that complement the essential functions (e1a) required for adenovirus replication, allowing the generation of replication-defective adenovirus vectors.",PMC112946,PMC112946_0
"The study demonstrated that the e1a proteins of hav-5 could complement those of bav-3 during viral replication, indicating that the e1a proteins of adenoviruses are functionally homologous.",PMC112946,PMC112946_1
"The study generated replication-defective bav-3 recombinants expressing gd of bhv-1 and he of bcv, which may serve as safe expression systems or nonreplicating vaccine vectors for cattle.",PMC112946,PMC112946_2
"The study constructed a recombinant bav-3 expressing gfp, which represents an important tool for characterizing and potentially improving its properties as a viral vector for somatic gene therapy in humans.",PMC112946,PMC112946_3
"The study showed that the e1a proteins of hav-5 could complement those of bav-3 in mdbk and fbrc cells, suggesting that the e1a proteins of adenoviruses are functionally homologous.",PMC112946,PMC112946_4
