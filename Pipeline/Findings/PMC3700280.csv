Combination therapy of def201 and mabs provides extended postexposure treatment window against ebola virus (EBV) infection.,PMC3700280,PMC3700280_0
"Def201, a replication-defective human adenovirus serotype 5 expressing alpha interferon (IFN-Î±), administered 1 or 2 days postinfection (d.p.i.), delays the timing of mab treatment and allows for complete survival in guinea pigs against EBV.",PMC3700280,PMC3700280_1
"Combination therapy of def201 and mabs at 3 d.p.i. provides complete survival in guinea pigs against EBV, with a significant delay in mab treatment.",PMC3700280,PMC3700280_2
"EBV viremia levels measured by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR demonstrate correlation with survival, and the combination therapy at 3 d.p.i. strongly suppresses viral replication.",PMC3700280,PMC3700280_3
"The combination therapy of def201 and mabs at 3 d.p.i. provides complete survival in guinea pigs against EBV, and rapid administration of def201 results in complete survival provided that specific mabs are administered within 7 d.p.i., with partial survival observed for treatment at 8 d.p.i. This combination therapy holds promise for the treatment of EBV infection in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans and can likely be adapted against other filoviruses.",PMC3700280,PMC3700280_4
