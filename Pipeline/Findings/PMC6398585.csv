"Spatial models that take into account the patterns of human spread and mobility can improve our ability to characterize and anticipate spatial expansion of infectious diseases. During the 2015-2016 yellow fever outbreak in central Africa, estimates of geographic spread to provinces outside Luanda, the capital of Angola, were published over 6 months after the last cases were reported. This information could guide public health institutions to decide where and when to implement surveillance and control programs.",PMC6398585,PMC6398585_0
The challenge to accurately reconstruct the epidemic pathway of the virus in the Americas during the 2014-2017 Zika outbreak was further complicated by its relatively unspecific clinical presentation. This may explain why the initial studies that aimed to understand the geographic origin of the Zika epidemic in the Americas were published over 1 year after the first reports of human cases.,PMC6398585,PMC6398585_1
"During the 2013-2017 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, estimates of geographic spread to provinces outside Luanda, the capital of Angola, were published over 6 months after the last cases were reported. This information could guide public health institutions to decide where and when to implement surveillance and control programs.",PMC6398585,PMC6398585_2
"Integrating data sources, such as spatial, genomic, and epidemiological, can provide insights into heterogeneity in transmission and the characteristics of the inter-human transmission. For example, during the 2014-2017 Zika outbreak in the Americas, combining genomic data from the outbreak with epidemiological analysis revealed that the outbreak was driven by a large number of introductions rather than by persistent local transmission.",PMC6398585,PMC6398585_3
The perceived ability of models to successfully or unsuccessfully make ‘correct’ predictions can generate considerable controversy. There are few studies that systematically investigate forecasting accuracy and its relationship to the length of time that is being predicted and to the quantity and quality of data available. This is an important area for future research.,PMC6398585,PMC6398585_4
