"In this case, the cat presented with severe neutropenia, recurrent febrile episodes, and hyperglobulinemia, prompting an extensive search for infectious, neoplastic, and toxic causes of neutropenia.",PMC4204839,PMC4204839_0
"Bone marrow evaluation revealed marked neutropenia with a mild diffuse histiocytosis, a marked decrease in mature and immature neutrophils, and a moderate overall decrease in erythroid precursors.",PMC4204839,PMC4204839_1
"The cat responded positively to immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone and cyclosporine, and long-term immunosuppression also caused suspected reactivation of latent herpes virus and subsequent corneal ulceration.",PMC4204839,PMC4204839_2
"No obvious concurrent immune-mediated disease was noted in this case, though bone marrow hyperplasia is more commonly associated with this disorder in dogs and humans, but hypoplasia can also be seen, as in this case, if autoantibodies are directed at bone marrow precursors.",PMC4204839,PMC4204839_3
"The only documented case of secondary immune-mediated neutropenia was in a cat with a thymoma, though secondary immune-mediated neutropenia in humans has been associated with drug administration, other immune-mediated disorders, and lymphoproliferative diseases.",PMC4204839,PMC4204839_4
