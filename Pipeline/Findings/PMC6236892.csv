"The study revealed 2363 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in infected cat intestines compared to controls, with 811 DEGs at 96 hours post-infection (hpi).",PMC6236892,PMC6236892_0
"The largest difference in enriched pathways was observed at 96 hpi, with DEGs mainly enriched in catalytic activity and metabolic processes.",PMC6236892,PMC6236892_1
"The anti-T. gondii defense response of the feline host was mediated by major histocompatibility complex class I, proteasomes, heat-shock proteins, and fatty acid binding proteins.",PMC6236892,PMC6236892_2
The study revealed novel host factors critical for T. gondii's successful establishment in the feline intestine.,PMC6236892,PMC6236892_3
The temporal changes in DEGs in infected cat intestines suggest that the transcriptional response evolves over the course of infection.,PMC6236892,PMC6236892_4
