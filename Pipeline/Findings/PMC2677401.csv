"Respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV), are commonly associated with asthma exacerbations.",PMC2677401,PMC2677401_0
RSV and RV can cause inflammation and airway reactivity through strain differences and the host immune response.,PMC2677401,PMC2677401_1
"HMPV has a smaller amount of viral replication and a low number of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of infected mice due to a decreased type I interferon response, potentially leading to a more successful infection.",PMC2677401,PMC2677401_2
"Atypical bacteria, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, are also associated with asthma exacerbations, but the mechanisms leading to these conditions are not fully understood.",PMC2677401,PMC2677401_3
"Preexisting allergic inflammation impairs the ability to up-regulate TLR2 and IL-6 in the lungs, leading to decreased clearance of M. Pneumoniae and an increase in airway inflammation.",PMC2677401,PMC2677401_4
