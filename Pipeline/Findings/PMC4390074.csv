"Discovery of a large number of previously undescribed viruses through metagenomic approaches, leading to the identification of new viruses associated with various diseases. For example, the discovery of the bocavirus in respiratory and neurological diseases, the human polyomavirus Merkel cell virus (MCV) in Merkel cell carcinoma, and the recent discovery of the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) in a severe febrile syndrome with thrombocytopenia.",PMC4390074,PMC4390074_0
"The challenge of confirming the causal relationship between a newly discovered virus and a disease due to the difficulty in meeting the criteria of Koch or adapted versions of these criteria. For instance, the need to isolate the virus in cell culture or animal models and to demonstrate an immune response specific to the virus.",PMC4390074,PMC4390074_1
The importance of considering the potential role of viruses as co-infecting agents or as latent viruses reactivated during the inflammatory process or as part of the normal microbiota of the host.,PMC4390074,PMC4390074_2
"The need to investigate the potential association between a virus and a disease through a multidisciplinary approach, including clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory studies. For example, the recent investigation of the human norovirus (HuNoV) in gastroenteritis, which involved the detection of the virus in patients with diarrhea, the characterization of the virus and its variants, the investigation of the virus in outbreak settings, and the development of diagnostic tools.",PMC4390074,PMC4390074_3
"The need to balance the potential benefits of metagenomic approaches, which can provide a broad picture of the viruses present in a sample and do not require prior knowledge of the viral genome or cell culture, with the importance of meeting the criteria for establishing a causal relationship between a virus and a disease, which requires a multidisciplinary approach and the use of specific criteria.",PMC4390074,PMC4390074_4
