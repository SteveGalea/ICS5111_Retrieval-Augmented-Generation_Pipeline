"This study found that allometric scaling of peak vo2 effectively removed the influence of body mass on peak vo2 in both southern Chinese boys and girls, but the scaling exponents differed by age, with greater exponents generated in older males and females subgroups.",PMC6413916,PMC6413916_0
"The study also revealed that peak vo2 remained associated with height and age in both southern Chinese boys and girls, despite allometric scaling, highlighting the need for alternative approaches to monitor changes in cardiopulmonary fitness over time.",PMC6413916,PMC6413916_1
"A z score calculation was developed to allow comparisons across different age and sex groups, as peak vo2 remained correlated with body mass, height, and age in all subgroups, even after allometric scaling.",PMC6413916,PMC6413916_2
"The study showed that the developmental pattern for ratio-scaled peak vo2 differed from that of absolute peak vo2, with increases observed from 11 to 12 years of age in both southern Chinese boys and girls, and continued increases from 12 to 15 years of age in older males.",PMC6413916,PMC6413916_3
"The study recommended the use of z scores for identifying southern Chinese children with poor cardiopulmonary fitness, and provided an accessible data processing tool for this purpose.",PMC6413916,PMC6413916_4
