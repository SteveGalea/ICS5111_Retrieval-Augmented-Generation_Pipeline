"Rhmpv-pa, a live attenuated human metapneumovirus vaccine, was evaluated in three phases: in 15 adults at a dose of 106.0 plaque-forming units (pfu), in 15 hmpv-seropositive children at a dose of 106.0 pfu, and in 15 hmpv-seronegative children at doses of 105.0 and 106.0 pfu.",PMC6075531,PMC6075531_0
"In all phases, vaccine virus was not detected, nor were neutralizing or hmpv fusion (f) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses detected.",PMC6075531,PMC6075531_1
"In the phase evaluating a dose of 106.0 pfu in hmpv-seropositive children, antibody responses were detected in 2 asymptomatic vaccine recipients.",PMC6075531,PMC6075531_2
"In the phase evaluating a dose of 106.0 pfu in hmpv-seronegative children, shedding of vaccine virus was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 2 asymptomatic vaccine recipients, and antibody responses were detected in 3 vaccine recipients and 5 vaccine recipients, including those who shed vaccine virus.",PMC6075531,PMC6075531_3
The study was terminated due to the vaccine's overattenuation in hmpv-seronegative children. The results suggest that an effective hmpv vaccine could prevent a substantial number of respiratory tract illnesses in young children and highlight the need for placebo-controlled trials and assessment for adventitious viral infections in this population.,PMC6075531,PMC6075531_4
