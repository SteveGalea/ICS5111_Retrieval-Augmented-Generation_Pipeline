"This cross-sectional study found that Isospora suis (Iso) was present on 70% of the 50 swine farms in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The level of shedding of Iso oocysts was associated with diarrhea at the litter level, but there was no significant difference in Iso-positive farms between those with completely slatted flooring and those with solid flooring or all-in/all-out flow.",PMC3022462,PMC3022462_0
"The study showed that Iso-positive litters had diarrhea more frequently than Iso-negative litters, but farms with diarrhea as a common problem in suckling pigs had a lower likelihood of being positive for Iso.",PMC3022462,PMC3022462_1
The study found that Iso-positive farms were less likely to use detergent in the cleaning process and less likely to perceive diarrhea in suckling pigs as a common problem.,PMC3022462,PMC3022462_2
The study found that Iso was more likely to be found on farms where diarrhea in suckling pigs was not perceived as a common problem compared to farms where diarrhea was perceived as a common problem.,PMC3022462,PMC3022462_3
The study showed that Iso was more likely to be found on farms where diarrhea started at 2 to 4 days of age rather than at older ages.,PMC3022462,PMC3022462_4
