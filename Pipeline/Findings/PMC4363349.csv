"Comorbidity is a key aspect to differentiate the impacts of SARS and MERS viruses. Diabetes has a higher comorbidity impact on life expectancy than HIV, according to a UK doctor.",PMC4363349,PMC4363349_0
"A quantitative framework has been developed to compare and explore comorbidity between diseases using neighbourhood-based benchmarks and topological methods. SARS and HIV infections dysregulate similar genes and pathways, with 4 significantly dysregulated genes affecting the ageing process for both.",PMC4363349,PMC4363349_1
"SARS and HIV infections dysregulate 11 genes and 3 pathways in common, and only 4 significantly dysregulated genes are common between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",PMC4363349,PMC4363349_2
"The response of SARS-affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response that dysregulates a large number of genes, pathways, and PPIs subnetworks in different pathologies such as heart failure, breast cancer, and bone diseases.",PMC4363349,PMC4363349_3
"Electronic supplementary material provides data on differentially expressed genes between SARS and control groups in PBMCs, as well as between HIV and control groups, and tables of gene-disease associations and pathways related to SARS and HIV infections. Phenotypic disease associations for both infections are also presented based on ICD9 codes at different category levels. Additional files also include median expression profiles for SARS and MERS viruses using hierarchical clustering and predicted drugs to reverse SARS-CoV for early and sustained signatures.",PMC4363349,PMC4363349_4
