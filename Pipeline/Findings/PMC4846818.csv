"A study by Wang et al. (2016) identified SSC-mir-30d-r_1 as a potential therapeutic target for PRRS viral infection in pigs. The researchers used a pig genome database and the MIRANDA algorithm to identify potential target genes for selected significant differentially expressed miRNAs. They then amplified fragments corresponding to the 5'-UTR, 3'-UTR, and nonstructural and structural genes (nsp1a, nsp1b, nsp2-nsp5, nsp7-nsp12, orf2a, orf2b, orf3-orf7) of PRRSv and subcloned them into a reporter vector downstream of the luciferase orf to generate 19 target genes. The normalized firefly luciferase activity was compared between SSC-mir-30d-r_1 mimic and the control mimic cells in infected pigs.",PMC4846818,PMC4846818_0
