"This study identified five novel infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) genotypes in Tunisian broiler chickens, including the recently reported Tunisian field variants TN200/01 and TN335/01.",PMC6065601,PMC6065601_0
"The newly identified genotypes, TN296/07 and TN556/07, showed significant variability in their S1 gene sequences compared to the previously reported Tunisian field variants and other reference IBV strains.",PMC6065601,PMC6065601_1
Sequence analyses and phylogeny data suggested that the emergence of the two new genotypes may be related to the two major forces that drive coronavirus evolution: mutation due to high error rates of the viral RNA polymerase and recombination.,PMC6065601,PMC6065601_2
The study highlighted the persistence of IBV infection in younger animals and the need for in vivo studies to determine the pathogenic characteristics of TN296/07 and TN556/07 genotypes and evaluate the cross-protective level provided by the mass H120 vaccine.,PMC6065601,PMC6065601_3
"The study underscored the importance of addressing the question of whether positive selection pressures have driven H120 strain evolution, resulting in the emergence of new IBV variants in the field.",PMC6065601,PMC6065601_4
