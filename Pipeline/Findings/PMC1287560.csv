"In the study on the effects of mutations in the poly(A) tract of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA on viral RNA accumulation in Nicotiana benthamiana, it was found that 15 single-nucleotide substitutions were used to study the function of the putative polyadenylation signal, a1a2u3a4a5a6, of BMV RNA. The results showed that substitutions at the polyadenylation motif (aauaaa) in the 3' UTR of BMV RNA affected polyadenylation efficiency, as well as RNA accumulation. Mutants in category 3, with shorter poly(A) tails of less than 100 as, had much shorter poly(A) tails of less than 100 as (Fig. 5).",PMC1287560,PMC1287560_0
"The study also revealed that mutations in the aauaaa motif in the 3' UTR of BMV RNA could influence the efficiency of polyadenylation, as well as RNA accumulation, since mutants with shorter poly(A) tails would lead to more efficient turnover and less efficient RNA accumulation in plants.",PMC1287560,PMC1287560_1
"It was also found that two cis elements in the 3' UTRs of BMV RNA, the hexanucleotide motif (specifically, the near-ubiquitous aauaaa sequence) and several plausible u-rich elements upstream (Fig. 1), were essential for cytoplasmic RNA polyadenylation, with at least three trans factors required for the process, including the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein, the hexanucleotide binding protein, and the poly(A) polymerase (9, 13, 21, 36).",PMC1287560,PMC1287560_2
"The study also provided insight into the role of the a1a2u3a4a5a6 motif in BMV RNA accumulation, as it was found to be sensitive to a change from a4 to u4, and it may be involved in minus-strand RNA accumulation, possibly by regulating the polyadenylation reaction.",PMC1287560,PMC1287560_3
