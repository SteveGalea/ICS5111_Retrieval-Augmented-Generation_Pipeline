"The study describes the isolation and characterization of a novel alpaca coronavirus, named acov, during an outbreak of severe respiratory disease and associated abortions in alpaca in 2007.",PMC3528286,PMC3528286_0
"Similarities between the whole genome sequences of acov and human coronavirus 229E, a virus first isolated around 1960, suggest a transmission event between humans and alpacas.",PMC3528286,PMC3528286_1
"Molecular studies suggest the possibility that the speculative transmission event between humans and camelids was recent, as the evolutionary ancestor appears more closely related to hCoV-229E viruses isolated around 1960, and acovs may have been circulating for decades at low levels in alpaca populations.",PMC3528286,PMC3528286_2
"Most alphacoronaviruses, including acov, utilize aminopeptidase n, a host receptor, and host tropism differences of viruses are caused by the ability of their spike proteins to detect small species-specific amino acid differences in the aminopeptidase n.",PMC3528286,PMC3528286_3
"Despite the host specificity of this receptor, all of those viruses are known to bind and utilize feline aminopeptidase n, suggesting a common coronavirus ancestor infecting feline species around 1960.",PMC3528286,PMC3528286_4
"The study suggests that vaccines targeting betacoronaviruses will likely not prevent infection with alphacoronaviruses, such as acov, due to the different cell entry mechanism.",PMC3528286,PMC3528286_5
"The spike gene has the critical role of virus entry and membrane fusion processes in the host cell, and evolutionary studies monitoring hCoV-229E strains suggest the mutation patterns can be associated with geographic origin, rather than with virulence patterns.",PMC3528286,PMC3528286_6
"The study provides strong evidence of an evolutionary relationship between hCoV-229E and acov, and whether the virus represents a recent cross-species transmission or a more distant transmission between humans and alpacas is yet to be determined.",PMC3528286,PMC3528286_7
"The study suggests that the acov has an extra putative orf “x” overlapping the 3' end of the nucleocapsid gene, and further laboratory experiments will be required to determine if this gene is expressed and whether",PMC3528286,PMC3528286_8
