"The quantitative icp-ms method established in this study demonstrated good sensitivity and application in the pharmacokinetics study of polyoxometalates, with a linear correlation between the oral doses and auc0-96, auc0-âˆž, and cmax for compound 1 (p<0.01).",PMC4055585,PMC4055585_0
"The pharmacokinetic behavior of compound 1 after intravenous or oral administration followed a two-compartment model, with a half-life between 20 and 30 hours and a high level of compound 1 accumulation in vivo.",PMC4055585,PMC4055585_1
"Compound 1 was widely distributed throughout the body, with the highest deposition at 0.25 hours found in the stomach and intestine, but these concentrations decreased over time, suggesting that the main route of absorption is through the gastrointestinal tract.",PMC4055585,PMC4055585_2
"Compound 1 was highly bound to plasma proteins at 9-18 mg/ml and moderately bound at 36 mg/ml, indicating that most of compound 1 exists in a combined form with plasma protein in systemic circulation, but the binding force may be weak, and it is likely to be out-competed by other high-binding drugs.",PMC4055585,PMC4055585_3
"The clearance from tissues is rather quick, with the content in tissues less than 10% of the peak content at 96 hours, and the main route of excretion of compound 1 was through feces, which contained about 30% of the drug tested, while urine contained about 0.28% and bile contained about 0.42%. These findings provide a foundation for further study of metabolism of compound 1.",PMC4055585,PMC4055585_4
