"The study introduces a generalized-growth model to characterize the early rise of infectious disease outbreaks and reveals significant variation in growth profiles across different pathogens and temporal and social contexts, representing both established and emerging viral pathogens with a particular focus on Ebola.",PMC4903879,PMC4903879_0
"The model reveals evidence for sub-exponential growth patterns in the majority of the 20 outbreaks studied, representing both established and emerging viral pathogens with a particular focus on Ebola.",PMC4903879,PMC4903879_1
"The study hypothesizes that sub-exponential growth may result from highly constrained population contact structures, population immunity, or the early onset of behavior changes or control interventions.",PMC4903879,PMC4903879_2
"The approach could prove useful to systematically characterize spatial heterogeneity arising from infectious disease spread in specific contact structures, assess shifts in epidemic growth patterns, refine mathematical transmission models, and improve disease forecasting.",PMC4903879,PMC4903879_3
"The study notes that while the generalized-growth approach described here is useful for characterization of empirical outbreaks and may have applications for disease forecasting, this approach does not provide a straightforward equivalent to the reproduction number, r 0â€”except for the special case of exponential growth (p = 1).",PMC4903879,PMC4903879_4
