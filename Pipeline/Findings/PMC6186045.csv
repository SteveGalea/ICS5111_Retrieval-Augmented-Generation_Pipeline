"Next-generation sequencing revealed differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs in TGEV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells, linked to inflammation-related pathways.",PMC6186045,PMC6186045_0
"Overexpression of miR-22 reduced p-IκB-α and promoted nuclear accumulation of p65 in TGEV-infected cells, while inhibition of miR-22 had the opposite effect.",PMC6186045,PMC6186045_1
Silencing of circRNA ssc_circ_009380 inhibited nuclear accumulation of p65 and phosphorylation of IκB-α in TGEV-infected cells.,PMC6186045,PMC6186045_2
"MiR-22 directly bound to circRNA ssc_circ_009380, promoting activation of the NF-κB pathway during TGEV-induced inflammation in porcine intestinal epithelial cells.",PMC6186045,PMC6186045_3
"Differentially expressed mRNAs and ncRNAs were primarily enriched in inflammation-related pathways, including NF-κB, TLR, NLR, Jak-STAT, TNF, and RIG-I-like receptor pathways.",PMC6186045,PMC6186045_4
