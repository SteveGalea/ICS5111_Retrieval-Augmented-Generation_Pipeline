"The experiment demonstrated the spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) to nearly all feed- and non-feed-contact surfaces in a feed manufacturing facility, with viral contamination particularly challenging to decontaminate, even with the aid of wet sanitizers and heat.",PMC5242487,PMC5242487_0
"The study found that plastic and rubber surfaces were less conducive to PEDV contamination compared to concrete and metal surfaces, likely due to their smoother attributes.",PMC5242487,PMC5242487_1
"The experiment showed that equipment surfaces, due to direct contact with contaminated feed, had greater contamination compared to structural surfaces, which were less conducive to contamination but still showed significant contamination.",PMC5242487,PMC5242487_2
"Dust generated during processing of contaminated feed was found to lead to contamination of previously uncontaminated surfaces, emphasizing the important role dust particles may play in the spread of biological hazards throughout a feed manufacturing facility.",PMC5242487,PMC5242487_3
"The study highlights the need for feed mill operators to be particularly judicious regarding use of good manufacturing practices and biosecurity protocols to exclude PEDV from entry into the feed mill, as the virus was spread to nearly all feed- and non-feed-contact surfaces and was particularly challenging to decontaminate, even with the aid of wet sanitizers and heat. Additional research is necessary to understand the role of dust in animal food biological hazard transmission and to formulate practical feed mill sanitation recommendations to prevent and reduce PEDV contamination of equipment and facilities.",PMC5242487,PMC5242487_4
