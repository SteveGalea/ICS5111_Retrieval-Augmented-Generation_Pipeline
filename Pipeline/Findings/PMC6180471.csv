"In a study examining the effectiveness of ecmo support in critically ill patients, hospital survival was achieved in 72% of patients, which is in agreement with data reported in developed countries. The authors attribute this to the use of more rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria, which resulted in restricting the use of ecmo to highly selected patients, and to the provision of adequate training and experience to the multidisciplinary team.",PMC6180471,PMC6180471_0
"The authors also found that the initial tidal volume of patients who died was lower than that of survivors, suggesting greater severity of lung injuries and poorer lung compliance in the former. The simplified acute physiology score 3 (SAPS 3) did not differ in survivors and nonsurvivors, but the respiratory score was higher in survivors.",PMC6180471,PMC6180471_1
"The authors noted that severe hypoxemia may occur during the acute phase of respiratory support and sometimes needs to be tolerated by the team, but it does not directly affect survival or cognitive outcome. They also found that energy failure was avoided by using a hand pump for one patient and by turning off the warning lights for another patient.",PMC6180471,PMC6180471_2
"The authors reported that only decreases in oxygen saturation less than 85% and greater than 70% were observed, which occurred because of the severity of lung injury, associated with a cardiac output. Severe hypoxemia may occur during the acute phase of respiratory support, and this complication may not directly affect survival or cognitive outcome.",PMC6180471,PMC6180471_3
"The authors highlighted that the most serious problems that arose during transport were addressed, such as avoiding energy failure by using a hand pump for one patient and by turning off the warning lights for another patient. Only decreases in oxygen saturation less than 85% and greater than 70% were observed, which occurred because of the severity of lung injury, associated with a cardiac output. Severe hypoxemia may occur during the acute phase of respiratory support, but it does not directly affect survival or cognitive outcome.",PMC6180471,PMC6180471_4
