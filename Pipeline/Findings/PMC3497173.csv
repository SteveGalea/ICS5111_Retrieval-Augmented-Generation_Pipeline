"Resistance to (rff)3rxb-acpp, a peptide conjugate with antimicrobial activity, can be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the peptide transporter sbma.",PMC3497173,PMC3497173_0
"Resistance to (rff)3rxb-acpp is not caused by mutations in known oligopeptide transporters, but instead by mutations in sbma.",PMC3497173,PMC3497173_1
"The specificity of sbma, a peptide transporter, is not necessarily limited to either the l- or d-enantiomeric form of a peptide and is broader than previously known.",PMC3497173,PMC3497173_2
"The substrate specificity of sbma is apparently not limited to thiazole- or oxazole-containing compounds or to proline-rich peptides, but is linked to the spacing of cationic and nonpolar amino acid residues within the context of the peptide.",PMC3497173,PMC3497173_3
"The rate of occurrence of spontaneous resistance to (rff)3rxb-acpp is similar to that of spontaneous changes in other bacterial phenotypes, and the rate of occurrence of mutations leading to resistance to (rff)3rxb-acpp is similar to the rate of occurrence of mutations leading to other bacterial phenotypes.",PMC3497173,PMC3497173_4
