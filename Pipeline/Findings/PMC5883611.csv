The study reports the first cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) asymmetric reconstruction of bacteriophage p22 after it has released its packaged double-stranded DNA chromosome.,PMC5883611,PMC5883611_0
The study reveals that the portal structure in empty p22 particles remains essentially unchanged inside the capsid after dna release and does not revert to the conformation observed in mature virions.,PMC5883611,PMC5883611_1
"The study shows that the portal structure in empty p22 particles undergoes a conformational change with respect to the conformation observed in mature virions, with the top of the c-terminal barrel appearing to be splayed out in the empty particle.",PMC5883611,PMC5883611_2
"The study identifies a substantial density, not present in virions, that extends away from gp10 at the distal tip of the short tail in empty p22 particles. This density is not affected by ""surfboards,"" which appear in less than 10% of the particles, and is not ascribed to gp26 because these particles have a premature stop at codon 53 in gene 26. The study hypothesizes that this short tube-like density may serve as a precursor assembly in the formation of a longer tube comprised of the other ejection proteins, and the longer tube is used to deliver the virion genome into the host cytoplasm through the outer membrane, peptidoglycan layer, periplasmic space, and inner membrane.",PMC5883611,PMC5883611_3
