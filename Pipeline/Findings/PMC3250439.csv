"The study found that the pandemic H1N1 virus, SD/09, can efficiently replicate in the lungs of mice, causing severe respiratory illness with high lethality, similar to human cases.",PMC3250439,PMC3250439_0
"The study identified that the optimal dose for viral inoculation in mice is 102.5 pfu per mouse, as this dose prolongs the course of the disease and causes obvious signs of respiratory illness.",PMC3250439,PMC3250439_1
"The study found that the value of MLD50 for SD/09 virus is 101.5 pfu per mLD50, and this virus causes severe respiratory illness in mice, with high lethality.",PMC3250439,PMC3250439_2
