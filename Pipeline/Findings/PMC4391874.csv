The lack of all five Ifitm genes in the Ifitmdel mouse model leads to obesity and metabolic syndrome phenotypes due to altered leptin signaling and metabolic homeostasis regulation.,PMC4391874,PMC4391874_0
"The Ifitmdel mouse model exhibits a unique metabolic phenotype characterized by an enhanced accumulation of white adipose mass and increased expression of leptin, despite normal leptin levels, due to altered leptin signaling through its receptor in the hypothalamus.",PMC4391874,PMC4391874_1
"The altered leptin signaling through its receptor in the hypothalamus of the Ifitmdel mouse model leads to depressed expression of proopiomelanocortin (Pomc), a neuropeptide that suppresses feeding, and enhanced expression of neuropeptide Y (Npy), a neuropeptide that promotes feeding activity, which corresponds to the increased feeding behavior of these animals.",PMC4391874,PMC4391874_2
"The Ifitmdel mouse model exhibits a striking and common microglial cell morphology throughout the brain tissues, characterized by extremely long and usually mono-polar processes that extended from the cell body with few bifurcations and smaller and less distinct cell bodies, which may specifically affect leptin signaling and the production of neuropeptides such as Pomc or Npy.",PMC4391874,PMC4391874_3
"The altered Pomc expression regulation and microglial cell morphology in the Ifitmdel mouse model could lead to altered and potentially toxic microenvironments due to the function(s) of the Ifitm proteins in development and maintenance of the central nervous system, which are crucial to normal brain cellular architecture and interaction, and their role in regulating important endocrine functions.",PMC4391874,PMC4391874_4
