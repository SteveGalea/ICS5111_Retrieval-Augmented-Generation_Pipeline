The study found a significant positive correlation between monthly occurrence of Kawasaki disease (KD) and monthly overall viral detection in Korea from 2009 to 2011.,PMC4117846,PMC4117846_0
"The study revealed that the monthly incidence of KD showed strong positive correlation with the monthly overall viral detection, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.382 (p = 0.022).",PMC4117846,PMC4117846_1
"The study showed that the incidence of human bocavirus and enterovirus correlated significantly with monthly patterns of KD occurrence, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.032 (p = 0.007) and 0.007 (p = 0.007), respectively.",PMC4117846,PMC4117846_2
"The study found that the monthly incidence of KD showed significant positive correlation with monthly detection of influenza virus, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.063 (p = 0.063).",PMC4117846,PMC4117846_3
"The study showed that KD occurred most frequently in the summer and winter seasons, with the highest incidence in July and December, respectively. However, the study also found that KD occurred least often in February and October throughout the study period.",PMC4117846,PMC4117846_4
