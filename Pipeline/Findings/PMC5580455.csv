"In the context of the study on the antiviral effects of probiotics, one key finding is that the probiotic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus CUL2 can significantly reduce the severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis (RV) infection in a mouse model, as shown in Figure 1B. Another important finding is that this probiotic strain can also reduce the mortality rate in a mouse model infected with RV (Figure 1C).",PMC5580455,PMC5580455_0
"In the context of a study on the mechanisms underlying viral-induced immune evasion, one important finding is that the viral protein NF1-interacting sterile 20 (NIAS2) present in human cytomegalovirus (CMV) can promote viral replication and immune evasion by inhibiting the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) protein, as demonstrated in Figure 2A and B.",PMC5580455,PMC5580455_1
"In the context of a study on the mechanisms underlying viral-induced cell death, one key finding is that infection with the coronavirus (CoV) TGEV strain can induce apoptosis through activation of the extrinsic pathway regulated by the death receptor Fas/FasL, as shown in Figure 4A. Another important finding is that the viral protein NSP6 present in TGEV can also promote viral replication by inhibiting apoptosis, as demonstrated in Figure 4B.",PMC5580455,PMC5580455_2
"In the context of a study on the effects of ultraviolet (UV) light on viral replication, one important finding is that UV-inactivated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cannot induce apoptosis in human T lymphocytes (Figure 6C), indicating the importance of viral replication in inducing apoptosis.",PMC5580455,PMC5580455_3
"In the context of a study on the effects of ultraviolet (UV) light on viral replication, another key finding is that UV-inactivated human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and type 18 cannot induce apoptosis in human cervical epithelial carcinoma cells (Figure 6D), suggesting the importance of viral replication in inducing apoptosis.",PMC5580455,PMC5580455_4
