"The study showed that vaccination with the sars-cov s-protein dna vaccine, when coadministered with an il-2-expressing plasmid, resulted in enhanced immune responses, including increased antigen-specific proliferative responses, higher levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production, and increased CD8+ T cell numbers, compared to those in mice given the antigen-encoding plasmid alone.",PMC1951058,PMC1951058_0
"The study also found that the administration of il-2, as an adjuvant, augmented viral antigen-specific Th1 immune responses and improved clinical outcomes in animal models of chronic viral infection.",PMC1951058,PMC1951058_1
"The study demonstrated that immunization by the intramuscular (i.m.) route, electroporation, and orally by using live attenuated Salmonella typhimurium, when administering the sars-cov s-protein dna vaccine, induced distinct immune response profiles. Immunization by the i.m. route and electroporation induced moderate T cell responses but vigorous antibody responses, while oral immunization induced vigorous T cell-mediated immune responses but weak antibody production predominantly of the IgG2a subclass.",PMC1951058,PMC1951058_2
"The study suggested that different formulations of the same plasmid dna vaccine could induce distinct immune responses, which may be due to the different ways of antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells when it is delivered by different routes, or the different amounts of dna used for the different routes.",PMC1951058,PMC1951058_3
"The study highlighted that the effects of dna vaccination in mice may be more dramatic than those in humans, and further refinements of the immunization conditions, especially the dna immune dose, are required to ensure the maximal expansion of sars-cov s-protein dna vaccine effectors in humans.",PMC1951058,PMC1951058_4
