"Compound 4e significantly increases the ability of hek293t cells to inhibit HIV-1 infection, as demonstrated by a single-round infectivity assay using pseudotyped HIV-1 with a proviral vector that includes all HIV-1 NL4-3 genes except NEF (replaced with GFP) and ENV, thus preserving GAG and POL, and the frameshift required for production of the GAG-POL polyprotein. This antiviral effect was confirmed by measuring the luciferase expression, which is driven by the HIV-LTR promoter.",PMC4720131,PMC4720131_0
