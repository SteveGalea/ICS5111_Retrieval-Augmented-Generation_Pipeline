MERS-COV is a highly pathogenic emerging respiratory virus that has caused a small but lethal epidemic centered in Saudi Arabia but capable of limited person-to-person spread.,PMC6074883,PMC6074883_0
"MERS-COV is a betacoronavirus, most closely related to several bat coronaviruses but probably transmitted by some still unidentified intermediate animal host.",PMC6074883,PMC6074883_1
"MERS-COV produces severe and progressive pneumonia, frequently accompanied by renal failure, and affects preferentially older adults with underlying illness, although younger individuals and children have also been infected.",PMC6074883,PMC6074883_2
"MERS-COV causes a range of illnesses, from asymptomatic infection to pneumonia with respiratory failure, and has been fatal in about half of all recorded infections.",PMC6074883,PMC6074883_3
Epidemiological human and animal investigations are required to find and identify the animal reservoir(s) that either directly or indirectly transmits the virus to humans.,PMC6074883,PMC6074883_4
