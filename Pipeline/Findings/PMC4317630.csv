"ACE2 is a critical enzyme for counteracting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and maintaining a balance between the ACE-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis and the ACE2-angiotensin 1-7-mas receptor axis. Dysregulation of this balance is associated with various diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and iga nephropathy.",PMC4317630,PMC4317630_0
"ACE2 is downregulated in hypertensive nephropathy, hypertensive cardiopathy, and subtotal nephrectomy, which might exacerbate the deleterious effects of angiotensin II on the kidneys.",PMC4317630,PMC4317630_1
"ACE2 activity is upregulated in diabetic nephropathy, and its urinary protein level and activity are useful biomarkers for this condition.",PMC4317630,PMC4317630_2
"ACE2 ectodomain shedding is partially dependent on tumor necrosis factor-alpha convertase (ADAM17), which is responsible for increased ectodomain shedding of ACE2 at least in vitro, and patients with renal disease exhibit increased expression levels of ADAM17.",PMC4317630,PMC4317630_3
"ACE2 activators, such as human recombinant ACE2 (hrACE2), might represent a new therapeutic strategy for angiotensin II overactivity, but the suggestion that ACE2 activators have supra therapeutic effects on kidney disease than classical RAS inhibitors is speculative at present, as enhancing ACE2 activity might represent a new therapeutic strategy for angiotensin II overactivity, but the short-term administration of ACE2 inhibitors, such as xanthenone (XNT) and diminazene (DIZE), did not affect renal or cardiac ACE2 activity in vitro and ex vivo experiments in both mice and rat kidney.",PMC4317630,PMC4317630_4
