"An atg5 homolog from orange-spotted grouper (ecatg5) was cloned and its roles during fish virus infection were investigated. Ecatg5 encoded a 275-amino acid protein that shared 94% and 81% identity to seabass (Lates calcarifer) and humans (Homo sapiens), respectively.",PMC6433989,PMC6433989_0
Ecatg5 functions as an e3 ligase-like enzyme and is involved in many metabolic pathways among the tissues.,PMC6433989,PMC6433989_1
Ecatg5 promoted sgiv and rgnnv replication by positively regulating autophagy activity and negatively regulating antiviral ifn responses.,PMC6433989,PMC6433989_2
Ecatg5 affected cell cycle progression from the G1 to the S phase and arrested cells in the G1 phase.,PMC6433989,PMC6433989_3
Ecatg5 down-regulated expression levels of several interferon related cytokines or effectors and negatively regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory factors.,PMC6433989,PMC6433989_4
