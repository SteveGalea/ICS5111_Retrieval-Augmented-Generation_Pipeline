"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic agent transmitted from camels to humans through contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. It causes severe respiratory illness, with a mortality rate of up to 40% in severe cases, and has resulted in outbreaks in healthcare settings, with limited person-to-person transmission.",PMC4142007,PMC4142007_0
"Dengue virus is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and causes a range of clinical symptoms, from mild fever to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever, with a mortality rate of up to 20% in severe cases. It is endemic in many tropical and subtropical areas, with high viral loads in infected donors and a risk of up to 1500 transfusion-transmitted infections per 100,000 donations.",PMC4142007,PMC4142007_1
"Chikungunya virus is another flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and causes severe arthritis and joint pain, with a risk of up to 1500 transfusion-transmitted infections per 100,000 donations. It has resulted in large outbreaks, with increased severity and virulence in immunosuppressed individuals and pregnant women.",PMC4142007,PMC4142007_2
"Hepatitis E virus is a small, non-enveloped virus that causes the most common cause of acute hepatitis, with an estimated 20 million incident infections and 700,000 deaths per year. It is associated with waterborne and foodborne outbreaks, with increased severity in immunosuppressed individuals, such as solid organ transplant recipients. The virus is resistant to inactivation, and some plasma manufacturers screen plasma donors and/or pools to reduce the associated risk to transfusion recipients.",PMC4142007,PMC4142007_3
"West Nile virus is a flavivirus transmitted by Culex mosquitoes and causes neurological and neuroinvasive disease, with a mortality rate of up to 30% in severe cases. It has resulted in large outbreaks in North America and Europe, with increased severity in elderly individuals and individuals with underlying medical conditions.",PMC4142007,PMC4142007_4
