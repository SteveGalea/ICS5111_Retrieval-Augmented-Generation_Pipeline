"The study presents a novel ubl-pla2 assay for monitoring the fractionation of whole-cell lysates, which allows for the simultaneous measurement of multiple isopeptidases and their associated substrates. This assay offers a significant advantage over existing methods, as it enables the monitoring of relative isopeptidase activity in a high-throughput format, which is critical for the identification and validation of new isopeptidase inhibitors.",PMC2386736,PMC2386736_0
"The study demonstrates the utility of the ubl-pla2 assay for monitoring the fractionation of whole-cell lysates, as it enables the quantification of isopeptidase activity in a high-throughput format. This is significant because it allows for the rapid and efficient screening of large compound libraries for new isopeptidase inhibitors, which can facilitate the discovery of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases associated with aberrant isopeptidase activity.",PMC2386736,PMC2386736_1
"The study presents a detailed characterization of the ubiquitin ligase E3 ubiquitin-like protein (ULBP) as an isopeptidase substrate. The study shows that ULBP can be modified by the addition of ubiquitin-like proteins, which leads to the recruitment of the isopeptidase system and the deubiquitination of ULBP by isopeptidases.",PMC2386736,PMC2386736_2
"The study demonstrates the ability of the isopeptidase system to selectively deubiquitinate specific substrates, such as ULBP, and suggests a potential role for isopeptidases in the regulation of ULBP activity. This is significant because it provides insight into the function of the isopeptidase system in regulating the activity of specific substrates, which can facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diseases associated with aberrant isopeptidase activity.",PMC2386736,PMC2386736_3
"The study presents data on the dose-dependent activity of various isopeptidases, such as ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (USPs) and isopeptidases associated with the N-end rule pathway, as well as the enhancement of USP5 activity in the presence of monoubiquitin. These findings provide a better understanding of the specific roles of these isopeptidases in the regulation of substrate",PMC2386736,PMC2386736_4
