The meta-analysis conducted in this study revealed that the ifn-γ rs2430561 t/a genetic polymorphism is associated with significantly reduced risk of persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and individuals carrying the ifn-γ rs2430561 tt genotype are more likely to clear HBV spontaneously compared to those with the aa genotype.,PMC4250527,PMC4250527_0
"The study also found that the interleukin-28 beta (IL28B) rs12979860 polymorphism, which is located upstream of the IL28B gene, is not associated with outcomes of HBV infection.",PMC4250527,PMC4250527_1
"The meta-analysis suggested that the er alpha (ERA) rs2077647 t/c genetic polymorphism, which is located in exon 1, might play a role in protecting individuals against HBV persistence, as the risk of persistent HBV infection was reduced in individuals carrying the ERA rs2077647 cc genotype compared to those carrying the ct+tt genotype.",PMC4250527,PMC4250527_2
"The study revealed that ethnic differences, potential selection bias, or other factors may contribute to heterogeneities in some comparison models and deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in four studies.",PMC4250527,PMC4250527_3
"The authors noted that due to the limited availability of published results, the number of studies included in each meta-analysis was small, and further studies incorporating diverse populations and functional assays are warranted to validate and extend these findings.",PMC4250527,PMC4250527_4
