"In a mouse model, a single high dose of mdef201 administered 8 weeks prior to infection with vaccinia virus provides a high degree of protection from death, with similar effects seen with lower doses administered 1 day before infection (extended prophylaxis).",PMC3706414,PMC3706414_0
"Against vaccinia virus lri, mdef201 delivered to the nasal sinus requires a 10-fold higher dose than that delivered to the lungs in order to protect equally against body weight loss during the infection.",PMC3706414,PMC3706414_1
"In the case of cowpox virus infection, lower doses of mdef201 are less effective, requiring higher doses for efficacy against this virus strain.",PMC3706414,PMC3706414_2
"The extended prophylactic effect of mdef201 against vaccinia virus infections in mice is remarkably long, lasting at least 8 weeks after administration.",PMC3706414,PMC3706414_3
"The adenovirus vector used to deliver mdef201 is still present in the snouts of mdef201-treated mice 60 days after exposure, suggesting that the extended prophylactic effect may exist in the absence of measurable serum interferon levels.",PMC3706414,PMC3706414_4
