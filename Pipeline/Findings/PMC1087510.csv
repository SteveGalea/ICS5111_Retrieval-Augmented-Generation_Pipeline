"A full-length sars-cov cDNA-containing plasmid has been developed, which allows for functional analysis of each gene in the context of infection and can be used for making attenuated strains for vaccine development (500 words).",PMC1087510,PMC1087510_0
"The s protein, which binds the virus receptor, exhibited minor genetic diversity among 8 strains transmitted during human outbreaks in early 2003. Synthetic versions of these s variants with human preferred codons were tested for their ability to bind the receptor and their sensitivity to antibody neutralization with viral pseudotypes. Antibodies that neutralized most human isolates-derived s proteins unexpectedly enhanced entry mediated by the civet virus-derived s proteins (500 words).",PMC1087510,PMC1087510_1
"A study on the evolving s protein molecular diversity in sars-cov isolates and its unexpected profound immunofunctional effects illustrates the need to understand the molecular potential of the sars-cov genome in developing vaccines to prevent human disease. As mentioned previously, studies also point to the fact that variability in the s protein from early to late disease outbreak stages has been detected (500 words).",PMC1087510,PMC1087510_2
"Attenuated live virus, which is a genetically engineered version of live sars-cov with traits such as attenuated phenotype, increased immunogenicity, and safe handling, is a third possible strategy for developing vaccines against sars-cov (500 words).",PMC1087510,PMC1087510_3
"The rapid development of successful vaccines against sars-cov virus depends upon continuing basic research due to limitations regarding vaccine development, such as a lack of complete understanding in the areas of animal models of the disease as well as host immune responses to the evolving molecular diversity of this newly emerged human virus (500 words).",PMC1087510,PMC1087510_4
"The s protein, which is derived from the guangdong province case isolate and two palm civets isolates, exhibited functional differences in s derived from these isolates. Antibodies that neutralized most human isolates-derived s proteins unexpectedly enhanced entry mediated by the civet virus-derived s proteins (10 to 20 words per finding).",PMC1087510,PMC1087510_5
