"A retrospective analysis of 1,500 children and adults with community-acquired pneumonia in the United States found that high-quality sputum specimens, compared to nasopharyngeal (np/op) specimens, had a higher diagnostic yield for bacteria, viruses, and atypical pathogens, with an average of 25 white blood cells and fewer than 10 epithelial cells per low-power field.",PMC5228222,PMC5228222_0
"The study showed that high-quality sputum specimens were positive for 53% of bacterial targets compared to 39% for np/op specimens, while high-quality sputum specimens were positive for 46% of viral targets compared to 32% for np/op specimens.",PMC5228222,PMC5228222_1
"For atypical pathogens, 58% of high-quality sputum specimens were positive compared to 38% for np/op specimens.",PMC5228222,PMC5228222_2
"The study also found that the relative diagnostic yield contributed by high-quality sputum specimens was higher for bacteria and viruses compared to atypical pathogens, with an average of 25 white blood cells and fewer than 10 epithelial cells per low-power field.",PMC5228222,PMC5228222_3
"High-quality sputum specimens were also found to have an earlier crossing threshold (CT) value for each pathogen, indicating a higher pathogen load.",PMC5228222,PMC5228222_4
"The study showed that high-quality sputum specimens and np/op specimens had a percent agreement of 98% for bacterial targets, 98% for viral targets, and 98% for atypical pathogens, with an average of 25 white blood cells and fewer than 10 epithelial cells per low-power field.",PMC5228222,PMC5228222_5
