"The study found that two genetic variants in the promoter region of the DC-SIGN gene, DC-SIGN -139 GG and -939 AA, were significantly associated with increased risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in a Cantonese population.",PMC2989958,PMC2989958_0
"The study also identified two new variants, DC-SIGN -116 G/T and -190 A/G, although their minor allele frequencies were low (0.6% and 0.3%, respectively).",PMC2989958,PMC2989958_1
"The study revealed that the allelic distribution of DC-SIGN genes differed widely in populations from different ethnic groups, presumably due to selective pressure exerted by prevalent pathogens in these geographically distinct regions.",PMC2989958,PMC2989958_2
"The study showed that the mutant genotypes DC-SIGN -139 GG and -939 AA detected in the promoter region of the DC-SIGN gene were involved in NPC susceptibility, and further studies are necessary to demonstrate the role of DC-SIGN promoter polymorphisms in the function of DC-SIGN as well as their effect on EBV infection.",PMC2989958,PMC2989958_3
"The study suggests that DC-SIGN, a protein expressed on the surface of dendritic cells (DCs), may serve as a putative receptor for secretory iga (SIgA) on immature DCs by binding to high mannose glycoprotein on SIGA protein, which may promote EBV infection of immature DCs. However, further studies are necessary to confirm this link.",PMC2989958,PMC2989958_4
