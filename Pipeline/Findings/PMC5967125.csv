"In viruses of the family endornaviridae, which have a monocistronic RNA genome, there is still little information about how the large polyprotein is processed.",PMC5967125,PMC5967125_0
"The viral proteinase of the potyviral protein hc has functions beyond its proteolytic activity, including aphid transmission, RNA silencing suppression, and virion assembly.",PMC5967125,PMC5967125_1
"Proteases from viruses of the family closteroviridae, which encode self-cleaving leader proteinases, have roles beyond proteolytic activity, including virus accumulation, systemic transport, host range expansion, and virus superinfection exclusion.",PMC5967125,PMC5967125_2
"Viruses of the family badnavirus, which have a narrow host range, have p1a-like leader serine proteases whose cleavage is essential for virus infectivity, and alternative adaptation to different hosts is determined by differences in the p1 target sequence.",PMC5967125,PMC5967125_3
"Viral proteinases, such as the one from the ipomovirus cucumber vein yellowing virus (cvyv), have a role beyond proteolytic activity, including stimulating viral RNA translation.",PMC5967125,PMC5967125_4
