"PEDV is a highly contagious swine disease caused by a coronavirus with a genome size of approximately 26-32 kb. Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, and death due to dehydration and starvation, with mortality rates of 80-100% in infected piglets.",PMC4056290,PMC4056290_0
"PEDV spreads primarily through fecal-oral contact, and while older pigs may survive, infected piglets typically die within 24 hours. Vaccines for PEDV exist in some countries, but the virus is still evolving in the US swine population.",PMC4056290,PMC4056290_1
"A PEDV strain isolated from a infected piglet in 2013 was sequenced and compared to its in vitro adapted version. The strains shared 99% identity, except for six nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the spike gene, resulting in six aa substitutions.",PMC4056290,PMC4056290_2
"The spike protein, which mediates viral entry, contains numerous neutralizing antibody binding epitopes and interacts with the cell receptor papn. However, VERO and Marc145 cells, which lack papn, can still support PEDV replication through other receptors or receptor-independent pathways.",PMC4056290,PMC4056290_3
"Analysis of the spike protein shows that cell culture adaptation specifically modifies the pedv spike protein, with one trypsin cleavage site lost and the number of chymotrypsin sites remaining unchanged. The immunological implications of these changes are unknown.",PMC4056290,PMC4056290_4
