"The study identified a few distinct csf proteins, some of which have biological functions that appear of direct interest for mscl, such as protein jagged-1 and vitamin d-binding protein. Jagged-1 has been implicated in mscl, as its differential abundance was not observed in any of the pp mscl samples but small peaks of this peptide were detected in 6/11 rr mscl samples. Vitamin d-binding protein has pleiotropic functions beyond vitamin d metabolism, as it can significantly enhance the chemotactic response to complement fragment C5a and has substantial stimulatory effects on macrophages.",PMC2929207,PMC2929207_0
"The study showed that serum levels of vitamin d-binding protein were decreased significantly in rr mscl patients compared to other neurological disorders. Vitamin d, which directly and indirectly regulates the differentiation, activation of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, and can prevent the development of autoimmune processes, may be involved in mscl, as the neuroprotective function of vitamin d is increasingly recognized in the progressive phase of mscl pathogenesis.",PMC2929207,PMC2929207_1
"The study identified peptides of albumin and serotransferrin, but only 2.4% and 4.8% of the identified albumin and serotransferrin peptides, respectively, had p-values below 0.01. This indicates that the values for the peptides of these two particular proteins are most likely due to other reasons than large abundance differences in these two proteins, as most of the other differentially abundant proteins found to be differentially elevated in the comparisons of both mscl types with the controls were either identified by a single peptide with a low p-value or by a small number of peptides with a low p-value.",PMC2929207,PMC2929207_2
"The study identified ryanodine receptor 1, which is involved in the maintenance of the calcium-equilibrium in brain tissue. The release of toxic levels of positively charged calcium ions may represent a key mechanism of axonal degeneration in disorders such as mscl due to the deleterious effects of excitotoxicity.",PMC2929207,PMC2929207_3
"The study showed that apolipoprotein d is a lipocalin that is mainly expressed in glia, but also in neurons",PMC2929207,PMC2929207_4
