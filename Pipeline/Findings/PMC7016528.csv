"A study found that the gut microbiota of pedv-infected piglets exhibits dysbiosis, with increased abundance of bacteria associated with diarrhea and other conditions and decreased abundance of beneficial scfa-producing bacteria.",PMC7016528,PMC7016528_0
"Another study showed that pedv infection causes negative effects by disrupting microecosystem homeostasis in porcine intestines, leading to decreased abundance of microflora related to energy metabolism, secondary metabolite synthesis, and amino acid metabolism in the intestines of pedv-infected piglets.",PMC7016528,PMC7016528_1
"The study also noted that the intestinal microbiota of healthy versus pedv-infected piglets differed significantly in terms of microbial enrichment, with some bacteria from firmicutes, bacteroides, proteobacteria, fusobacteria, verrucomicrobia, and epsilonbacteraeota being enriched in healthy piglets, while some from proteobacteria and fusobacteria were more abundant in pedv-infected groups.",PMC7016528,PMC7016528_2
"The study further revealed that pedv likely causes negative effects by disrupting microecosystem homeostasis in porcine intestines, leading to increased abundance of butyrate-producing Clostridium butyricum, a genus associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes.",PMC7016528,PMC7016528_3
"The study also suggested that regulating intestinal microbiota is a promising method for ped treatment, as providing supplements to suckling piglets based on deficiencies of individual beneficial bacteria can prevent or alleviate pedv-induced diarrhea.",PMC7016528,PMC7016528_4
