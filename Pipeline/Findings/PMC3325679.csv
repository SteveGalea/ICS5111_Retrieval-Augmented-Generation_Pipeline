"The study identified a new paramyxovirus, fmopv, in cats in Hong Kong.",PMC3325679,PMC3325679_0
"Fmopv was found to be closely related to feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline respiratory coronavirus (FRCoV), two well-known feline pathogens.",PMC3325679,PMC3325679_1
"The study also reported the presence of fmopv in 13 out of 27 (48%) cats with nephritis in Hong Kong, suggesting a potential association between fmopv and feline tinopathy (feline nephritic syndrome, FTS).",PMC3325679,PMC3325679_2
"The study found that fmopv has a distinct genome organization, with a unique arrangement of the n protein, which is a key determinant for the segment reassortment of paramyxoviruses.",PMC3325679,PMC3325679_3
"The study also found that fmopv has a high frequency of G to A substitutions at the n protein editing site, which may contribute to the high frequency of G to A substitutions at the same site in feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline sarcoma virus (FeSV), suggesting a potential role of fmopv in feline leukemogenesis.",PMC3325679,PMC3325679_4
