"The LCMV virus, when infecting mice, enhances the pathogenicity of antierythrocyte autoantibodies, leading to overt autoimmune diseases and death of the infected animals.",PMC112102,PMC112102_0
"The mechanism by which LCMV increases autoantibody pathogenicity appears to be enhancement of macrophage phagocytic activity, as shown by increased phagocytosis of antibody-coated red blood cells by macrophages from infected mice.",PMC112102,PMC112102_1
"The virus-mediated increase in autoantibody pathogenicity is currently under investigation and may be linked to an enhancement of macrophage expression of FcÎ³ receptors, molecules involved in antierythrocyte antibody-induced anemia and upregulated by interferons and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.",PMC112102,PMC112102_2
"The pathogenicity of autoantibodies depends on their microenvironment, including the microbiological status of the host, and may provide interesting information on the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and possible alternative ways to treat them.",PMC112102,PMC112102_3
"Other viruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus, can also enhance macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, suggesting that enhancement of macrophage phagocytic activity may be a mechanism shared by some viral infections to trigger or enhance autoimmune diseases.",PMC112102,PMC112102_4
