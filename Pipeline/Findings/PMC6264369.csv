"Patchouli alcohol, a natural compound found in the leaves of the plant Piper methysticum (pepppermint), displays significant inhibition against the influenza A virus H2N2 subtype, both in vitro and in vivo studies.",PMC6264369,PMC6264369_0
This anti-influenza activity is mediated via interference with the neuraminidase (na) function that cleaves the Î±-glycosidic bond between sialic acid and glycoconjugate.,PMC6264369,PMC6264369_1
"Patchouli alcohol exhibits anti-influenza A virus H2N2 subtype activity through inhibition of virus replication, as well as through reduction of mortality and weight loss in a mouse model.",PMC6264369,PMC6264369_2
Computational studies reveal that the interaction energy between patchouli alcohol and the respective residues at the na active site is a significant finding in the study of the anti-influenza A virus H2N2 subtype.,PMC6264369,PMC6264369_3
Further mechanistic studies are needed to support the potential use of patchouli alcohol in the treatment of influenza A virus infectious disease.,PMC6264369,PMC6264369_4
