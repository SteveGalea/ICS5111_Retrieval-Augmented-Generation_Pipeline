"Ribavirin and viramidine, two purine nucleoside analogs, can be phosphorylated by cytosolic nucleoside diphosphate kinase (CN-II) and adenosine kinase, but the lower catalytic efficiency values reported in this study suggest that like ribavirin, viramidine phosphorylation by CN-II is likely to be physiologically relevant due to its lower catalytic efficiency value (0.16 versus 1.8 min−1) and high km value (>600 μm) in comparison to ribavirin.",PMC1140532,PMC1140532_0
"The ribavirin-specific CN-II activity is much better than that by adenosine kinase, and the ribavirin km value (88 μm) is in the micromolar range, which is lower than that of most CN-II substrates (18) whose km values are in the millimolar range.",PMC1140532,PMC1140532_1
"The lower catalytic efficiency values reported in this study reflect the intrinsic catalytic power of CN-II and adenosine kinase towards ribavirin and viramidine, and the respective contribution of each enzyme for ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation is likely determined by the concentrations of individual enzymes and various effectors present in vivo.",PMC1140532,PMC1140532_2
"The high-level ribavirin can deplete intracellular ATP, impair ATP-dependent oxidative respiratory pathway, damage RBC membrane integrity, and eventually cause hemolytic anemia in RBCs. The slow dephosphorylation of ribavirin or the lack of ribavirin-specific nucleotidase and/or phosphatase should play a key role in accumulating ribavirin, which only amasses to a high level in RBCs.",PMC1140532,PMC1140532_3
"The relatively fast anabolism of ribavirin in RBCs should also contribute to the accumulation of ribavirin, and the slow catabolism of ribavirin or the lack of ribavirin-specific nucleotidase and/or phosphatase should play a key role in accumulating ribavirin, which only amasses",PMC1140532,PMC1140532_4
