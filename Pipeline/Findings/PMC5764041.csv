"The study shows that the vaccination regimen for PRRSV, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MHP), and Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is effective in controlling triple challenge in pigs based on clinical, microbiological, immunological, and pathological evaluation.",PMC5764041,PMC5764041_0
"The vaccinated pigs showed significantly lower clinical scores, microscopic lesion scores, and PRRSV, MHP, and PCV2 antigen levels in their lungs and lymph nodes compared to unvaccinated challenged pigs.",PMC5764041,PMC5764041_1
"The study also evaluated the effects of different vaccination strategies, including the administration of a mixture of INGELVAC CIRCOFLEX and MYCOFLEX vaccines, which allowed for the comparison of the effects of different vaccination strategies under the same experimental conditions.",PMC5764041,PMC5764041_2
The study found that vaccination with Mycoplasma and PCV2 vaccine in vaccinated pigs induces a stronger cellular immune response as measured by frequency of MHP- and PCV2-specific IFN-Î³-sc compared to pigs vaccinated with other vaccines in bi-vac/ch group.,PMC5764041,PMC5764041_3
"The study provides new options in controlling PRDC through concurrent administration of single-dose of PRRSV, MHP, and PCV2 vaccines, as it was the first comparative experimental study for the triple vaccination of pigs with PRRSV, MHP, and PCV2.",PMC5764041,PMC5764041_4
