"The current study demonstrates that overexpression of angiotensin-(1-7) or ace2, the enzyme that generates angiotensin-(1-7), has protective effects against lung diseases, particularly involving lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension.",PMC2970847,PMC2970847_0
Angiotensin-(1-7) has been shown to prevent the development of pulmonary hypertension and related cardiac pathophysiologies in the monocrotaline model of ph.,PMC2970847,PMC2970847_1
The study shows that overexpression of angiotensin-(1-7) before induction of ph results in prevention of the elevated pressure and attenuation of the remodeling effects on the heart by inhibiting vascular remodeling.,PMC2970847,PMC2970847_2
"The study reveals that elevated lung mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines are observed in the mct model of ph, and overexpression of angiotensin-(1-7) prevents the increase in the mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines (il-1β, il-6, and tnf-α) and produces an increase in the antiinflammatory cytokine (il-10).",PMC2970847,PMC2970847_3
"The study suggests that targeting of the pulmonary ace2/ang-(1-7)/mas axis could provide a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of lung diseases, particularly involving lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension, as most effective therapeutic effect may be accomplished with a dual treatment regimen due to the fact that some of the findings suggest that ace2 and ang-(1-7) mediate their protective effects by different pathways.",PMC2970847,PMC2970847_4
