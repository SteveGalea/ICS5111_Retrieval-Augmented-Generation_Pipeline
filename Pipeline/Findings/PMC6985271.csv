"A novel technology, protacs, has been developed to selectively target the degradation of the usp18 protein, which represents the major isg15-specific protease in vivo. This strategy could be useful to enhance the therapeutic use of type I interferons in antiviral, antineoplastic, and autoimmune applications.",PMC6985271,PMC6985271_0
"A recent study has identified a new tool to directly study protein-protein interaction within a cellular context, called nanobretâ„¢. This technique allows for monitoring protein-protein interactions involving usp18, STAT2, IFNAR, and ISG15 more closely.",PMC6985271,PMC6985271_1
"Multiple strategies have been proposed to modulate ISG15 function in the immune system. However, the exact mechanism by which the negative regulation of type I IFN by USP18 is precisely mediated is only starting to become clearer in recent years.",PMC6985271,PMC6985271_2
"A recent study has identified five pseudo-torch drugs, called protacs, that can be used to selectively target difficult-to-drug proteins by selectively targeting their degradation through the proteasome. This strategy could be useful to identify suitable compounds for chemical screens to identify new compounds that inhibit USP18 enzymatic activity.",PMC6985271,PMC6985271_3
A recent study has identified a humanized ISG15 mouse model where murine ISG15 is replaced by its human counterpart. This model could shed light on how murine and human ISG15 can target proteins upon infection with different pathogens.,PMC6985271,PMC6985271_4
