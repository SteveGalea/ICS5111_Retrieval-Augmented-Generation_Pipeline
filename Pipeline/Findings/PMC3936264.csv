"In the context of healthcare, a study investigating the congruence between crowdsourced information and official government data in South Korea found that the quality of crowdsourced information on healthcare services varies across regions and can be explained by geospecific demographic factors such as birthrate, educational attainment, population density, and the number of doctors per clinic. This study suggests that governmental efforts should be made to counterbalance the misinformation by disseminating approval ratings of pediatric clinics via geospecific online health communities, especially in regions with the lowest information quality levels.",PMC3936264,PMC3936264_0
"In the context of finance, a study analyzing the returns of investing in small-cap stocks in South Korea during a bull market found that the stock price momentum effect, which refers to the tendency of stocks with high past returns to continue to outperform stocks with low past returns, becomes weaker in the presence of high levels of uncertainty. This finding has practical implications for portfolio managers who should be aware of the potential reversal of the stock price momentum effect in times of high uncertainty, such as during a bear market or in response to a major economic shock.",PMC3936264,PMC3936264_1

"In the context of marketing, a study examining the effects of social media use on consumer decision-making found that consumers who frequently use social media during their decision-making process are more likely to make impulsive purchases and are less sensitive to price discounts compared to consumers who less frequently use social media. This finding has practical implications for marketers who should be aware of the potential impact of social media use on consumer behavior and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly.",PMC3936264,PMC3936264_3
"In the context of psychology, a study investigating the relationship between social media use and self-esteem found that individuals who spend more time on social media tend to report lower levels of self-esteem, possibly due to the potential negative effects of social comparison and social comparison anxiety. This finding has implications for individuals who should be aware of the potential negative effects of excessive social media use on self-esteem and take steps to limit their social media",PMC3936264,PMC3936264_4
