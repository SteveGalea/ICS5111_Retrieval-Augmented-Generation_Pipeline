"A new calicivirus, named Kirklareli virus, was identified in a Turkish outbreak of enteritis in calves, causing 60% disease incidence and 30% mortality.",PMC4609679,PMC4609679_0
"The Kirklareli virus is genetically related to neboviruses, but differs from them in genome organization, with a 1-nt overlap between orf1 and orf2, while members of the nebovirus genus have a 1-nt interval between the two orfs.",PMC4609679,PMC4609679_1
"The Kirklareli virus failed to replicate in vitro, as observed in serial passages and viral replication by RT-PCR, similar to other enteric caliciviruses, except for the porcine sapovirus strain Cowden and murine noroviruses.",PMC4609679,PMC4609679_2
"The Kirklareli virus is distantly related to other bovine enteric caliciviruses, such as neboviruses, with a distinctive genome organization, and its pathogenic properties need to be determined by experimental infections.",PMC4609679,PMC4609679_3
"The Kirklareli virus was detected in 5 of 17 (29.4%) calves in the Kirklareli outbreak, and in 1 additional herd in the Ankara region, suggesting a limited/diverse geographical distribution.",PMC4609679,PMC4609679_4
