The study found that wild hyenas from the Masai Mara in Kenya had significantly higher serum antibody concentrations than hyenas born and raised in a captive facility.,PMC4621877,PMC4621877_0
"The study suggests that environmental and ecological factors are important modulators of the immune response, as the captive hyena population was derived directly from the wild population and has been in captivity for less than four generations.",PMC4621877,PMC4621877_1
"The study found that wild females had higher concentrations of nigg against klh than did wild males, but this difference was not apparent in captive hyenas.",PMC4621877,PMC4621877_2
The study found that both aigg and aigm levels were significantly higher in wild hyenas than in captive hyenas.,PMC4621877,PMC4621877_3
"The study found that variance in immune defenses was similar among captive and wild hyenas, indicating that resource availability or other factors, such as pathogen exposure, may be driving the observed differences in induced immune function.",PMC4621877,PMC4621877_4
