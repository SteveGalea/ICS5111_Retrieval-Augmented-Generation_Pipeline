"The study provides evidence for isolation by distance in the spatial pattern of genetic variation in fox rabies virus variants in southern Ontario, Canada. The analysis reveals a very strong correlation between pair-wise genetic distances and pair-wise geographic distances, indicating a pattern of isolation by distance.",PMC1186024,PMC1186024_0
"The study identifies two distinct viral age groups: one older virus population circulating in the northeast and one younger population circulating in the southwest. The age-distance relationship was computed against a fixed geographic location to define subgroup distances, and within each subgroup, there is a genetic distance-geographic distance relationship.",PMC1186024,PMC1186024_1
"The study suggests that the spatial organization of sequence variants is best explained largely as a consequence of isolation by distance rather than local adaptation. Although the hypothesis of local adaptation generating spatial genetic organization of populations must be evaluated against an appropriate null model based on isolation by distance, the current analysis suggests that approximately 90% of the geographic structure of the Ontario rabies virus population can be attributed to isolation by distance rather than local adaptation.",PMC1186024,PMC1186024_2
"The study provides evidence for the reduction in isolation by distance in the southern region of Ontario due to multiple waves of infection crossing the southern peninsula, but restricted transmission back into the eastern sections of Ontario. This would lead to increased mixing among the southern isolates of the virus and the disruption of isolation by distance.",PMC1186024,PMC1186024_3
"The study suggests that two populations of virus of slightly different age exist on the Ontario peninsula, each showing isolation by distance within their respective endemic regions, indicative of the historical dynamics of fox rabies spread during its decent into southern Ontario. Each population shows reduced isolation by distance within their respective endemic regions.",PMC1186024,PMC1186024_4
