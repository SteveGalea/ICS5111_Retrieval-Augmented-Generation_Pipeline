The common marmoset (C. Jacchus) is a small New World nonhuman primate that is susceptible to SARS-CoV infection and develops pulmonary pathology primarily characterized by a multifocal interstitial pneumonitis with multinucleated syncytial cells and accompanied by a lymphocytic bronchiolitis at early time points.,PMC1603565,PMC1603565_0
"Viral replication has been demonstrated in pulmonary tissue through immunohistochemistry, and viral RNA has been detected in lung tissue samples from all six animals in experiment 2, with concentrations ranging from undetectable (detection threshold values ranging from 2500 to 17,000 copies/g of tissue) to more than 70 times 106 copies/g of tissue (day 4).",PMC1603565,PMC1603565_1
"The common marmoset model for SARS-CoV infection shares features with SARS in humans, including elevations of liver enzymes and hepatic lesions in 11 of 12 animals after inoculation, and a rapid appearance of a random multifocal interstitial hepatitis in infected marmosets.",PMC1603565,PMC1603565_2
"The common marmoset is particularly well suited for defining immunological correlates of disease, as it is susceptible to SARS-CoV infection and develops disease that shares features with SARS in humans, and additional studies are necessary to understand the complete disease course and its manifestations.",PMC1603565,PMC1603565_3
"The common marmoset will serve as a useful surrogate system for assessing treatment efficacy, as critical host determinants of pathogenesis are defined in this animal model, and their relevance to human disease may be better defined as promising preliminary data are reported.",PMC1603565,PMC1603565_4
