"A statistical algorithm called sarima can significantly improve the performance of emr-based influenza surveillance systems by detecting outbreaks more quickly and accurately than traditional methods. This is especially important in the context of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, during which sarima outperformed traditional methods in detecting outbreaks and identifying true-positive alarms.",PMC5791979,PMC5791979_0
"The use of historical data in sarima modeling can improve the timeliness of influenza surveillance, as it allows for the detection of outbreaks more quickly and accurately. This is particularly relevant in the context of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, during which sarima was able to speed up epidemic detection by several days.",PMC5791979,PMC5791979_1
"The use of diagnostic codes and ari symptoms documented in related clinical notes, in conjunction with the emr software, can further improve the performance of sarima-based influenza surveillance systems.",PMC5791979,PMC5791979_2
"The performance of sarima-based systems may be more prone to variations than simpler systems, such as those based on stereotyped emergency room chief-complaints, due to the characteristics of the epidemic, the emr software, and the processes of care that it supports, which can change over time.",PMC5791979,PMC5791979_3
"The empirical approach used to evaluate alternative surveillance systems, as described in this work, may represent a useful blueprint for the growing efforts to harness the emr to benefit public health.",PMC5791979,PMC5791979_4
