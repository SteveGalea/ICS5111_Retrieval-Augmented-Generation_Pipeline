"Two chimeric bovine-human piv3 viruses, rhpiv3-nb and rb/hpiv3, were evaluated for safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in hpiv3-naive children.",PMC3509782,PMC3509782_0
"Rhpiv3-nb and rb/hpiv3 were both highly attenuated and infectious in hpiv3-naive children, but rb/hpiv3 was more restricted in replication and more immunogenic, making it the preferred candidate for further clinical development.",PMC3509782,PMC3509782_1
"The mean peak titer of virus detected in nasal wash fluid was greater for rhpiv3-nb than for rb/hpiv3, but the rb/hpiv3 vaccine underwent greater restriction in replication and induced significantly higher titers of hai antibody than the rhpiv3-nb vaccine.",PMC3509782,PMC3509782_2
"Lri and/or other saes associated with vaccine virus shedding were not observed, and fever and upper respiratory illnesses were frequently detected in both vaccinees and placebo recipients.",PMC3509782,PMC3509782_3
"These types of illnesses often occur in infants and preschoolers and can confound the assessment of reactogenicity of a live-attenuated respiratory virus vaccine, and assessment of the causal relationship between vaccine administration and a mild illness such as rhinorrhea will require studies in larger numbers of children.",PMC3509782,PMC3509782_4
