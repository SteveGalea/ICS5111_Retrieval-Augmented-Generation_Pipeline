"This study reports the identification of seven major clades of the H1N1pdm influenza virus, which have co-circulated globally since April 2009. The clades were detected in at least one Asian country and in the US states of Wisconsin and New York.",PMC2773564,PMC2773564_0
The study found no significant differences in age distribution or clinical severity among the clades or any fixed amino acid changes likely to impact fitness.,PMC2773564,PMC2773564_1
"The study revealed that the clades transmitted successfully in humans, as even the smaller clades were isolated from clinical specimens by inoculating samples onto Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells grown until 95% confluence, stored at -80°C, and that the viral segment DNA was amplified using Accuprime Taq at 35 cycles.",PMC2773564,PMC2773564_2
"The study employed a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method using a strict molecular clock and a GTR+γ4 model of nucleotide substitution, as determined by ModelTest, to infer the evolutionary relationships and timescale for the complete H1N1pdm data set analyzed.",PMC2773564,PMC2773564_3
"The study found that the isolates with the most basal position on the phylogenetic tree, not located within any clade, were used as a basis for comparison to identify amino acid changes. The isolates with the most basal position on the phylogenetic tree, such as A/Mexico/4603/2009(H1N1), were not located within any clade and were used as a basis for comparison.",PMC2773564,PMC2773564_4
