"Viruses have developed strategies to target and manipulate the ubiquitin system, which is a critical component of the innate immune response, as a central immune evasion mechanism.",PMC2939720,PMC2939720_0
"Viral proteins, such as the ns1 protein of influenza B virus and the k5 protein of Kaposi's sarcoma virus, directly ubiquitinate or indirectly target the cellular protein bst2/tetherin, which is an interferon-induced protein that prevents virus egress.",PMC2939720,PMC2939720_1
"The deubiquinating enzyme Ubp43, which is induced by interferon, counteracts the ubiquitination of bst2/tetherin by most viral proteins, highlighting the importance of ubiquitination in viral immune evasion strategies.",PMC2939720,PMC2939720_2
"The identification of novel targets for viral ubiquitin ligases, such as the viral homolog of the membrane-associated ring-ch (MARCH) family of transmembrane ubiquitin ligases, has revealed novel important key elements of host defense pathways.",PMC2939720,PMC2939720_3
"Proteomics approaches have accelerated the identification of novel targets for viral ubiquitin ligases, suggesting that it will be possible to use viral ubiquitin ligases to identify novel important key elements of host defense pathways.",PMC2939720,PMC2939720_4
