A novel method for the capture and stabilization of human chemokine receptor 5 (hcxcr5) on biacore sensor chips was developed. This method involves the use of a limited cross-linking step after initial capture of hcxcr5 using its N-terminal histidine tag.,PMC5154539,PMC5154539_0
"The use of limited cross-linking allows for the stabilization of the hcxcr5 protein on the sensor chip, enabling the repeated capture and analysis of ligands and antibodies binding to hcxcr5 in a triplicate fashion.",PMC5154539,PMC5154539_1
"The method was successfully applied to the capture and stabilization of human chemokine receptor 5 (hcxcr5) on biacore sensor chips, as well as to the capture and stabilization of human CD52 virus-like particles (vlps) full-length CD52 coding sequence.",PMC5154539,PMC5154539_2
"The method allows for the characterization of hcxcr5 ligand and antibody binding in triplicate at concentrations from 0 to 80 nM, using biacore T100 evaluation software.",PMC5154539,PMC5154539_3
"The stabilization of hcxcr5 and CD52 vlps on sensor chips enables the repeated capture and analysis of ligands and antibodies binding to these receptors, facilitating the characterization of their binding interactions.",PMC5154539,PMC5154539_4
