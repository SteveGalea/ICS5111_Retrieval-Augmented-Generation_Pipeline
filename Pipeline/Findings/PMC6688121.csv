"One of the key findings in the section on software packages for phylogenetic tree construction is the development of user-friendly tools such as IQ-Tree and PhyML, which offer a high level of accuracy and speed in constructing maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. These packages also allow for the inclusion of complex molecular clock models and the incorporation of prior information from external sources, such as molecular clock models or biological knowledge.",PMC6688121,PMC6688121_0
"Another important finding is the development of software packages for the analysis and visualization of large-scale molecular sequence alignments, such as MAFFT and TrimAlign, which can handle thousands of sequences and offer high accuracy and speed in alignment construction. These packages also allow for the identification of conserved and variable regions within alignments, which can provide insights into the evolutionary history of the sequences.",PMC6688121,PMC6688121_1
"The section on software packages for phylogenetic placement of missing sequence data highlights the development of tools such as PhyloPlacements and PlaGeM, which can accurately place missing sequence data onto an existing phylogeny using a maximum likelihood approach. These packages also offer visualization options for representing the placement uncertainty, which can provide insights into the reliability of the placement results.",PMC6688121,PMC6688121_2
"The section on software packages for the analysis and visualization of phylogenetic networks and graphs, such as SplitsTree4 and NeXML, highlights the development of tools for the analysis and visualization of complex phylogenetic relationships and networks. These packages also allow for the integration of external data sources, such as clinical and phenotypic information, and offer visualization options for representing the network structure and the associated uncertainty.",PMC6688121,PMC6688121_3
"The section on software packages for the analysis and visualization of phylogenetic trees and networks in real-time, such as Nextstrain and EpiTree, highlights the development of tools for the analysis and visualization of ongoing viral epidemics and outbreaks. These packages offer real-time tracking of viral spread and the identification of transmission clusters, as well as the visualization of the associated uncertainty. They also allow for the integration of external data sources, such as clinical and phenotypic information, and offer visualization options for representing the network structure and the associated uncertainty.",PMC6688121,PMC6688121_4
