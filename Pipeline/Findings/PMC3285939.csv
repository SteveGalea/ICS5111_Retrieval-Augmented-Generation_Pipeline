"In the study by Atkins and coworkers (1998), they introduced a dual-luciferase reporter system based on the natural full-length hiv-1 DNA sequence, which contains a modified 5'-untranslated region (UTR) upstream of the rluc coding sequence and a modified UTR downstream of the fluc coding sequence. The study also involved mutagenesis of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (Cat) coding sequence to CuuuC, which was inserted into the plasmid pdual-hiv(−1), resulting in the generation of a short and unstructured 5'-UTR region.",PMC3285939,PMC3285939_0
"In the study by Dulude and coworkers (2006), they described a transfection system for the generation of total rna from cd4+ jurkat t-cells or hek 293t cells transfected with various plasmid constructs, using the trizol reagent (Invitrogen). They also reported the use of polyethylenimine (pei; polysciences, inc.) as a multilabel tester to analyze the relative frameshift efficiency, as well as the quantification of total rna using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) with 1 μg of total rna as a template.",PMC3285939,PMC3285939_1
"In the study by Gendron and coworkers (1999), they investigated the use of the neon transfection system (Invitrogen) to remove dna from the extract and the generation of a short and unstructured 5'-UTR region in the plasmid pdual-hiv(0). They also reported the use of primers kk and ll (LL) in the generation of a modified UTR downstream of the fluc coding sequence in the dual-luciferase reporter system.",PMC3285939,PMC3285939_2
"In the study by Pedersen and coworkers (1998), they introduced the use of the rluc-fwd: 5'-gctgcccagcaagatcatgagaaa-3' and the rluc-rev: 5'-tgtagttgaggtcaatgaaggg-3' gene-specific primers for the",PMC3285939,PMC3285939_3
