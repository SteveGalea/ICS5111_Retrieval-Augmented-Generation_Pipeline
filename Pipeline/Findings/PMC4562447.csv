"A survey conducted in the UK found that 94% of farmers vaccinated their cattle, but only 66% followed recommended vaccination protocols. Incorrect routes of administration, particularly the use of subcutaneous versus intramuscular injections, were a common issue. The majority of farmers administered vaccines within the recommended timeframe on the datasheets, but vaccine failure can occur if vaccination occurs below the recommended first age of vaccination or if a second dose within a primary course is not administered within the recommended time period. The veterinarian was the main vaccine supplier and source of information on vaccines.",PMC4562447,PMC4562447_0
"The survey found that economic factors, such as vaccine cost and increased production profits, were the main motivators and barriers for farmers when deciding whether to vaccinate. Only 48% of farmers administered a second dose within the recommended timeframe on the datasheets for the second dose within a primary course. The survey found that understanding farmer motivators and barriers for vaccination could improve adherence to recommended vaccination strategies and reduce vaccine failure on farms.",PMC4562447,PMC4562447_1
"The survey found that the veterinarian was the main vaccine supplier and also the preferred source of information for many respondents in this study, but only 66% of respondents had discussions about vaccine use with their supplier. The survey found that vaccines were available from agricultural merchants and internet pharmacies, but only 93% of respondents bought their vaccines from a veterinarian, highlighting the potential opportunity for the veterinarian to combine their role as supplier with their role as advisor about vaccination.",PMC4562447,PMC4562447_2
"The survey found that only 86% of farmers vaccinated cattle within the recommended timeframe on the datasheets for first vaccinations. The survey found that a study in human patients demonstrated that the same vaccine is immunogenic regardless of whether it is injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly for other veterinary medicines, such as ivermectin and ceftiofur sodium, the efficacy of the drug was not deemed to be different when using intramuscular versus subcutaneous routes of administration.",PMC4562447,PMC4562447_3
"The survey found that understanding farmer motivators and barriers for vaccination could improve adherence to recommended vaccination strategies and reduce vaccine failure on farms. The survey found that veterinarians rarely carried out vaccination on farms, as",PMC4562447,PMC4562447_4
