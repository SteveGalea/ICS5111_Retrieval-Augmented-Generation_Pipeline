The study found that 21% of cats in northeastern China had evidence of previous infection with pandemic (h1n1) 2009 virus based on nt. This prevalence is higher than that reported in a similar study conducted in southern China in 2011 (1.2%). The study suggests that cats in northeastern China may have been at a higher probability of infection with pandemic (h1n1) 2009 due to their exposure to high influenza a (h1n1) pdm09 attack rates in dense human populations.,PMC3995557,PMC3995557_0
The study found that male cats may be more susceptible to pandemic (h1n1) 2009 infections than female cats (p < 0.05).,PMC3995557,PMC3995557_1
"The study found that cats in northeastern China had a higher prevalence of pandemic (h1n1) 2009 infection than cats in southern China. However, the study notes that the temporal difference between cats sampled in northeastern China and southern China in 2011 may also contribute to this difference.",PMC3995557,PMC3995557_2
The study found that cats in northeastern China had a higher prevalence of pandemic (h1n1) 2009 infection in pet cats compared to roaming cats (p = 0.0032). This suggests a potential transmission of the virus between infected owners and their pets by close contact.,PMC3995557,PMC3995557_3
"The study notes that 240 samples from two small animal shelters in Harbin and Changchun had evidence of previous infection with pandemic (h1n1) 2009 before sample collection, which may contribute to the sustained transmission of the virus in the human population in the study area.",PMC3995557,PMC3995557_4
