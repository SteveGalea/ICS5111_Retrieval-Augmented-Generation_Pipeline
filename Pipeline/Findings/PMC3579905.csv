"This study found that vaccination against influenza increases the expression of the regulatory T cell (Treg) marker, Foxp3, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy volunteers.",PMC3579905,PMC3579905_0
"The study also revealed that vaccination leads to an increase in the antibody titers against the influenza A (H1N1) virus and the influenza B virus, as well as an increase in the production of cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-γ, in the plasma of the vaccinated individuals.",PMC3579905,PMC3579905_1
"The study found that the expression of the Treg marker, Foxp3, in CD4+CD25+ PBMCs is associated with an increased production of IL-10, a cytokine that is known to suppress inflammation.",PMC3579905,PMC3579905_2
"The study also found that the expression of CD127, another Treg marker, was increased in PBMCs after vaccination, suggesting an increase in Treg cells.",PMC3579905,PMC3579905_3
"The study noted that the expression of CD127 and Foxp3 in Treg cells was associated with an increase in the production of IL-10 and a decrease in the production of IFN-γ, which is associated with Th1 cells and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.",PMC3579905,PMC3579905_4
