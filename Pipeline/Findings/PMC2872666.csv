The study reports on three severely ill patients infected with the H1N1/09 virus.,PMC2872666,PMC2872666_0
"Patient 1, who was pregnant, had rapid disease progression and died, despite administration of betamethasone and hydrocortisone.",PMC2872666,PMC2872666_1
"Patient 1 had peripheral lymphopaenia, but no evidence of neutrophilic infiltrate in the lungs, suggesting primary viral pneumonia.",PMC2872666,PMC2872666_2
"Patient 1 had a complete loss of NK cells in the peripheral blood, which could have contributed to her increased susceptibility to severe disease.",PMC2872666,PMC2872666_3
"Patient 3, who was also infected with H1N1/09, had a reduced number of NK cells in the peripheral blood, but still had some circulating antigen-specific T cells, suggesting a more sizeable population of antigen-specific T cells in some patients infected with H1N1/09.",PMC2872666,PMC2872666_4
"The study highlights the potential role of NK cells in controlling virus load and dissemination during a first encounter with a new virus, and the possibility of genetic polymorphisms affecting NK frequency or function.",PMC2872666,PMC2872666_5
"The study also provides insights into the clinical presentation, radiological findings, and histopathological features of H1N1/09 infection, as well as the immunological profile of infected patients.",PMC2872666,PMC2872666_6
"The study highlights the importance of genetic polymorphisms affecting immune function during infection, as well as the potential role of NK cells in controlling virus load and dissemination.",PMC2872666,PMC2872666_7
The study suggests that nK cell depletion or mice lacking the full repertoire of NK cell recognition receptors (NCR-1 deficient mice) exhibited increased morbidity and mortality following influenza A virus infection.,PMC2872666,PMC2872666_8
