"A study by Kollef et al. Found that patients with health-care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) have a similar severity of illness to those with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but a lower mortality rate. HCAP is distinct from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and should be treated as a hospital-acquired infection from the outset.",PMC1550845,PMC1550845_0
"Lacherade et al. Found that the mode of respiratory gas humidification does not affect the incidence of VAP, as both heated humidifiers and heat and moisture exchangers were equally effective in preventing VAP in patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.",PMC1550845,PMC1550845_1
"Brun-Buisson et al. Demonstrated that bronchoscopic aspiration is the most effective method for diagnosing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with fewer false positives compared to blinded endotracheal aspiration or blinded protected telescoping aspiration (PTC). PTC is a close second in terms of effectiveness.",PMC1550845,PMC1550845_2
"A study by Brigham et al. Found that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an effective alternative to conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) for patients with acute respiratory failure from all causes, with a lower mortality rate and comparable complication rates and duration of ventilation.",PMC1550845,PMC1550845_3
"Two studies, by McDonald et al. And by a research group in Quebec, have identified a previously uncommon strain of Clostridio difficile (C. Difficile) that has markedly increased in incidence, with increased severity and prevalence of disease. This strain is characterized by the production of a new toxin (binary toxin) and a partial deletion of the tcdC gene, which normally downregulates toxin A and B production, as well as increased resistance to fluoroquinolones. The emergence of this strain is a cause for concern, and continued microbiological surveillance, early diagnosis and treatment, scrupulous infection control practice, and regular institutional review of antimicrobial stewardship are essential to combat it.",PMC1550845,PMC1550845_4
