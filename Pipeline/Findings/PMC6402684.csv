"The phylogenetic analysis of pedv viruses during the 2014 outbreak in Taiwan revealed that most of the identified viruses were independent, despite sharing a common ancestor. This suggests multiple pedv invasions from abroad in Taiwan and highlights the need for enhanced biosecurity measures to prevent future outbreaks.",PMC6402684,PMC6402684_0
"The study used a combination of phylogeographic and GIS approaches to profile the pedv outbreak in Taiwan. GIS was used to identify factors associated with the number of pedv cases, including positive correlations between the number of cases and both slaughterhouse number and pig farm size, and a negative correlation with the number of feed mills.",PMC6402684,PMC6402684_1
The study found that the highest concentration of pedv cases was identified in a multi-county section of southern Taiwan characterized by a large number of pig farms with high animal densities. This suggests that excessive farm capacity is a risk factor for the spread of pedv and highlights the need for greater effort to monitor potential transmission routes.,PMC6402684,PMC6402684_2
"The study identified a clear need to collect more data on feed truck routes, sdpp supplement distribution, rendering plant procedures, and slaughterhouse processes to identify the sources of various strains in Taiwan.",PMC6402684,PMC6402684_3
"The study's findings regarding the negative correlation between pedv cases and the number of feed mills suggest that pig farms at the end of feed routes have higher probabilities of infections, and improper disposal procedures when pig corpses are collected and sent to rendering plants may increase the potential for pedv due to feedbag contamination. This underscores the importance of enhancing biosecurity measures in these areas to prevent future outbreaks.",PMC6402684,PMC6402684_4
