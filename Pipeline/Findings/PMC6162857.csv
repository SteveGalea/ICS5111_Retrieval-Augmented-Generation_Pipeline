"A study by Zhu et al. (2018) found that neutrophil elastase (NE) activity is increased in smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and inhibition of NE by the small molecule inhibitor sivelestat significantly reduced emphysematous changes in a mouse model of COPD (Zhu et al., 2018).",PMC6162857,PMC6162857_0
"A review by Chen et al. (2019) highlighted the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in COPD pathogenesis, with MMP12 and MMP14 identified as key mediators of emphysematous changes in COPD (Chen et al., 2019).",PMC6162857,PMC6162857_1
