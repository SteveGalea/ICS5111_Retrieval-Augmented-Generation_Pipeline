"The discovery of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 has led to over 2,500 reported cases and a mortality rate exceeding 35%. This is higher than the mortality rate seen during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which disappeared within a year.",PMC5850400,PMC5850400_0
"The MERS-CoV epidemic has persisted for over three years, suggesting that it is periodically introduced into human populations and may cause severe disease in patients with underlying medical conditions.",PMC5850400,PMC5850400_1
"The pattern of MERS-CoV lineages is more consistent with the movement of infected livestock or animal products, increasing the risk for future pandemics.",PMC5850400,PMC5850400_2
Population-based studies are needed to determine the involvement of MERS-CoV in other body systems and to clarify the chain of MERS-CoV zoonotic transmissions.,PMC5850400,PMC5850400_3
"The development of MERS-CoV full-length infectious clones allows for the systematic experimental study of the roles of the various corresponding MERS-CoV proteins, which should lead to a better understanding of the role of the viral genes in infectivity and pathogenicity. This manipulation of the virus genome also provides a reverse genetics platform that could lead to the future development of MERS-CoV-based vector vaccines.",PMC5850400,PMC5850400_4
