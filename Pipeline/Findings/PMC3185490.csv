"The viral protein bicp0 plays dual roles during infection of cattle: it stimulates viral transcription and inhibits innate immune responses. Bicp0 can also interact with cellular regulatory factors, such as histone deacetylase 1, histone acetyl transferase p300, and interferon regulatory factor 7. The specific cellular proteins that are targets for proteasomal degradation induced by bicp0 have not been identified.",PMC3185490,PMC3185490_0
"The viral protein ul49.5 inhibits cd8+ t cell recognition of infected cells by inhibiting chemokine-gag interactions, which disrupts chemokine gradients and inhibits immune cell migration. This mechanism is an important one by which the virus evades immune responses.",PMC3185490,PMC3185490_1
"The viral encoded chemokine, gg, inhibits chemokine activity by preventing chemokine-gag interactions, which also disrupts chemokine gradients and inhibits immune cell migration. This mechanism is also important for immune evasion.",PMC3185490,PMC3185490_2
"The viral protein bovine herpesvirus 1 gg is a viral immune evasion gene because it inhibits immune cell migration by preventing chemokine-gag interactions. Gg can also interact with bid and cdc42, which are b-cell and monocyte-activating chemokine precursors.",PMC3185490,PMC3185490_3
"The viral protein bovine herpesvirus 1 gg inhibits cell growth, possibly by encoding a small regulatory rna that may act as a micro-rna. The ability of viruses to inhibit innate immune responses dictates host range, the pathogenic potential of a virus, and the ability of a given virus to survive in nature.",PMC3185490,PMC3185490_4
