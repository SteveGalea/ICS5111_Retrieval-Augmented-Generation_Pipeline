The current study focused on kinases in the translation pathway as a leverage point to fight RVFV due to the robust phosphorylation of key players in translation observed in RVFV infected cells.,PMC5923485,PMC5923485_0
"Inhibition of translation through kinase inhibitors, such as rapamycin, can be a safe and effective antiviral strategy, as demonstrated by the current study's use of rapamycin to suppress RVFV replication.",PMC5923485,PMC5923485_1
"The study's analysis of RVFV-infected cells revealed that RVFV hijacks the translation pathway to facilitate its replication, and inhibition of translation, through kinase inhibitors, allows for a more robust viral inhibition.",PMC5923485,PMC5923485_2
"The study's findings suggest that targeting multiple key kinases within the translational pathway, such as the combined use of inhibitors to suppress viral replication, allows for the most robust viral inhibition.",PMC5923485,PMC5923485_3
"The study's use of host-based therapeutics, such as kinase inhibitors, to fight RVFV infection, is a current strategy being explored due to the importance of the translational pathway in many cellular events, including cell cycle regulation, cell survival, transcription, and innate immune responses.",PMC5923485,PMC5923485_4
