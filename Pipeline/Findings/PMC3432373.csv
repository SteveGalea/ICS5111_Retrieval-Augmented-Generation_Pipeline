"Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), are found in patients with enterovirus 71 brain stem encephalitis (EV71-BE) and are associated with disease severity, including pulmonary edema (PE) and autonomic nervous system dysregulation (ANS DYSREGULATION).",PMC3432373,PMC3432373_0
"High levels of IL-13, a neutrophil-specific chemotactic factor, are also observed in patients with PE and ANS DYSREGULATION, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of these conditions.",PMC3432373,PMC3432373_1
"Treatment with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and milrinone, a bipyridine phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, can lead to a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, and IFN-γ, in patients with EV71-BE and ANS DYSREGULATION.",PMC3432373,PMC3432373_2
"Blood purification, utilizing mechanisms such as convection, diffusion, and adsorption, may also be a useful approach for controlling hypercytokinemia in patients with severe EV71 infection.",PMC3432373,PMC3432373_3
"The appropriate timing and duration of intervention, as well as the possible clinical effectiveness of these approaches, should be taken into consideration in severe EV71-infected patients.",PMC3432373,PMC3432373_4
