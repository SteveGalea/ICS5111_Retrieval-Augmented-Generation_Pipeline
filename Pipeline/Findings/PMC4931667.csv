"Vimentin interacts with Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. Coli and Salmonella, to recognize and mediate innate immune signaling. In E. Coli, vimentin acts as a surface-attached receptor of aiec, an intestinal pathogen, and as a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (Nod2)-interacting protein, an intracellular PRR, recognizing bacterial peptidoglycan fragments. In Salmonella, vimentin is recruited to the membrane ruffles stimulated by the pathogen and mediates map kinase activation via the tyrosine phosphatase domain of SptP, an effector protein of Salmonella that is secreted via the type III secretion system.",PMC4931667,PMC4931667_0
"Vimentin is a component of the cytoskeleton and is remodeled by the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis to form a dynamic scaffold that provides structural stability to the inclusion. The pathogen utilizes the virulence factor Cpaf, an important factor for the full replicative potential of C. Trachomatis, to modify and disassemble the vimentin scaffold.",PMC4931667,PMC4931667_1
"Vimentin interacts with Gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In Streptococcus pyogenes, vimentin is upregulated on injured skeletal-muscle cells and is targeted by the bacterial toxin Spya, a C3 family adp-ribosyltransferase. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, vimentin is downregulated in macrophages compared to infections with an avirulent M. Tuberculosis strain, and the bacterial protein Microaggregate-binding protein 1 (Mbp-1) induces vimentin polymerization at the site of the bacterium-host cell interface.",PMC4931667,PMC4931667_2
"Vimentin interacts with Viruses, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). In SARS-CoV, vimentin serves as a",PMC4931667,PMC4931667_3
