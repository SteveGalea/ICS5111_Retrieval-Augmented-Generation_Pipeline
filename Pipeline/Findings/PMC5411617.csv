"The study identified two cleavage sites in porcine stat2, E169 and K177, and demonstrated that pdcov nsp5 specifically cleaves at these sites, leading to a decrease in the stability and translation of stat2 mRNA.",PMC5411617,PMC5411617_0
"The study found that pdcov nsp5 can antagonize type I interferon (IFN) signaling by cleaving both the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 and ISG54 promoters, leading to a decrease in IFN-stimulated gene expression.",PMC5411617,PMC5411617_1
"The study showed that pdcov nsp5 can also antagonize IFN signaling by cleaving stat2, resulting in a decrease in the activation of ISRE, a key component of the IFN-stimulated response element.",PMC5411617,PMC5411617_2
"The study found that pdcov nsp5 can cleave both full-length stat2 and its deletion mutant, indicating that pdcov nsp5 can target stat2 regardless of its deletion mutation.",PMC5411617,PMC5411617_3
"The study demonstrated that pdcov nsp5 can antagonize IFN signaling by cleaving stat2, leading to a decrease in the activation of ISG15, ISG54, ISG56, and OAS1, which are critical genes in the IFN-stimulated response.",PMC5411617,PMC5411617_4
