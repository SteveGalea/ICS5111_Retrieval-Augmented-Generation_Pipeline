"Lymphopenia-induced homeostatic proliferation leads to a reduction in CD4 T cells, which is associated with a narrowed T cell repertoire.",PMC2481550,PMC2481550_0
"The narrowed T cell repertoire in lymphopenic hosts can impair heterologous immune responses to secondary viral challenges, as demonstrated by reduced CD8 T cell responses to the normally immunodominant but not cross-reactive pv NP-38 epitope in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-immune hosts challenged with poxvirus (PV).",PMC2481550,PMC2481550_1
"The narrowed T cell repertoire in lymphopenic hosts can lead to altered T cell usage of heterologous virus-encoded epitopes, as shown by the predominant use of Vbeta5.1/5.2-positive T cells in heterologous immune responses to secondary PV challenges in lcmv-immune hosts.",PMC2481550,PMC2481550_2
"Despite the narrowed T cell repertoire, lymphopenic hosts can mount effective CD8 T cell responses against both primary and secondary viral challenges, as demonstrated by the restoration of CD8 T cell numbers to normal levels after lcmv infection in lymphopenic hosts.",PMC2481550,PMC2481550_3
"The effect of a narrowed immune repertoire occurring as a consequence of homeostatic proliferation may be of greater significance in older persons in whom the thymus is functioning poorly, as the host experiences infections with additional viruses due to reduced thymic output.",PMC2481550,PMC2481550_4
