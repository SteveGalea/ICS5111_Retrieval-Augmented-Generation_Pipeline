This study investigated the susceptibility of the reproductive tract of different bird species to influenza A (H9N2 and H6N8) and H7N9 viruses using the oviduct explant model.,PMC5518544,PMC5518544_0
"The study found that moc-du, derived from immature duck oviducts, were less susceptible to productive infection with H9N2 and H6N8 compared to moc-ch and moc-tu, derived from immature chicken and turkey oviducts, respectively.",PMC5518544,PMC5518544_1
"The study also found that H9N2 infection in moc-ch and moc-tu led to a significant upregulation of interferon lambda (IFNL) mRNA expression compared to virus-free controls, but only ph1N1-infected moc-tu demonstrated a significant increase in IFNL mRNA expression at 48 hours post infection compared to the virus-free controls.",PMC5518544,PMC5518544_2
"The study demonstrated differences in the expression of α2,3 and α2,6 sialic acids, which are important receptors of influenza viruses, between species and subsequently a different replication level of H9N2 and H6N8 in moc-ch and moc-tu.",PMC5518544,PMC5518544_3
"The study found that H9N2 and H6N8 viruses replicated to high levels in moc-ch and moc-tu, but the susceptibility of the reproductive tract for iav between different bird species varied significantly, and the infecting strain/subtype may influence the infection outcome.",PMC5518544,PMC5518544_4
