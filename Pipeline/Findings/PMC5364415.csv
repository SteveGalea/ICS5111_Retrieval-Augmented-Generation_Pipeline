This study demonstrates that the cellular protein hnrnp A2/B1 enhances HIV-1 transcription by unfolding LTR promoter G-quadruplex structures.,PMC5364415,PMC5364415_0
The study shows that hnrnp A2/B1 binding to LTR G-quadruplex structures leads to increased HIV-1 transcription through a mechanism involving the protein's unfolding activity.,PMC5364415,PMC5364415_1
"The study reveals that hnrnp A2/B1 binding to LTR G-quadruplex structures is necessary for optimal HIV-1 transcription, as knockdown of hnrnp A2/B1 in HIV-1-infected cells results in reduced viral transcription.",PMC5364415,PMC5364415_2
The study identifies a novel function for hnrnp A2/B1 in regulating HIV-1 transcription through its unfolding activity.,PMC5364415,PMC5364415_3
"The study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms by which HIV-1 is able to establish a stable infection in host cells, and may have implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches for HIV-1 treatment.",PMC5364415,PMC5364415_4
