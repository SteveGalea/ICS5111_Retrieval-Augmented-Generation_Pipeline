"Emodin, derived from herbal medicine, exhibits antiviral effects against enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex virus, human cytomegalovirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, through casein kinase 2 inhibition, phospholipid bilayer disruption, and ul12 alkaline nuclease activity inhibition (Barnard et al., 1992; Yim et al., 1999; Alves et al., 2004; Dang et al., 2006; Ho et al., 2007).",PMC2538697,PMC2538697_0
"Emodin, at a concentration of 21.5 µm, significantly reduces herpes simplex virus yields in Vero cells without cytotoxic effects, and serum profiles after oral administration of emodin in mice show a peak serum concentration of 700 µm at a dosage of 2 g kg−1 (Barnard et al., 1992; Yim et al., 1999; Alves et al., 2004; Ho et al., 2007; Mengs et al., 1997).",PMC2538697,PMC2538697_1
"Emodin interacts with herpes simplex virus ul12 alkaline nuclease via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with amino acid residues, such as Asp-227, Trp-231, Val-273, Asp-340, Glu-364, and Lys-366, which are critical for catalysis (Liu et al., 2003).",PMC2538697,PMC2538697_2
"Emodin at a concentration of 21.5 µm reduces herpes simplex virus yields in Vero cells, and docking analysis shows that emodin docks into ul12 but not into bovine pancreatic DNase I (data not shown) (Liu et al., 2003).",PMC2538697,PMC2538697_3
"The inhibition of ul12 alkaline nuclease activity by emodin may explain why emodin reduces herpes simplex virus yields in Vero cells, as some of these amino acid residues may",PMC2538697,PMC2538697_4
