"The study describes a simple and relatively unbiased amplification procedure, called 'round abc', to concurrently profile variants of tmprss2:erg fusion transcripts in a complex sample. This methodology has been widely adopted for chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip), whole-genome dna microarrays (chip-chip), and virochip (25,34) experiments, and has been used in the past to obtain 83% (25 kb/30 kb) of the sars coronavirus genome with total nucleic acids isolated from a viral culture (25).",PMC2582611,PMC2582611_0
"The study reports a modification of the 'round abc' protocol, which was originally designed for genomic amplification and has been used to obtain 83% (25 kb/30 kb) of the sars coronavirus genome with total nucleic acids isolated from a viral culture (25). The current assay should facilitate a thorough compilation of the gene fusion variants in primary prostate specimens, which may be useful for stratifying the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.",PMC2582611,PMC2582611_1
"The study reports a tmprss2:erg fusion assay with a sensitivity of detecting 1600 vcap cells, an equivalent to 1-3 cells. This level of sensitivity might not be sufficient for broad clinical application, especially with small biopsy specimens or urine samples. The same strategy can be applied to other fusion genes, such as bcr-abl in cml and clonal ig/tcr rearrangements in lymphocytic malignancies.",PMC2582611,PMC2582611_2
"The study reports that while fish is useful for identifying genomic rearrangements, it has relatively lower resolution and is difficult to use in highly heterogeneous samples with small percentages of tumor cells. The dna-based assay will provide information about whether multiple fusion transcripts in a sample are derived from alternative splicing or tumor heterogeneity. The best approach may ultimately be to combine dna and rna based assays in a common format.",PMC2582611,PMC2582611_3
"The study reports that the fish experiments revealed no genomic deletions at this location for all the selected samples (#5, #7, #9, #19 and #20) that were similarly nondeleted by array. This finding suggests that",PMC2582611,PMC2582611_4
