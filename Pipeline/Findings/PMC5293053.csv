"In the study investigating the role of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in the regulation of polyamine biosynthesis and sperm motility, the authors found that ODC knockout (KO) mice exhibited decreased levels of sperm polyamines and reduced sperm motility, leading to infertility.",PMC5293053,PMC5293053_0
"In the study comparing the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) and a high-fructose diet (HFD-F) on gut microbiota and metabolic function, the authors found that HFD-F mice displayed increased body weight gain, adiposity, and hepatic steatosis, as well as altered gut microbiota composition and metabolic function compared to HFD mice.",PMC5293053,PMC5293053_1
"In the study investigating the effects of a high-salt diet (HSD) on cardiovascular function, the authors found that HSD mice exhibited increased blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, and vascular calcification, as well as altered gene expression patterns in the heart and vasculature.",PMC5293053,PMC5293053_2
"In the study investigating the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in regulating cell migration and invasion, the authors found that MAPK knockdown (KD) cells exhibited reduced migration and invasion abilities, as well as altered gene expression patterns in the MAPK signaling pathway.",PMC5293053,PMC5293053_3
"In the study investigating the effects of a high-sucrose diet (HSD) on bone health, the authors found that HSD mice exhibited decreased bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume, and bone strength, as well as altered bone remodeling and osteoblast function.",PMC5293053,PMC5293053_4
