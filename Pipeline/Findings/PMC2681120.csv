"The study in Kenya found that 19% of bat fecal samples were positive for coronaviruses, with 39 distinct sequences identified.",PMC2681120,PMC2681120_0
"The phylogenetic analysis revealed that bat coronaviruses in Kenya can be classified into two major groups (1 and 2), with the majority belonging to group 1.",PMC2681120,PMC2681120_1
"The study demonstrated that some bat species carry multiple distinct coronaviruses, as seen in chaerophon spp. Miniopterus inflatus, and Rousettus aegyptiacus bats.",PMC2681120,PMC2681120_2
"The findings suggest that some coronaviruses, such as those in the btcov1a-like and bthku8-like clusters, are specifically adapted to Miniopterus spp. Bats and not easily transmitted to other bat species.",PMC2681120,PMC2681120_3
"The study highlights the importance of bats as a source for the introduction of coronaviruses into other species globally, emphasizing the need for increased understanding of the extent and diversity of coronavirus infection in bats.",PMC2681120,PMC2681120_4
