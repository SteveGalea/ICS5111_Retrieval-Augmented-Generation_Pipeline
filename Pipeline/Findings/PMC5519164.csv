"In a simulation study investigating the role of the fomite route in the transmission of SARS-CoV infection, the results showed that for most of the routine round patterns, SARS-CoV was less probable to transmit via the fomite route alone. However, it was more probable that the virus could transmit in combined routes, especially when the viral loads and dose-response parameters were relatively small.",PMC5519164,PMC5519164_0
"The study found that the virus might have spread via the long-range airborne route alone, but it was more probable that the virus could transmit in combined routes, especially when the viral loads and dose-response parameters were relatively small.",PMC5519164,PMC5519164_1
"The study revealed that the index patient was very probable to generate more viruses than ordinary SARS patients, which supported the perception that the patient was a super-spreader.",PMC5519164,PMC5519164_2
"The study showed that for most patterns, the airborne route was predominant.",PMC5519164,PMC5519164_3
The study identified that doctors and nurses were found to be the most possible to conduct their routine rounds following pattern 5 (examining inpatients randomly in the clockwise direction).,PMC5519164,PMC5519164_4
