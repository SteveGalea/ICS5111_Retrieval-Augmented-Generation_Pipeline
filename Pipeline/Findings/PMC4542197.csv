"The 1977 influenza epidemic has been attributed to various explanations over time, including deliberate release, vaccine trials or challenges, and laboratory accidents.",PMC4542197,PMC4542197_0
"Historical and epidemiological aspects of the 1977 influenza epidemic suggest that it could have been caused by deliberate release, as the Soviet Union employed tens of thousands of scientists to make biological weapons, and influenza was considered to be an incapacitating agent, especially to those without previous exposure to a specific virus strain.",PMC4542197,PMC4542197_1
"The epidemiological investigation at military academies revealed no link to other outbreaks nor a temporal association between the onset of cases and athletic competitions with other institutions with influenza cases, but the outbreak at the US Air Force Academy in Colorado in February 1978 was so severe that all academic and military training was suspended.",PMC4542197,PMC4542197_2
"Between 1962 and 1973, almost 40,000 children participated in eight live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) trials in the Soviet Union, and scientists at the Peking Vaccine and Serum Institute in China also carried out clinical trials using LAIV during the same time period.",PMC4542197,PMC4542197_3
"Between 1962 and 1973, almost 40,000 children participated in eight live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) trials in the Soviet Union, and scientists at the Peking Vaccine and Serum Institute in China also carried out clinical trials using LAIV during the same time period. The possibility that the 1977-1978 strain resulted from vaccine challenge or trials is supported by the fact that LAIV research was extensive at the time, and a comparison of all 1977 strains shows a higher prevalence of the ts phenotype than in 1950 strains, suggesting that the outbreak may have resulted from attempts at attenuation for vaccine purposes.",PMC4542197,PMC4542197_4
