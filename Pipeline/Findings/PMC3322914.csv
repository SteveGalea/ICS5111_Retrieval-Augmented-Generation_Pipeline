"Findings: The patient's chest radiograph showed persistent bilateral lower zone consolidation. She had mild dysphagia and required thickened fluids and blended diet without nasogastric feeding. Her blood pressure was 124/84 mm Hg, and her pulse rate was 96 beats per minute. Her pulse oximetry was 100% while on 4 l per minute of intranasal oxygen. Her jugular venous pressure was not elevated.",PMC3322914,PMC3322914_1
"Findings: The patient's condition improved after being admitted to the medical department, but she subsequently became breathless with nausea and vomiting. She had bilateral basal crepitations on examination, and all healthcare workers attending to her in the isolation room wore recommended personal protective equipment. Her leukocyte count was 7,200/mm3 (86.3% polymorphs, 8.6% lymphocytes), and her platelet count was 304,000/mm3. Her chest radiograph showed infiltrates in the right lower zone, and her urine, sputum, and blood cultures did not yield any bacterial growth.",PMC3322914,PMC3322914_2
"Findings: The patient's condition deteriorated, and she was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. She required intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole and was transferred to the geriatric unit. Her condition improved, but she later became more breathless and had congestive cardiac failure. Her repeat chest radiograph showed congestive cardiac failure, and she required intravenous diuretic therapy but was not intubated or moved to intensive care. She died of pneumonia, with a contributing factor of ischemic heart disease.",PMC3322914,PMC3322914_3
