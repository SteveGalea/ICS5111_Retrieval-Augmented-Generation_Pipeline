"Bats are a diverse and ecologically rich mammalian group with over 1,400 described species, making them an attractive choice to investigate microbiome evolution across closely related species with different ecologies.",PMC6147128,PMC6147128_0
"Bats provide a potential solution to the issue of dietary influence on microbiome evolution, as several feeding modes have evolved in parallel two or more times within the order, allowing for the assessment of whether specialization on fruit proceeded via the same bacterial taxa or functions in these divergent host lineages.",PMC6147128,PMC6147128_1
"Understanding the microbiomes of bats can help shed light on their ability to carry out important ecosystem functions, such as insect pest control and pollination, and can highlight potential dangers posed by rapid habitat destruction.",PMC6147128,PMC6147128_2
"Bat microbes can shed light on disease, immunity, and longevity, as bats are increasingly recognized as important components of zoonotic disease cycles and genomic insights have generated plausible explanations for how bats may have evolved to harbor such deadly microbes.",PMC6147128,PMC6147128_3
"Bat microbiomes can be used to understand the links between the microbiome and the evolution of other phenomena of interest, such as immunity and longevity, as bats are exceptionally long-lived for a mammal of their size and many are philopatric to particular roosts, making repeat sampling of individuals throughout their lifetimes possible.",PMC6147128,PMC6147128_4
