"The multicenter, prospective, and exploratory study involving 50 t2d patients with biopsy-proven nafld demonstrated that 65% of patients responded to lobeglitazone treatment, which is comparable to the 69% improvement in steatosis observed in a previous randomized clinical trial (PIVENS) involving non-diabetic patients with nafld.",PMC5143300,PMC5143300_0
"Cap, a simple and non-invasive tool for quantifying and monitoring liver fat content, was used to assess changes in liver fat during intervention, and cap measurements conducted by five centers were included in the study.",PMC5143300,PMC5143300_1
"The study found that patients treated with metformin and lobeglitazone showed a greater reduction in hepatic fat than patients treated with lobeglitazone alone, and increased steatosis grade and metformin use in patients at baseline, as well as decreased alt and lsm levels after treatment, were all reliable factors in predicting responsiveness to lobeglitazone.",PMC5143300,PMC5143300_2
"The study identified several parameters that may be used to predict nafld-patient response to lobeglitazone treatment, including increased steatosis grade and metformin use in patients at baseline, as well as decreased alt and lsm levels after treatment.",PMC5143300,PMC5143300_3
"The study showed that lobeglitazone treatment in nafld patients with t2d improved hepatic steatosis, as assessed by cap, and liver enzyme profiles, as assessed by aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels, but did not affect liver fibrosis, based on measurements of liver stiffness.",PMC5143300,PMC5143300_4
