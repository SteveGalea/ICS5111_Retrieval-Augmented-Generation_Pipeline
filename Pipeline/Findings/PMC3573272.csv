"Viral proteins can disrupt every step of the type I interferon response, from virus entry to antiviral gene expression and function.",PMC3573272,PMC3573272_0
"Some viruses, such as the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), directly induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to their advantage, while others, such as rotavirus, exploit the negative feedback loop of the interferon response to promote viral replication.",PMC3573272,PMC3573272_1
"Viruses can target specific ISGs, such as the immediate-early 1 (IE1) protein of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), which down-regulates ISG16 expression, or the 76000 molecular weight MXA ISG, which associates with virion components and nuclear viral replication compartments to enhance virus replication.",PMC3573272,PMC3573272_2
"The viral protein VM25 of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) re-localizes the ISG VIPERIN to mitochondria, where it disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and enhances viral infection.",PMC3573272,PMC3573272_3
"Rotavirus infection of intestinal epithelial cells leads to a strong induction of the type I interferon response, but instead of limiting virus growth, IFN signaling promotes rotavirus replication, particularly at the early stages. The proposed mechanism is that type I IFN increases PKR levels, which the virus somehow exploits for its own replication.",PMC3573272,PMC3573272_4
