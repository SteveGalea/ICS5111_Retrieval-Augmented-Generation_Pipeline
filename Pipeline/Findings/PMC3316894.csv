"A meta-analysis of 14 rnai screens for influenza virus identified a core set of 138 host genes and pathways that are coopted by the virus to facilitate replication. These findings highlight the importance of influenza virus coopting host genes late during virus replication and suggest that viral proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm, requiring host mechanisms to import np and rna polymerases back into the nucleus to form new vrnp.",PMC3316894,PMC3316894_0
"The study also showed that host factors linked with regulating cell death are affected by influenza virus, a feature likely required to facilitate replication.",PMC3316894,PMC3316894_1
The authors emphasize the need for novel solutions to accelerate the development of virus intervention strategies due to the importance of influenza virus to global human and animal health and the current limitations associated with vaccine production and antiviral therapeutic pipelines.,PMC3316894,PMC3316894_2
"The authors suggest that genome-wide rnai screening is an emerging technology with the power to detail host-virus interactions, furthering our understanding of virus pathogenesis and driving the development of next-generation antivirals.",PMC3316894,PMC3316894_3
"The authors highlight the importance of collaboration in this research arena, citing examples of how scientific consortia and centers composed of dispersed networks of laboratories have successfully worked together to achieve significant goals, such as the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Centers for Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance and the Human Genome Project. They suggest that such collaborative initiatives promote the development of data standards and best practices that facilitate the comparison of data from complementary screens, ultimately improving the potential of rnai technology to identify optimal antiviral-drug candidates.",PMC3316894,PMC3316894_4
