"Elevated levels of circulating catecholamines, commonly seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, can lead to hypertension and cardiovascular complications. This association is also observed in CKD patients with renal failure.",PMC3463591,PMC3463591_0
"Renalase, a highly conserved protein expressed in kidneys, can degrade circulating catecholamines. Decreased renalase production is associated with hypertension and increased levels of circulating catecholamines in CKD patients.",PMC3463591,PMC3463591_1
"Both in vitro and animal studies have shown that renalase is expressed in extra-renal sources, such as skeletal muscles, small intestine, and vasculature. The regulation of renalase's expression is yet to be determined.",PMC3463591,PMC3463591_2
"In CKD patients on renal replacement therapy, renalase levels significantly decrease in both the kidneys and heart.",PMC3463591,PMC3463591_3
"Studies have shown that renalase gene polymorphisms are associated with primary hypertension, hypertension in type 2 diabetes, and ventricular hypertrophy in CKD patients. The extra-renal sources of renalase are also being investigated.",PMC3463591,PMC3463591_4
