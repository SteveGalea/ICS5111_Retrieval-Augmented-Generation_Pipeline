"The study demonstrates that a broad panel of human cell lines is susceptible to hcov-emc entry mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein emc-s, including cells derived from the colon, liver, kidney, and lung.",PMC3648152,PMC3648152_0
"The study reveals that hcov-emc uses a novel receptor for cellular entry, and it defines host cell enzymes important for activation of emc-s, which might constitute targets for intervention.",PMC3648152,PMC3648152_1
"The study shows that hcov-emc, like sars-cov, can be activated by endosomal cathepsins and type II transmembrane serine proteases in cell culture, suggesting that the activities of both proteases must be blocked in patients in order to efficiently suppress viral replication.",PMC3648152,PMC3648152_2
"The study identifies pseudotypes as a valuable tool for the detection of neutralizing antibodies directed against emc-s, a finding that has important implications for diagnostic approaches and efforts to characterize the humoral immune response in hcov-emc-infected patients.",PMC3648152,PMC3648152_3
"The study shows that serum from an hcov-emc-infected patient contains neutralizing antibodies specific for emc-s but not for vsv-g or sars-s, indicating that this tool might prove useful in determining the frequency of hcov-emc infection in patients and the potential cross-reactivity of serum with other coronavirus s proteins.",PMC3648152,PMC3648152_4
