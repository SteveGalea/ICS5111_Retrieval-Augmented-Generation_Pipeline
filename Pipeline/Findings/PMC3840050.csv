The structural analysis of sars-cov receptor interactions has revealed that critical residue changes in sars-cov and host receptor proteins present major species barriers for viral infections and determine host range and cross-species transmission.,PMC3840050,PMC3840050_0
Sars-cov adapted to civet and human ace2 proteins by strengthening the binding affinity to their receptors through mutations in the receptor-binding domain (rbd) of its spike protein.,PMC3840050,PMC3840050_1
"Mice support sars-cov infection at low levels because of the k353h residue change in their ace2, but rats are resistant to sars-cov infection because of the k353h and m82n double residue changes.",PMC3840050,PMC3840050_2
"Through natural evolutions of its rbd at key positions, sars-cov overcame the species barriers between some animal species, but not others.",PMC3840050,PMC3840050_3
"A structure-based prediction of future sars-cov evolution suggests that if sars-cov were given the opportunity to keep infecting humans and evolving in human cells, it could evolve into a human-optimized form with substantial affinity for human ace2.",PMC3840050,PMC3840050_4
