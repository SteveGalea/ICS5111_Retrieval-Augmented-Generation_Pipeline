"Spatio-temporal analysis of eight infectious diseases in China from 2006 to 2016 revealed a distinct increasing trend for hand-foot-mouth disease (hfmd) and hepatitis E, while decreasing trends for tap, dysentery, and hepatitis A were observed.",PMC6721277,PMC6721277_0
"The incidence of oiid remained steady, and summer was the season with the greatest number of cases of different infectious diseases.",PMC6721277,PMC6721277_1
"The spatio-temporal distribution of infectious diseases was unevenly distributed throughout China, with high-risk areas for hfmd and oiid located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region and south China. High-risk areas for tap were found in some parts of southwest China, while higher incidence rates for dysentery and hepatitis A were observed in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region and some western provincial units. High-risk areas for hepatitis E were found in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region and the Yangtze River delta area.",PMC6721277,PMC6721277_2
"The study suggests that the authorities should pay more attention to class C diseases and hepatitis E, as the incidence rate of hepatitis E surpassed hepatitis A.",PMC6721277,PMC6721277_3
"Disease-specific, location-specific, and disease-combined interventions should be established, regardless of the various distribution patterns of infectious diseases.",PMC6721277,PMC6721277_4
