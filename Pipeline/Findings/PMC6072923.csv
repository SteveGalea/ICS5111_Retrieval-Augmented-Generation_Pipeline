"In a study published in the Journal of Medical Virology, researchers found that the virus MERS-CoV, which is responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), could infect human dendritic cells, leading to dysregulation of the immune system. This finding could potentially contribute to the understanding of immunopathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection.",PMC6072923,PMC6072923_0
"In a review article published in the Journal of Clinical Virology, it was highlighted that the mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection is approximately 35%, which is higher than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV. This finding could help in the prioritization of research efforts towards MERS-CoV.",PMC6072923,PMC6072923_1
"A study published in the Journal of Medical Virology reported that MERS-CoV could efficiently infect t cells, which could potentially disrupt the adaptive immune responses. This finding could contribute to the understanding of immunopathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection.",PMC6072923,PMC6072923_2
"In a study published in the Journal of Medical Virology, researchers found that MERS-CoV could infect human dendritic cells, leading to dysregulation of the immune system. This finding could potentially help in the development of vaccines against MERS-CoV.",PMC6072923,PMC6072923_3
"A review article published in the Journal of Clinical Virology highlighted that MERS-CoV infection could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, which could contribute to the understanding of the clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV infection. This finding could potentially aid in the diagnosis and management of MERS-CoV infection.",PMC6072923,PMC6072923_4
