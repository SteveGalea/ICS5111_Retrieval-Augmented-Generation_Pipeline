"The study found that alkaline proteases from lactobacillus, such as lactococcus lactis, are being increasingly utilized in various industries due to their potential, and their future use is likely to be increased with advance strategies like protein/genetic engineering, molecular biology, and computational biology being adopted by researchers to generate improved protease-producing strains with desirable characteristics, such as yield improvement, changing substrate specificity, enhancement of thermal stability, altering optimum pH, and prevention of auto-proteolytic inactivation.",PMC6584820,PMC6584820_0
"The study revealed that genetic studies focused more on the p-i-type protease, which degrades predominantly beta casein in lactococcus lactis, a species of lactobacillus used as a starter culture in the dairy industry, due to differences in caseinolytic specificity in its proteolytic activity.",PMC6584820,PMC6584820_1
"The study showed that the gene encoding alkaline serine protease a (spra) and b (sprb) in streptomyces griseus, an organism used for commercial production of pronase, is initially secreted as a precursor with a size of 41 kda and is processed to its mature extracellular form (20 kda) after fusion of the promoter and signal sequences of E. Coli phoa to the proenzyme portion of the alpha-lytic protease gene.",PMC6584820,PMC6584820_2
"The study found that protease b, one of the major proteases secreted by streptomyces griseus atcc10137, is synthesized as a preproprotein with a size of 41 kda and is processed to its mature extracellular form (20 kda) in S. Lividans after gene amplification.",PMC6584820,PMC6584820_3
"The study demonstrated that the extracellular serine protease alpha-lytic protease representing the family of trypsin in a soil bacterium, Lysobacter enzymogenes 495, is synthesized as a preproprotein with a size of 41 kda and is processed to its mature extracellular form (20 kda) in S. Lividans after gene amplification.",PMC6584820,PMC6584820_4
