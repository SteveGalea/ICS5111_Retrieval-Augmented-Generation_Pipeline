Rapid identification of respiratory pathogens using real-time metagenomics: Two cases demonstrate the potential of this technique to accelerate diagnosis and improve antimicrobial stewardship by identifying pathogens faster than conventional culture-based techniques.,PMC5754443,PMC5754443_0
"Real-time metagenomics can identify bacteria, viruses, and fungi alike, making it a powerful tool for detecting known pathogens and identifying emerging diseases.",PMC5754443,PMC5754443_1
"Real-time metagenomic sequencing allows for rapid (48 hours) whole-genome sequencing of cultured isolates, improving antimicrobial therapy by identifying known resistance genes.",PMC5754443,PMC5754443_2
"While the sequencing approach demonstrates high specificity, further study is needed to determine its sensitivity for pathogen detection and to optimize the detection of microbial signal in host-DNA-rich respiratory specimens.",PMC5754443,PMC5754443_3
"Additional work is needed to streamline bioinformatic analysis of metagenomic sequencing data before this approach can be scaled for testing in a clinical context, and it remains unclear whether the method can detect fungal, viral, or protozoal pathogens in the lungs.",PMC5754443,PMC5754443_4
