The study identified 248 genes that were upregulated or downregulated in response to tlr7 stimulation in microglia and astrocytes.,PMC4516330,PMC4516330_0
"Microglia showed a broader response to tlr7 stimulation than astrocytes, with 165 genes exclusively upregulated in microglia.",PMC4516330,PMC4516330_1
"Ifi202b, a transcriptional regulator involved in interferon stimulated gene expression, was found to be specifically upregulated in microglia and was induced in the brain following virus infection.",PMC4516330,PMC4516330_2
"Sa3, a protein involved in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome, was upregulated at higher levels in microglia following tlr7 stimulation compared to tlr9 stimulation, potentially resulting in higher levels of active IL-1Î² and contributing to inflammatory responses in the brain.",PMC4516330,PMC4516330_3
"Other upregulated genes, including Gpr84, Birc3, Aw112010, and Bc023105, were consistently upregulated in activated microglia and astrocytes and may be useful markers of glial activation following infection or damage in the CNS.",PMC4516330,PMC4516330_4
