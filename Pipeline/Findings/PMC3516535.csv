"In a study examining the effects of θ-defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides derived from human neutrophils, on inflammatory responses, researchers found that rtd-1, a 12-residue θ-defensin, suppressed inflammatory cytokine release by human blood components, including whole blood, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and monocyte-macrophages, in response to bacterial and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.",PMC3516535,PMC3516535_0
"The researchers found that rtd-1 was also effective in suppressing cytokine/chemokine release by leukocytes in response to bacterial challenge in mouse models of systemic inflammation, including e. Coli peritonitis and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis.",PMC3516535,PMC3516535_1
"In the e. Coli peritonitis model, simultaneous but modest reductions in inflammatory cytokines were observed in rtd-1-treated animals, and a single dose of rtd-1 rescued mice rendered septic by CLP surgery, even when treatment was delayed for 24 hours after sepsis was induced.",PMC3516535,PMC3516535_2
"The researchers noted that the anti-inflammatory effects of rtd-1 varied significantly among the five θ-defensin isoforms, and the hierarchy of anti-tnf potencies was the same in bacterial and LPS-stimulated cellular assays.",PMC3516535,PMC3516535_3
"The biocompatibility of rtd-1 enabled an evaluation of its therapeutic potential in animal models of systemic inflammation, and its discovery raised the possibility that θ-defensins may have utility as human therapeutics due to the lack of immunogenicity and toxicity across species.",PMC3516535,PMC3516535_4
