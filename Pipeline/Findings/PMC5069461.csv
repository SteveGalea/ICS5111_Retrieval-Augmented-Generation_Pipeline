"This microarray analysis profiled global lncrnas and mRNAs in both active and latent hIV infection, revealing a quantitative pattern of modulations between the two infection stages. The study found that many of the differentially expressed lncrnas and mRNAs were specifically modulated during active or latent infection, suggesting a high degree of lncrna involvement in epigenetic modifications and subsequent transcriptional control.",PMC5069461,PMC5069461_0
"The study also found that many of the modulated lncrnas and mRNAs were distributed on both ""+"" and ""-"" strands of different chromosomes and belonged to all groups: intergenic, intron sense-overlapping, exon-sense overlapping, natural antisense, intronic antisense, and bidirectional. This knowledge can help determine lncrnas associated host factors responsible for guiding epigenetic remodeling and subsequent transcriptional control.",PMC5069461,PMC5069461_1
"The study found that many of the differentially expressed lncrnas and mRNAs were involved in 155 biological cycles, with the majority belonging to immunological and inflammatory significance. This was expected because most infection, including that by hIV, induces immunological and inflammatory defense signaling.",PMC5069461,PMC5069461_2
"The study also found that enrichment of replication-associated pathways (such as RNA transport pathway, nucleotide excision pathway, spliceosome pathway, and pyrimidine metabolism, etc.) during latent infection suggests a highly sophisticated and regressive epigenetics overhauling in comparison to active infection.",PMC5069461,PMC5069461_3
"The study suggests that disrupted expression of even a single coding or non-coding gene possesses the ability to affect multiple molecular pathways, and different pathological phenotypes may entangle in converged molecular circuits. Thus, the discovery of multiple epigenetic signatures can accelerate studies on their pathophysiologic mechanisms and lead to disease-modifying therapy.",PMC5069461,PMC5069461_4
