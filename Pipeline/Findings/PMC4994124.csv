The prevalence of pneumothorax in the study's pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) over a 5-year period was 10.4%.,PMC4994124,PMC4994124_0
Patients with pneumothorax had significantly longer lengths of stay (LOS) and higher mortality rates compared to patients without pneumothorax.,PMC4994124,PMC4994124_1
"Iatrogenic pneumothorax (IP) was the most common cause of pneumothorax, accounting for 95% of episodes. Barotrauma secondary to mechanical ventilation (MV) was the most common cause of IP, followed by central venous catheter (CVC) insertion and other causes.",PMC4994124,PMC4994124_2
"Patients with respiratory diseases on admission had significantly younger ages, lower body weights, lower Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores on day 1, higher need for MV, and higher incidences of pneumothorax episodes compared to patients without respiratory diseases on admission.",PMC4994124,PMC4994124_3
"The following variables were found to be significant risk factors for the occurrence of pneumothorax: peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and serum bicarbonate level (HCO3) on admission.",PMC4994124,PMC4994124_4
