"The study found that despite receiving prophylactic treatment with palivizumab, children with congenital heart disease (CHD) still have a significant risk of hospitalization due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, with a hospitalization rate of 12.2% and a mortality rate of 1.1%.",PMC5054186,PMC5054186_0
"The study revealed that children with CHD and RSV infection have a higher rate of morbidity, with 24% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 12% requiring mechanical ventilation, and 3 deaths related to RSV infection.",PMC5054186,PMC5054186_1
"The study found that children with CHD and RSV infection have a higher rate of re-hospitalization, with 3 patients hospitalized for RSV infection after the recommended age of 12 months, and 5 deaths related to RSV infection, with 3 among the 5 deaths associated with simple left-right shunt lesion.",PMC5054186,PMC5054186_2
"The study highlighted the importance of adhering to the existing guideline and identifying children with CHD, as missing or delayed injections may lead to increased rates of re-hospitalization.",PMC5054186,PMC5054186_3
"The study suggested that the national guideline for the use of palivizumab in infants with CHD might be regarded as outdated by international guidelines, as small doses and omitting or delaying palivizumab prophylaxis were found in major pediatric centers during the 2009-2015 RSV seasons, and the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection remains significant among children with CHD, cardiomyopathy, and children above 1 year-old with high-risk CHD.",PMC5054186,PMC5054186_4
