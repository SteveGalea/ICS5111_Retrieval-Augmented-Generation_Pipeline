The crystal structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of human betacoronavirus (HCoV) HKU1 has been determined.,PMC5529671,PMC5529671_0
"The RBD of HKU1 is a compact and stable homodimer, with each monomer consisting of a core domain and two flexible loops.",PMC5529671,PMC5529671_1
"The core domain of the RBD is composed of a conserved beta-sheet sandwich, which is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces.",PMC5529671,PMC5529671_2
"The flexible loops of the RBD are involved in binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for HKU1, and are critical for viral entry.",PMC5529671,PMC5529671_3
The crystal structure of the RBD provides insights into the structural basis for viral entry and may aid in the development of therapeutics targeting HKU1.,PMC5529671,PMC5529671_4
