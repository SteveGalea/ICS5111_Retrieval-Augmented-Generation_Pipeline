"In a study on osteoporosis, a significant decrease in bone density was observed in a rat model three months after ovariectomy.",PMC5995033,PMC5995033_0
"Network entropy, a topological metric of protein-protein interaction networks, was found to distinguish the inflammatory network from the normal network in cancer systems.",PMC5995033,PMC5995033_1
A significant difference in global network entropy was detected between low and high peak bone mass networks in the present study.,PMC5995033,PMC5995033_2
"Eight genes, including psma2, psmb1, psmc1, psmc4, psmd5, psmd7, psmd8, and psmd11, were identified in both monocyte low and high peak bone mass networks and were found to be related to calcium transport and macropain.",PMC5995033,PMC5995033_3
"The expression of these target genes in osteoporosis was significantly increased compared to sham controls in the present study, suggesting a role in controlling inflammation during bone monocyte progression.",PMC5995033,PMC5995033_4
