"The study found that during the a(h7n9) outbreak, the number of reported pue cases decreased in areas with lpm closure, but the proportion of pue cases testing positive for a(h7n9) also decreased in the weeks after closure, suggesting that lpm closure did not significantly control the outbreak.",PMC3837642,PMC3837642_0
"The study revealed that during the a(h7n9) outbreak, the proportion of pue cases positive for a(h7n9) was higher in elderly persons, particularly those over 60 years of age, and that men were more likely to test positive for a(h7n9) than women.",PMC3837642,PMC3837642_1
"The study demonstrated that during the a(h7n9) outbreak, the number of reported pue cases decreased in areas with lpm closure, but the reason for the decline was unclear, as the study found that the decreasing incidence of a(h7n9) could have been the case had there been a short wave of infected poultry passing through lpm closures, or that a(h7n9) may be seasonal in birds and therefore in humans, with lower transmission during the spring and summer months.",PMC3837642,PMC3837642_2
"The study highlighted that during the a(h7n9) outbreak, the proportion of pue cases testing positive for a(h7n9) also decreased in the weeks after lpm closure, but the reason for the decline was unclear, as the study found that how much increased local testing for a(h7n9) may have affected pue reporting is unknown.",PMC3837642,PMC3837642_3
"The study indicated that during the a(h7n9) outbreak, the proportion of pue cases testing positive for a(h7n9) decreased in areas with lpm closure, but the continued threat of additional viral adaptation to human hosts leading to increased transmissibility lends added urgency to the ongoing improvement of the pue system to better understand the epidemiology of a(h7n9), detect outbreaks, and evaluate control measures.",PMC3837642,PMC3837642_4
