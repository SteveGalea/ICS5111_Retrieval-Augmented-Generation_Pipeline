"Administration of the adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-derived interferon-α (IFN-α) construct in swine resulted in delayed viremia, decreased viral loads, and altered cytokine profiles in the presence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV).",PMC3318278,PMC3318278_0
"Seroconversion to PRRSV occurred later in swine given Ad5-IFN-α compared to those given Ad5-null, but there was no significant difference in neutralizing antibody titers between the two groups.",PMC3318278,PMC3318278_1
"PRRSV-specific interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-secreting cells were detected earlier in swine given Ad5-IFN-α compared to those given Ad5-null, but PRRSV-specific IFN-γ-secreting cells were present in both groups by day 28 postinfection.",PMC3318278,PMC3318278_2
"Administration of Ad5-IFN-α at the time of challenge resulted in a trend toward lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), in the lung lavage fluid on day 14 postinfection.",PMC3318278,PMC3318278_3
"The presence of IFN-α at PRRSV challenge altered the cytokine profile observed in the lung lavage fluid at day 14 postinfection, with a trend toward lower levels of IL-10 and IFN-γ, as well as the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α.",PMC3318278,PMC3318278_4
