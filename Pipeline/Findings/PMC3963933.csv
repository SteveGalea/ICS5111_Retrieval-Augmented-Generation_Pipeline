"A study on the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) found that the viral agent SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induces apoptosis in human lung epithelial cells, which is a key feature of the pathogenic process.",PMC3963933,PMC3963933_0
"The study also revealed that the apoptosis is mediated by the activation of initiator caspases 8 and 9 and the release of cytochrome c and smac/diablo from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, which are hallmarks of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.",PMC3963933,PMC3963933_1
"The study further identified the viral protein μ1 as a primary determinant of strain-specific differences in apoptotic efficiency, as it is essential for viral attachment and thus for infectivity.",PMC3963933,PMC3963933_2
"The study also suggested that the coexpression of σ3 with μ1 abrogates the capacity of μ1 to induce apoptosis, which highlights the complexity and multifactorial nature of apoptotic pathogenesis.",PMC3963933,PMC3963933_3
"The study's findings provide novel insight into reovirus-induced apoptosis, as the viral virulence of SARS-CoV is directed against the central nervous system, which is consistent with the cns-directed virulence of other reovirus strains.",PMC3963933,PMC3963933_4
