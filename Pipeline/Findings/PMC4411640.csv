"The current study in coastal Kenya reports a mean duration of rsv shedding of 13.5 days in symptomatic cases, which is higher than previous estimates in other settings. This observation raises questions about the relationship between virus infectiousness and shedding duration and warrants further work relating virus load to shedding duration.",PMC4411640,PMC4411640_0
"The study reveals instances where negative samples arose within rsv infection episodes, even though participants were sampled every 3-4 days regardless of symptoms. This observation suggests that alternative estimation of shedding patterns by calculating the area under the viral load curve might have some additional advantages and should be explored in future.",PMC4411640,PMC4411640_1
"The study finds that prolonged rsv shedding enhances the possibility of person-to-person transmission and makes young children a potential source of community spread of infection, with important implications in the control and prevention of rsv infection.",PMC4411640,PMC4411640_2
"The study observes an interaction between detection of other viruses, such as coronavirus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus in the nasopharynx and rate of recovery from rsv infection. This interaction might be a marker of low immunity associated with poor viral clearance.",PMC4411640,PMC4411640_3
"The study finds that individuals with lower respiratory tract infection shed for longer than those with upper respiratory tract infection, but evidence is controversial on the link between disease severity and viral load.",PMC4411640,PMC4411640_4
"The study reports a prolonged rsv shedding of over 3 weeks' duration in 24 (13.4%) individuals, most (70.8%) of whom had symptomatic episodes. These findings suggest that rsv shedding might be repeat infection or persistence and have potential importance on our existing view of acute rsv infection, the development of immunity, and effects on viral transmission.",PMC4411640,PMC4411640_5
The study observes that individuals aged less than 2 years shed rsv for longer than those aged 2-16 years (1.98 vs. 1.82 times faster). This finding suggests that age might act as a proxy of exposure to rsv in earlier epidemics and highlights the need for further work to explore the relationship between age and rsv shedding duration.,PMC4411640,PMC4411640_6
"The study finds that rsv episodes with concurrent spread in the household were associated with increased recovery rate. However, any conclusions",PMC4411640,PMC4411640_7
