"In a study on lung transplantation, researchers found that lung function, as measured by lung volumes and airway and parenchymal fibrosis, significantly improved in mice with ptx3 gene deletion. The study also revealed a decrease in lymphoid aggregates and myofibroblasts in the lungs of the mice.",PMC5823599,PMC5823599_0
"The study showed that the number of neutrophils and macrophages, as well as myofibroblast activity, was significantly lower in mice with ptx3 gene deletion compared to wild-type mice.",PMC5823599,PMC5823599_1
The researchers also found that soluble cytokines and chemokines in the lungs and plasma of the mice with ptx3 gene deletion were significantly lower compared to wild-type mice.,PMC5823599,PMC5823599_2
"The study utilized lung transplantation in mice with ptx3 gene deletion and measured lung volumes, airway and parenchymal fibrosis, as well as soluble cytokines and chemokines in the lungs and plasma of the mice at different time points.",PMC5823599,PMC5823599_3
"The study also used immunofluorescence staining to quantify lymphoid aggregates, myofibroblasts, and macrophages in the lungs of the mice with and without ptx3 gene deletion.",PMC5823599,PMC5823599_4
