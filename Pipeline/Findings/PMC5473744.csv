"The authors have developed a database, called the Integrated Sequence Variant Database (ISVDB), that stores imputed probabilistic variant state for CC strains and founder strains. This resource is a useful complement to sequencing data and allows the rapid generation of probabilistic variant states for F1 populations.",PMC5473744,PMC5473744_0
"The ISVDB includes predicted functional consequences of variant alleles, as well as allele calls themselves. This resource is easily accessible at http://isvdb.unc.edu.",PMC5473744,PMC5473744_1
"The authors note that, in the generations since the MRCAs, additional mutations have accumulated and rapidly become fixed due to the extremely small effective population size within each CC strain.",PMC5473744,PMC5473744_2
"The authors plan to incorporate three other males per strain from the sequencing generation, to better integrate sequence and same-generation MGP genotyping data, as well as to estimate genotype uncertainty and residual heterozygosity.",PMC5473744,PMC5473744_3
"The authors also plan to update the ISVDB with more accurate state and incorporate the newest high-resolution data to allow a useful comparison between generations, as well as to detect loci that have become fixed since the MRCAs and to investigate possible selective advantages of the newly fixed alleles.",PMC5473744,PMC5473744_4
