"Andes virus (andv) is capable of infecting primary, differentiated airway epithelial cells in a bidirectional but not an equivalent manner, indicating that different bunyaviruses utilize bidirectional secretion to different extents.",PMC1346943,PMC1346943_0
"Hantavirus infection is not limited to endothelial cells but can also infect the respiratory epithelium, allowing the virus to have direct access to the respiratory endothelium and disseminate to other organs, initiating hantavirus disease.",PMC1346943,PMC1346943_1
"β3 integrin, which serves as a receptor for pathogenic hantaviruses, is expressed in the hamster tec cultures and is most likely present in both the clara and goblet cell populations; however, the role of this molecule in airway epithelial tight junction integrity is not required for the integrity of the airway epithelium.",PMC1346943,PMC1346943_2
"Andes virus (andv) infection of primary, differentiated airway epithelial cells shows significantly less viral rna secretion, 102-fold to 103-fold less, than replication in the hamster tecs, suggesting a lack of bidirectional secretion in these cells.",PMC1346943,PMC1346943_3
"Hantavirus infection of laboratory mice shows significantly less viral rna secretion, 102-fold to 103-fold less, than replication in the hamster tecs, suggesting that murine β3 integrin is not capable of mediating hantavirus entry, and current data suggest that hantaviruses can replicate in the mouse, and virus-mediated disregulation of β3 integrin in endothelial cells may contribute to the pathogenesis seen in hps.",PMC1346943,PMC1346943_4
