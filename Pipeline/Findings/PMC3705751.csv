"This study identified four flavonoids, including baicalein, baicalin, apigenin, and chrysin, with anti-influenza a virus activities in Scutellaria baicalensis.",PMC3705751,PMC3705751_0
"Baicalein, a key antiviral component in etoac and chloroform extracts, exhibited potent anti-influenza a virus activity via inhibiting na enzymatic activity and reducing virus yield in cell cultures.",PMC3705751,PMC3705751_1
"Baicalein showed a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against influenza a variants, dengue, sendai, human cytomegalovirus, and hiv-1.",PMC3705751,PMC3705751_2
Combining low-dose baicalein with other antiviral agents could be alternative remedies against influenza a virus infection due to baicalein's high cytotoxicity to mdck cells.,PMC3705751,PMC3705751_3
"The study revealed that the hydrophobic interaction of potential inhibitors with the highly conserved pocket ii (ile222, arg224, and ser246) of na1 provides an alternative approach to treat na inhibitor-resistant mutants such as his274tyr, glu119val, and arg292lys mutation in na1, na2, and na9.",PMC3705751,PMC3705751_4
