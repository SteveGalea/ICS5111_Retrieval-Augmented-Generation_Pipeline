"The Tuberculosis Urban Prevention Study (TUPS) found that upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UV-GI) systems, when properly designed, installed, and maintained, can significantly reduce airborne transmission of tuberculosis (TB) in congregate settings.",PMC2099326,PMC2099326_0
"A randomized controlled trial of UV-GI systems in 12 New York City homeless shelters, called TUSS, found no statistically significant difference in symptoms between active UV-GI and placebo periods, indicating that the installation of UV-GI systems was achieved in a manner unlikely to compromise human safety.",PMC2099326,PMC2099326_1
"TUSS also revealed that accidental UV overexposure, the main cause of reported UV injury, was reported only once despite thousands of person-hours of use.",PMC2099326,PMC2099326_2
"Further UV-GI studies are needed to define improved design parameters for installations that are both safe and maximally effective, as the current UV-GI technologies, with proper engineering, installation, and maintenance, can be placed safely in a wide range of indoor spaces, even in buildings as diverse as homeless shelters.",PMC2099326,PMC2099326_3
"TUSS demonstrated that concerns regarding safety, particularly the possibility of photokeratoconjunctivitis and skin erythema from excessive UV-c exposure, should not deter application of carefully designed and maintained UV-GI systems.",PMC2099326,PMC2099326_4
