"A meta-analysis of nine studies involving a total of 1,232 participants found that individuals carrying the C allele of the rs12252 variant in the IFITM3 gene have a higher risk of contracting influenza, with a three-fold increase in susceptibility to severe influenza compared to mild influenza in the severe vs. Mild subgroup analysis.",PMC6518565,PMC6518565_0
"The study also found significant associations between the rs12252 variant and influenza in all four genetic models (allelic, dominant, recessive, and homozygote) in both Asian and Caucasian subgroup analyses, with the risk of influenza increasing 1.54-fold, 1.38-fold, 2.38-fold, and 2.80-fold, respectively.",PMC6518565,PMC6518565_1
"The study highlights the importance of gene C in the IFITM3 gene in susceptibility to influenza infection, as previous meta-analyses had not found any significant connection between the rs12252 variant and patients with mild infection.",PMC6518565,PMC6518565_2
"The study also identified a new association between the rs12252 variant and influenza in the severe vs. Mild subgroup analysis, as previous meta-analyses had not found any significant connection between the rs12252 variant and patients with mild infection.",PMC6518565,PMC6518565_3
"The study's results indicate that individuals carrying the C allele of the rs12252 variant in the IFITM3 gene are more susceptible to influenza infection, regardless of ethnicity, as the study found significant differences in all four genetic models in both Asian and Caucasian subgroup analyses.",PMC6518565,PMC6518565_4
"The study's findings suggest that the IFITM3 gene may play a critical role in the host's response to influenza infection, as the risk of influenza increases with the number of C alleles in the IFITM3 gene, and the study's results are consistent with the findings of previous studies that have reported a reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infection in individuals carrying the C allele of the rs12252 variant in the IFITM3 gene.",PMC6518565,PMC6518565_5
"The study's results also suggest that the IFITM3 gene may have different effects on influenza susceptibility in different ethnic groups,",PMC6518565,PMC6518565_6
