"A wide range of coronaviruses (covs) are circulating among bats in Saudi Arabia, with a prevalence of approximately 28% in fecal samples.",PMC3837665,PMC3837665_0
"While the prevalence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) covs was low (1 bat infected with a MERS cov), it is consistent with the prevalence of covs among bats in Mexico and lower than the infection rate for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like covs in rhinolophid bats in China.",PMC3837665,PMC3837665_1
"The sensitivity for viral nucleic acid detection in samples collected in October 2012 may have been reduced due to failure in cold chain transport. In April 2013, 219 (32%) of 675 fecal pellets collected were positive for covs by PCR, while only 8 (5%) of 148 rectal swab samples or fecal pellets collected in October 2012 were positive by the same assays.",PMC3837665,PMC3837665_2
"Bats are reservoirs of several viruses that can cause human diseases, including MERS-related covs, which have been found in many bat families. Cross-species transmission from bats to humans can be direct or facilitated by intermediate hosts. Bat covs are typically host specific, but MERS-related covs have been found in multiple bat families, including Emballonuridae (sheath-tailed bats) in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe.",PMC3837665,PMC3837665_3
