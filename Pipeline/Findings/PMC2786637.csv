"The study compared the performances of five commercial DNA extraction methods, including two automated methods (Magna Pure Compact and Biorobot ez1) and three manual methods (QIAmp DNA Mini Kit, High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit, and High Pure PREPAN Kit), for the detection of Toxoplasma gondii in feline af samples.",PMC2786637,PMC2786637_0
"The study found that two automated methods, Magna Pure Compact and Biorobot ez1, produced the best results for the detection of T. gondii, with a mean result of 60% positive reactions at the lowest concentration (1 T/ml).",PMC2786637,PMC2786637_1
"The study also evaluated the effectiveness of each method for extracting human DNA, and found that two automated methods, Nuclisens EZ1 and Biorobot ez1, exhibited the lowest yields in extracting human DNA, which could be related to the lysis step and/or the quantity of silica particles.",PMC2786637,PMC2786637_2
"The study detected inhibitors only in samples extracted using the two extraction procedures commercialized by Roche, particularly with the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit, and found that poor adaptation between extraction procedures and master mixes from different manufacturers could lead to different PCR results, potentially including inhibition of DNA polymerase.",PMC2786637,PMC2786637_3
"The study suggests that optimal extraction and amplification methods should be used, taking into account the physical properties of the microorganism targeted, especially when the lysis protocol does not include proteinase K pretreatment, and the high specificity of real-time PCR chemistries may render the optimization of the molecular tool more complex and more specific, particularly the combination of the ""right"" extraction plus the ""right"" amplification. Ideally, an evaluation of several combined extraction and PCR methods, each optimized in combination with the other, should be undertaken for each microorganism and sample type being examined.",PMC2786637,PMC2786637_4
