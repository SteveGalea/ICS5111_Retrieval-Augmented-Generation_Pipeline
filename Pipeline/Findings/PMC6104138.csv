"Cva6 infection induces significant cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase in human rhabdomyosarcoma rd cells, which promotes viral replication but not affecting virus entry.",PMC6104138,PMC6104138_0
"Cva6 infection downregulates CDK4, CDK6, and CYCLIN D1 expression, while upregulating the p53-p21 and p16 pathway, indicating that cva6 replication is associated with G0/G1-phase arrest.",PMC6104138,PMC6104138_1
"Cva6 infection downregulates cyclin E and CDK2 expression, indicating that it inhibits S-phase entry.",PMC6104138,PMC6104138_2
"Cva6 infection downregulates cyclin B1 and CDK1 expression, indicating that it promotes G2/M-phase exit.",PMC6104138,PMC6104138_3
"The expression of non-structural proteins 3C and 3D, which are important to viral production, is induced by cva6 infection, suggesting that 3C (a protease) and 3D (an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) are putative targets for the strategic development of new antiviral therapies.",PMC6104138,PMC6104138_4
