"The paper describes the successful construction and characterisation of a complete reverse genetics system for dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) using a low-passage clinical isolate, which overcomes the inherent instability of flavivirus genomes in E. Coli.",PMC4005542,PMC4005542_0
"The study demonstrates the utility of a yeast-based cloning host and a homologous recombination strategy, which allows for the stable propagation of DENV-3 genome in yeast.",PMC4005542,PMC4005542_1
"The paper reports the successful assembly of a full-length DENV-3 infectious clone in yeast, which remains infectious even after repeated passages of the plasmid in yeast.",PMC4005542,PMC4005542_2
"The study shows that DENV-3 replicon is functional and is capable of autonomous replication in transfected BHK-21 cells, and that the nucleotide sequence of DENV-3 viral genome remains unchanged after successive passages of the plasmid in yeast.",PMC4005542,PMC4005542_3
"The paper highlights the need to expand the methodology of reverse genetics systems for low-passage clinical isolates of flaviviruses to gain a complete picture in flavivirus biology, particularly in virus pathogenesis, virulence determinants, and vector competence.",PMC4005542,PMC4005542_4
