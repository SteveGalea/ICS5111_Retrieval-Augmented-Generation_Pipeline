"Prevalence of coronaviruses (COV) in bats in northern Germany is 9.8%, similar to studies in China and North America.",PMC2570906,PMC2570906_0
"Factors influencing COV detection include young age and ongoing lactation, but not gravidity, with female bats in maternity colonies having significantly higher detection rates than those in foraging or swarming sites.",PMC2570906,PMC2570906_1
"Four different lineages of COV associated with bat species in northern Germany have been identified, with lineage 1 associated with M. Dasycneme, lineage 2 with P. Nathusii, lineage 3 with P. Pygmaeus, and lineage 4 with M. Daubentonii.",PMC2570906,PMC2570906_2
"COV transmission between bat colonies suggests the possibility of host transition within geographically closely associated but genetically distinct bat species, with viruses in P. Nathusii and P. Pygmaeus potentially diversifying after host transition.",PMC2570906,PMC2570906_3
"COV prevalence in bats in northern Germany supports the hypothesis that host transition between mammals, including bat species, may occur both accidental and infrequent, as well as after host transition within geographically closely associated but genetically distinct bat species.",PMC2570906,PMC2570906_4
