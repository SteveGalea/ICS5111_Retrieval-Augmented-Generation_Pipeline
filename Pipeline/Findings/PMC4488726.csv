"Two bacterial proteins, mab and mav, were identified as functional homologues of the mammalian interferon-inducible protein (ifitm3) with antiviral activity against influenza virus.",PMC4488726,PMC4488726_0
"Mab and mav ifitms, like ifitm3, are palmitoylated in mammalian cells, and the level of palmitoylation correlates with their antiviral activity.",PMC4488726,PMC4488726_1
"Mab and mav ifitms, like ifitm3, are partially localized to cathepsin-b-positive cellular compartments, but the level of co-localization is lower than that of ifitm3.",PMC4488726,PMC4488726_2
"The co-localization of mycobacterial ifitms with cathepsin-b-positive compartments suggests that the strong co-localization seen between mycobacterial ifitms and ifitm3 in cells is indeed due to an interaction between these proteins, since mycobacterial ifitms and ifitm3 do not localize to precisely the same compartments when expressed in isolation.",PMC4488726,PMC4488726_3
Further study of the bacterial ifitms may provide greater understanding of ifitm3 post-translational regulation and antiviral activity.,PMC4488726,PMC4488726_4
