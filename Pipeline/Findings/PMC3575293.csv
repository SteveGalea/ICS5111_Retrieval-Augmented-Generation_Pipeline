The study identified s365-374 as an optimal h-2 kd ctl epitope in the sars cov s protein.,PMC3575293,PMC3575293_0
"Y367, S370, and L374 are anchors in the epitope, while C366, G368, V369, A371, T372, and K373 may directly interact with tcr on the surface of cd8-t cells.",PMC3575293,PMC3575293_1
"The study confirmed that L374 is the carboxyl-terminal anchor in the epitope, but K365, which was predicted to be included in this optimal epitope, was not found to be an important residue for the peptide-tcr interaction.",PMC3575293,PMC3575293_2
"The study showed that Y367, S370, and T372 are important residues in presenting to tcr in this optimal ctl epitope, while C366, G368, V369, A371, and K373 may make lesser contributions in presenting to tcr.",PMC3575293,PMC3575293_3
"The study demonstrated that S366-374 is an optimal h-2 kd ctl epitope in the sars cov s protein, and that Y367, S370, and L374 are anchors in the epitope, while C366, G368, V369, A371, T372, and K373 may directly interact with tcr on the surface of cd8-t cells. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the functional and structural roles of different residues within this optimal ctl epitope.",PMC3575293,PMC3575293_4
