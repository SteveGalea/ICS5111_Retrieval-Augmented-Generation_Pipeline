"The current study describes an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis caused by norovirus (nv) infection in a confined environment, with multiple infections of both nv and astrovirus (asv) detected in some individuals.",PMC1393082,PMC1393082_0
"The outbreak had a typical clinical course, with symptoms developing quickly and lasting only a few days. The epidemic curve generated from the data had a sharp single peak, suggesting a point source.",PMC1393082,PMC1393082_1
"Genotypic variations among the infecting nv strains were identified, with a single-point recombination event possibly occurring in one nv isolate.",PMC1393082,PMC1393082_2
"The study highlights the potential for asymptomatic individuals to be effective transmitters of nv and asv, as both symptomatic and asymptomatic food handlers have been implicated in many food-borne outbreaks of gastroenteritis.",PMC1393082,PMC1393082_3
"The study suggests that multiple nv variants may be detected from infected individuals in such outbreaks, with the occurrence and persistence of the outbreak in a strictly closed setting possibly promoting viral genetic diversity.",PMC1393082,PMC1393082_4
