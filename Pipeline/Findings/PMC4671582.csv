"This study highlights the importance of emerging highly pathogenic pathogens such as mers-cov, h5n1, and h7n9 in vaccine development due to their high pathogenicity and the lack of effective vaccines against them.",PMC4671582,PMC4671582_0
"The n protein of mers-cov, which is abundantly produced during infection and exhibits strong immunogenicity and conservancy, is identified as a potential immunogen to elicit both cellular and humoral immune responses against mers-cov.",PMC4671582,PMC4671582_1
"The study systematically screens b-cell epitopes, helper t-cell epitopes, and ctl epitopes in the n protein of mers-cov to obtain putative epitope vaccine candidates.",PMC4671582,PMC4671582_2
"The study emphasizes the need to consider various parameters, including hla specificity and population coverage, when screening epitopes due to the highly polymorphic nature of hla proteins in diverse ethnic populations.",PMC4671582,PMC4671582_3
"All putative epitope vaccine candidates identified in this study are highly conserved in designated mers-cov isolates, suggesting their potential as efficient vaccines against mers-cov.",PMC4671582,PMC4671582_4
