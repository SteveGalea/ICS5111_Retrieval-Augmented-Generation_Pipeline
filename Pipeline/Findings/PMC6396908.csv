"The study reports the development of a di-244 variant encoding a fluorescent protein, which allows monitoring of dip production in cell culture. This is important as previous dip preparations were produced in the presence of standard virus or in hen's eggs, requiring subsequent inactivation of the virus.",PMC6396908,PMC6396908_0
The study demonstrates that cells stably expressing pb2 allow the production and quantification of di-244 particles solely from plasmids and in the absence of standard virus. This is significant as it overcomes the technical challenges associated with controlling the efficiency of uv inactivation of standard virus and interpreting experimental data and animal trials.,PMC6396908,PMC6396908_1
"The study shows that the availability of a di-244 variant encoding a fluorescent protein allows the quantification of dip infectivity using a standard technique, focus formation assay. This is crucial as it provides a method to compare results obtained with different di-244 preparations or other segment 1 dips and to determine whether sufficient numbers of dips can be delivered to the human respiratory tract and remain stable to provide protection against influenza for a prolonged time.",PMC6396908,PMC6396908_2
"The study confirms that dip-mediated inhibition of ibv infection in cell culture is not observed due to absence of genome competition, but it suggests that dip-generated inhibition of spread of diverse iav subtypes in cell culture is comparable to that of di-244 generated by use of standard virus, demonstrating that dips produced in pb2 expressing cells are fully functional.",PMC6396908,PMC6396908_3
"The study shows that di-244 particles and other segment 1 dips have to be provided in vast excess to exert antiviral activity, as reassortment of dips with iav in coinfected cells is likely to occur. This finding matches data published for di-244 generated by use of standard virus and demonstrates that dips produced in pb2 expressing cells are fully functional, although the activity of purified dips remains to be examined.",PMC6396908,PMC6396908_4
