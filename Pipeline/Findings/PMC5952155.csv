"The vRP 3526 platform, which uses a vee virus replicon vector to express the sars-cov spike glycoprotein, can produce sufficient protein for the production of virus-like particles (VLPs) for vaccine development.",PMC5952155,PMC5952155_0
"VLPs generated from the vRP 3526 platform can be detected by a mouse anti-sars-cov VLP polyclonal serum, indicating the presence of antigenic epitopes on the VLP surface.",PMC5952155,PMC5952155_1
The norwalk virus orf2 gene can be inserted directly into the vRP 3526 platform to produce VLPs for vaccine development.,PMC5952155,PMC5952155_2
Mouse anti-sars-cov VLP polyclonal serum can be used to detect VLPs generated from the vRP 3526 platform at a concentration of 2 μg/ml.,PMC5952155,PMC5952155_3
"Pig gastric mucin type iii (sgm), solvated in pBS at 5 mg/ml, can be used as a carbohydrate ligand for VLP binding assays, and a mouse anti-sars-cov VLP monoclonal antibody can be used to detect VLPs generated from the vRP 3526 platform at a concentration of 2 μg/ml, followed by anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (hrp) and color development with one-step ultra tmb elisa hrp substrate solution (Thermo Fisher).",PMC5952155,PMC5952155_4
