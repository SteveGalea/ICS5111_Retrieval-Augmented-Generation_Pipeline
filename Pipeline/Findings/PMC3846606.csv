"The study compared the genome sequence of simian varicella virus (SVV) Delta31/61, which causes rhesus macaque (RM) disease, to that of wild-type (WT) SVV in RM and SVV-infected vero cells using microarray hybridization-based method. The identified mismatches were directly sequenced from PCR products obtained from amplifying the surrounding sequence.",PMC3846606,PMC3846606_0
"The study measured SVV Delta31/61 and WT SVV viral loads in whole blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, and portions of frozen ganglia using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) dna. Values below the limit of detection were designated as nd, or not detected.",PMC3846606,PMC3846606_1
The study measured the levels of simian interferon (IFN) alpha in plasma and BAL supernatant samples using cytokine monkey magnetic 28-plex panel as per the manufacturer's instructions. IFN alpha levels were measured using log-log transformation of the linear portion of the curve with 0.1 optical density (OD) units as the cut-off. Titers were standardized using a positive control sample included with each assay.,PMC3846606,PMC3846606_2
The study analyzed the frequency and proliferation of T cells and B cells in BAL cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using surface staining with antibodies against specific markers. Cells were fixed and permeabilized according to manufacturer recommendations before the addition of Ki67-specific antibody. The samples were analyzed using the LSRII instrument and FlowJo software.,PMC3846606,PMC3846606_3
"The study delineated the naive (CD28+CD95-), central memory (CD28+CD95+), and effector memory (CD28-CD95+) T cell subsets, as well as the naive (CD20+IGD+CD27-), marginal zone-like (CD20+IGD+CD27+), and memory (CD20+IGD-CD27+) B cell subsets using antibodies against specific markers. Cells were fixed and permeabilized according to manufacturer recommendations before the addition of brefeldin A (Sigma, St Louis, MO) to block c",PMC3846606,PMC3846606_4
