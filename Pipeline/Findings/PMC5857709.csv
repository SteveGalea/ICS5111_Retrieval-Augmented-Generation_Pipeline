"In a survey of 400 Singaporeans, most participants reported a high tolerance for interventions that curtail individual liberties, such as isolation and quarantine, both strategies that have been used in recent history in Singapore. This finding highlights the need for policy makers to consider the preferences and trade-offs between known interventions and known outcomes of those interventions, as decisions about how to respond to public health threats must continue to be based on scientific advice and political imperatives at an early stage of an outbreak of a novel pathogen, where policy makers face grave uncertainty about the outcomes of interventions because the characteristics of the pathogen’s transmission routes and potential, the severity and symptoms of the disease it causes, and the public reaction is unpredictable.",PMC5857709,PMC5857709_0
"The survey revealed that the preferences of the population level are not uniform, and participants could be broadly categorized into two groupings: one group (mortality averse) was strongly motivated to reduce the number of deaths and willing to accept interventions that did so, whereas another (expenditure averse, 37% of the respondents) was tax averse, and not in favor of any measures that might increase their taxes, even at levels comparable to the per capita costs of Singapore’s routine dengue vector control program.",PMC5857709,PMC5857709_1
"The survey found that two such examples emerged: (1) temperature screening island-wide received considerable support by the survey participants, although temperature screening at the country’s main airport was estimated only to pick up around one imported case in 2009, and (2) the predicted risk of infectious disease outbreaks was considerably underestimated: 2013 saw approximately 2,000 dengue infections in Singapore, but the mean forecast risk of an outbreak infecting at least 200 people was a mere 29%.",PMC5857709,PMC5857709_2
"The survey revealed that future studies might evaluate the effect of priming respondents with accurate public health information before eliciting their preferences, as information from such surveys could be used to explain the rationale for particular decisions, with hierarchical cluster analysis used to support the targeting of different messages to audiences with different values.",PMC5857709,PMC5857709_3
