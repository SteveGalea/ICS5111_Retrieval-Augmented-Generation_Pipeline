"The study demonstrated that prrsv nsp4 protein could induce cell apoptosis in various cell lines, including Marc-145 cells and many other cell types.",PMC3720278,PMC3720278_0
"The study found that apoptosis occurred both in nsp4-expressing cells and the surrounding cells, suggesting the possibility of local release of cytokines or high expression of surface tnf receptor superfamily.",PMC3720278,PMC3720278_1
"The study showed that all three domains of nsp4 were essential for it to induce apoptosis, and his39, asp64, and ser118 were critical for nsp4 to cause apoptosis.",PMC3720278,PMC3720278_2
"The study demonstrated that the ability of nsp4 to induce apoptosis was dependent on its 3c-like protease activity, and blocking caspase-8 activation by its inhibitor led to a nearly complete inhibition of prrsv-induced or nsp4-induced apoptosis.",PMC3720278,PMC3720278_3
"The study showed that prrsv nsp4-induced apoptosis represents the first report of 3c-like protease-mediated apoptosis in the genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae.",PMC3720278,PMC3720278_4
