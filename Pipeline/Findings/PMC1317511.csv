"The study identified 13 envelope mutations in aslv-a, a class i envelope-defective virus that encodes a single fusion protein, which displayed enhanced sensitivity to the hr2 peptide inhibitor r99. These mutations were distributed across two distinct regions within the envelope: the n-terminal region of the tm subunit, which is also found in filoviral glycoproteins, and a region between the su/tm cleavage site and the fusion peptide.",PMC1317511,PMC1317511_0
"The study found that for a subset of the mutants, the activation threshold for membrane fusion was lower, as reflected by their in vitro requirements for receptor-mediated triggering. This suggests a potential mechanism by which alternative receptors might trigger these mutants, without requiring a change in the binding affinity for the putative alternative receptors.",PMC1317511,PMC1317511_1
"Some enfuvirtide resistance mutations of HIV have also been noted to be more sensitive to neutralization, which may reflect a destabilized native conformation, in which access to neutralizing epitopes is enhanced, or a modification of the conformational changes in envelope, such that the epitopes are exposed for a longer period of time.",PMC1317511,PMC1317511_2
"The study found that for some of the HIV-1 coreceptor-independent mutants, determinants of coreceptor specificity within gp120 involved altered interactions between envelope and receptor(s), and these changes appear to be linked to enfuvirtide sensitivity.",PMC1317511,PMC1317511_3
"The experiments described in the study characterize envelope function with single-round infection assays, and it is possible that some or all of the mutations might not be well tolerated in the absence of r99 selection, as viral fitness is decreased for HIV-1 enfuvirtide-selected mutants. However, all of the aslv-a mutant envelopes reported in the study mediated infection of avian QT6 cells with wild-type efficiency, and production of replication-competent aslv-encoding the L62a envelope variant that displays peptide resistance and expanded tropism did not result in rapid reversion to wild-type sequence.",PMC1317511,PMC1317511_4
