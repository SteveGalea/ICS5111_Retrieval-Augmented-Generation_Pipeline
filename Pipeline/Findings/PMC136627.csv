"Four hsv-1 glycoproteins, gd, gb, and ghl, are required for both cell-cell fusion and virus entry.",PMC136627,PMC136627_0
"Replacement of the transmembrane domain of ghl with analogous regions of other transmembrane proteins abolishes fusion function, indicating that the gh transmembrane domain is essential for hsv-mediated membrane fusion.",PMC136627,PMC136627_1
"Single-residue deletions in the transmembrane sequence of ghl result in loss of function, suggesting that the gh transmembrane domain is close to its critical minimum length.",PMC136627,PMC136627_2
"Specific sequence requirements in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of ghl play important roles, either in interacting with other proteins or acting directly in the fusion process, and similar conclusions have been drawn from studies of gb.",PMC136627,PMC136627_3
"The gd heterodimer is essential for hsv-mediated membrane fusion, but its membrane anchor and cytoplasmic tail contain no specific sequence requirements, indicating that it must react with specific receptors.",PMC136627,PMC136627_4
"A transmembrane anchor is required for full fusion activity of influenza virus ha, but specific sequence requirements within the transmembrane domain have been identified for other viral fusion proteins, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1, murine leukemia virus, foamy viruses, coronavirus, vsv, newcastle disease virus, and measles virus, but these findings are not necessarily directly comparable to those of hsv-1 ghl.",PMC136627,PMC136627_5
