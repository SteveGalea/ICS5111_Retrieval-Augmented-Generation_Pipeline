"The study reported a rational approach for discovering novel aromatase inhibitors with a robust htrf-based aromatase assay, which demonstrated a reasonable s/b ratio and z′ factor.",PMC4125720,PMC4125720_0
"The study identified two chemical classes of compounds, flavone derivatives and diterpenoid alkaloid natural products, as aromatase inhibitors, with the most potent compound, xhn27, belonging to the former class.",PMC4125720,PMC4125720_1
"The study suggested that the isoflavone ring skeleton may not be suitable for the development of aromatase inhibitors due to its poor inhibition potency, as demonstrated during molecular docking.",PMC4125720,PMC4125720_2
"The study delineated the structure-activity relationship for the most potent compound, xhn27, during the molecular docking study.",PMC4125720,PMC4125720_3
"The study suggested that xhn27 may be a competitive aromatase inhibitor due to its interactions with aromatase, including a hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bond, and π-cation connection, as observed during docking.",PMC4125720,PMC4125720_4
