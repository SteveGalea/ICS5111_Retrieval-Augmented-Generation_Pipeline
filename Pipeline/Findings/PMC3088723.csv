Location and frequency of breakpoints detected along the genomes of 47 randomly selected recombinants. Figure S1 shows the location and frequency of breakpoints found in the 47 analyzed recombinants. Each adjacent discriminating position between tyx and tox (shown in Figure 1A) was used to delimit a region within which fragments originating from the different parental genomes were ligated during the l-dna-shuffling procedure. The y-axis represents the frequency with which a breakpoint was detected within one of these particular delimited regions.,PMC3088723,PMC3088723_0
"Correlation at 22 days post inoculation between the proportion of tyx genome and infectivity and virus accumulation in the 47 randomly selected recombinants. Figure S3 shows the correlation at 22 days post inoculation between the proportion of tyx genome and (a) infectivity and (b) virus accumulation in the 47 recombinants presented in Figure 1B. The circles represent the 47 recombinants and the two parental genomes; a smooth trend line is added in red. Linear regression lines are represented in black, with r2 = 0.102 (p = 0.025; t-test) for infectivity and r2 = 0.211 (p = 8.9 × 10−4; t-test) for virus accumulation.",PMC3088723,PMC3088723_1
"Creation of full-length infectious parental clones, tyx and tolxv, in the binary vector pcambia0380 according to [35]. Figure S4 shows the creation of full-length infectious parental clones, tyx and tolxv, in the binary vector pcambia0380 according to [35]. (a) Site-directed mutagenesis at the end of the stem-loop to generate an xhoi site in tylcv and tolxv. (b) Oligonucleotide sequence used to insert the common stem-loop shown in Figure 1B at the smi site of the multiple cloning site of pcambia0380. The solid horizontal lines represent the inverted repeats that constitute the stem of the stem-loop, and the dotted lines represent restriction sites. The",PMC3088723,PMC3088723_2
