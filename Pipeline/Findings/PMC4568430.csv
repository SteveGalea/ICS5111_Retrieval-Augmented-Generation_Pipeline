"The study found that having received vaccination against the seasonal flu virus in the past is the best predictor of future readiness to get vaccinated during another influenza pandemic. This is in line with prior research, as people who normally get flu shots are five times more likely to seek immunization soon after news of a novel influenza pandemic would spread than their counterparts who avoided the seasonal flu shots.",PMC4568430,PMC4568430_0
The study also found that fear of losing one's life in case of infection with h1n1 is a strong predictor of future vaccination readiness. People who feared for their lives in case of infection with h1n1 are four times more willing to seek vaccination in case of a novel pandemic than people who were not afraid.,PMC4568430,PMC4568430_1
"The study did not find a significant relationship between the assessment of institutional performance during the h1n1 pandemic and future vaccination readiness. This suggests that perception of the official handling of the pandemic is not actually considered by people when making decisions about their own health, as behavioral intention is not the same as behavior, and the former cannot that easily be taken as an indicator of the latter.",PMC4568430,PMC4568430_2
"The study found that having received vaccination against the h1n1 virus in the past did not receive significance due to small n (95% ci: 0.30 to 88.36). However, having received vaccination against the h1n1 virus was still significantly associated with future vaccination readiness. This highlights the fact that behavioral intention is less a willingness to act but rather a willingness to consider.",PMC4568430,PMC4568430_3
"The study found that willingness to get vaccinated next time was best predicted by similar behavior in the past, but willingness was also much more prevalent than actual past behavior. This highlights the fact that behavioral intention is not the same as behavior, and the former cannot that easily be taken as an indicator of the latter. Additionally, willingness was much more prevalent than actual past behavior, suggesting that behavioral intention is less a willingness to act but rather a willingness to consider.",PMC4568430,PMC4568430_4
