"The study identified several inhibitory peptides against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, including peptides 174-200, 233-263, 264-291, and 297-315. These peptides showed inhibitory effects at concentrations as low as 50 μM, and some of them were found to be effective at blocking HCMV infection at concentrations as low as 10 μM.",PMC3050824,PMC3050824_0
"The study revealed that the most potent inhibitors of HCMV infection, peptides 264-291 and 297-315, showed additive inhibitory effects when tested in combination, suggesting that peptides with unique amino acid sequences, biophysical properties, and concentrations could be developed as a novel therapeutic against HCMV.",PMC3050824,PMC3050824_1
"The study showed that the inhibitory peptides identified here had no statistically significant toxicity at the highest concentrations tested, suggesting that the proposed peptide-based agents would not require activation by virally encoded proteins, further phosphorylation by cellular enzymes, or incorporation into the growing viral dna by viral dna polymerase, as the current FDA-approved therapeutics to treat HCMV infection do.",PMC3050824,PMC3050824_2
"The study demonstrated that the effects of some of the HCMV inhibitory peptides did not follow a linear dose-dependent inhibition, suggesting that peptide-based therapies would be predicted not to provoke drug-induced resistance, a significant problem with existing FDA-approved therapeutics to treat HCMV infection.",PMC3050824,PMC3050824_3
"The study showed that some of the HCMV inhibitory peptides, including peptides 264-291 and 297-315, worked additively to block HCMV infection, which could potentiate the development of a novel therapeutic against HCMV, as the emergence of clinically relevant drug-resistant HCMV is a significant problem with existing FDA-approved therapeutics to treat HCMV infection.",PMC3050824,PMC3050824_4
