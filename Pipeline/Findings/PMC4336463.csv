Lower expression of claudin-1 in the foreskin of hsv-2 seropositive men compared to hsv-2 seronegative men was observed at the mRNA level.,PMC4336463,PMC4336463_0
"The irregular distribution of claudin-1 within the foreskin epithelial layer was observed in immunofluorescent staining, with areas of thick surface interspersed with thin, positively stained cell layers, and differences in staining intensity.",PMC4336463,PMC4336463_1
"The association between hsv-2 seropositivity and lower claudin-1 mRNA expression warrants further studies, as a less robust genital epithelial barrier in hsv-2 seropositive men could facilitate entrance of STIs, including HIV.",PMC4336463,PMC4336463_2
"The study participants were sexually active and living in an HIV-endemic geographical area, and the study demonstrated that their HIV-2 serostatus was not associated with general mucosal inflammation at the foreskin tissue level.",PMC4336463,PMC4336463_3
"Altered expression levels of claudin-1 may also affect susceptibility to other genital infections, as previously described, but this could not be assessed in the present study since men with symptomatic or laboratory-confirmed genital infections were not eligible for circumcision.",PMC4336463,PMC4336463_4
