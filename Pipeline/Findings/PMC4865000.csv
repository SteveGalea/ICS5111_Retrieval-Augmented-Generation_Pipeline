"A study on respiratory viruses in children with upper respiratory tract infections (URI) found that human bocavirus 1 (hBV-1) was detected in 24% of URI episodes, with hBV-1 alone being associated with a high rate of acute otitis media (AOM) complications.",PMC4865000,PMC4865000_0
"The study also revealed that hBV-1 was frequently detected in combination with other respiratory viruses, with 45% of children with hBV-1 in URI having the virus detected more than once.",PMC4865000,PMC4865000_1
"The incidence of hBV-1 detection in the study was among the highest published, with prolonged shedding of hBV-1 in nasal secretions observed up to 11 weeks in children attending day care and up to 3 months in otitis-prone children.",PMC4865000,PMC4865000_2
"The study found that viral load in cases of hBV-1 alone was relatively high, with a mean viral load of 1.8 x 1010 copies/ml of the original sample.",PMC4865000,PMC4865000_3
"The study suggested that hBV-1 may play an important role in AOM pathogenesis, similar to other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenoviruses, and coronaviruses.",PMC4865000,PMC4865000_4
