"This study, which compared data from a temperate and a subtropical climate, found a consistent association between seasonal influenza circulation and acute myocardial infarction (mi)-associated hospitalizations and deaths in two different settings characterized by differing populations, climates, and patterns of health-seeking behavior.",PMC3100509,PMC3100509_0
"The study estimated that up to 5.6% of mi-associated deaths in Hong Kong and 3.4% in England and Wales were attributed to influenza, with the effect of influenza on mi occurring mainly in elderly persons who are relatively highly vaccinated.",PMC3100509,PMC3100509_1
"The study found that acute cardiac events should be considered when anticipating influenza outbreaks, and that differences in consulting behavior may explain the reduced reporting delay in Hong Kong influenza data.",PMC3100509,PMC3100509_2
"The study showed that associations between influenza and mi-associated deaths and hospitalizations were most marked in the oldest-aged persons, who are more likely to have extensive underlying coronary disease.",PMC3100509,PMC3100509_3
"The study found that after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, official advice in Hong Kong was to consult a doctor as soon as influenza-like symptoms are experienced, which could potentially have a greater impact on mi events due to influenza outbreaks.",PMC3100509,PMC3100509_4
