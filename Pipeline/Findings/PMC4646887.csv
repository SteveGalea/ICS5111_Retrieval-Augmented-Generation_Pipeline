[18F]-FDG-PET/CT can provide biomarkers for host immune response to MERS-CoV through noninvasive longitudinal imaging.,PMC4646887,PMC4646887_0
Increased [18F]-FDG uptake in activated immune cells in response to virus entry can be localized by PET imaging.,PMC4646887,PMC4646887_1
Ki (influx rate constant) in responsive lymphoid tissue can be calculated using image-derived input function in [18F]-FDG-PET/CT.,PMC4646887,PMC4646887_2
Alterations in Ki associated with time point and location of lymphoid tissue were revealed after MERS-CoV exposure.,PMC4646887,PMC4646887_3
"[18F]-FDG-PET is able to detect subtle changes in host immune response to contain subclinical virus infection, and full quantitative analysis is preferred over semiquantitative analysis using standardized uptake value.",PMC4646887,PMC4646887_4
