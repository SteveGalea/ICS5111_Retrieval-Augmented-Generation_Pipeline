The authors demonstrated for the first time that egr1 can be rapidly induced by HSV-1 lytic infection in epithelial cells such as Vero and SIRC.,PMC3120787,PMC3120787_0
"The authors showed that EGR1 induction during HSV-1 lytic infection in corneal cells could have implications in viral pathogenesis, inflammation, and disease progression.",PMC3120787,PMC3120787_1
The authors determined that EGR1 induction during HSV-1 lytic infection is likely due to transactivation by the NFKB and/or CREB-mediated signaling cascades.,PMC3120787,PMC3120787_2
"The authors identified the presence of NFKB regulatory sequences and CREB binding protein in the human EGR1 promoter, suggesting a role for EGR1 in regulating the activity of both ICPL22 and ICPL4.",PMC3120787,PMC3120787_3
"The authors reported that EGR1 induction during HSV-1 lytic infection is sufficient to interact with the ICPL22 EBE during the lytic infection of SIRC and that overexpression of EGR1 enhanced HSV-1 gene expression, replication, and release of infectious viruses (unpublished data).",PMC3120787,PMC3120787_4
