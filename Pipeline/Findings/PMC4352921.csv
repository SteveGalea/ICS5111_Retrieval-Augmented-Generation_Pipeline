"In the context of osteonecrosis repair, the study identified two distinct patterns of repair: 'reparative osteogenesis' and 'destructive repair'.",PMC4352921,PMC4352921_0
"In the context of micro-vascular density, the study found that the total number of micro-vessels in osteonecrotic lesions could be quantified using a histogram generated using Excel 2007.",PMC4352921,PMC4352921_1
"In the context of edema area, the study used a histological section scanned by Omni to identify the interstitial marrow edema zone by thresholding using ImageJ 1.32j.",PMC4352921,PMC4352921_2
"In the context of protein expression level, the study used homogenates pre-centrifuged at 2,500 g for 10 minutes at 4°C and the collected supernatant transferred to a PVDF membrane to determine the protein concentration of the tissue lysate.",PMC4352921,PMC4352921_3
"In the context of local phosphorylated Src protein and total Src protein expression, the study used a trans-blot SD semi-dry transfer cell to incubate the membrane with primary antibody and a secondary antibody for 1 hour. The proteins (Src-phospho-Y418) were visualized by chemiluminescence with the eCL Plus immunoblotting detection system (Pierce). The Src-phospho-Y418 and total Src expressions were normalized to the band intensity of β-actin using ImageJ 1.32j.",PMC4352921,PMC4352921_4
