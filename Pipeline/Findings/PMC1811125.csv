"In a study on the role of interleukin-13 (IL-13) in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, the authors found that overexpression of IL-13 reduced viral titers, diminished lung interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production, and protected against RSV-induced weight loss. In contrast, mice deficient in IL-13 had higher viral titers and increased lung IFN-γ production. Administration of a neutralizing antibody against IL-13 in mice infected with RSV resulted in reduced viral antigen levels in lung homogenates, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for RSV proteins, but the authors did not measure viral titers or lung IFN-γ production in these experiments.",PMC1811125,PMC1811125_0
"The authors also found that IL-13 served a protective role during RSV infection in both IL-13-overexpressing mice and mice treated with a neutralizing antibody against IL-13, and that IL-13 deficiency increased viral titers and lung IFN-γ production.",PMC1811125,PMC1811125_1
"The authors noted that IL-13 and IL-4 induced similar biological functions, as both trigger the Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling pathway through the shared IL-4Rα chain of their receptors. However, the authors also found that IL-4 has been shown to increase the virulence of poxvirus infection and is associated with a reduction in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursor frequency, while IL-13 has been shown to protect against RSV-induced weight loss and does not alter the frequency of IFN-γ-producing CTL.",PMC1811125,PMC1811125_2
"The authors noted that IL-13 overexpression in IL-13-overexpressing mice increased surfactant proteins (SP)-A, -B, and -C two-fold, and SP-D was increased 70-fold over levels found in non-transgenic littermates, but deficiency of IL-13 did not alter either SP-A or SP-D levels in balb/c mice.",PMC1811125,PMC1811125_3
The authors also noted that IL-13 overexpression reduced viral tit,PMC1811125,PMC1811125_4
