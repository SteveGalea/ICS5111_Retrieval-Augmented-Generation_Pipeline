"This study surveyed the detection rate of respiratory viruses in children with Kawasaki disease (KD) using multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and found that the virus detection rate was not significantly different between KD patients and control subjects, suggesting that identification of respiratory viruses during the diagnostic evaluation of febrile children with respiratory symptoms cannot be used as exclusive evidence against the diagnosis of KD.",PMC3534160,PMC3534160_0
"The study found no significant association between the prevalence of respiratory viruses and the incidence of KD, indicating that the existence of respiratory symptoms was not related to the result of RT-PCR in KD patients.",PMC3534160,PMC3534160_1
"The study compared characteristics of two patient subgroups divided on the basis of results of RT-PCR and found no significant differences in terms of clinical findings, including the prevalence of incomplete presentation of the disease and coronary artery diameters.",PMC3534160,PMC3534160_2
"The study found no significant difference in the virus detection rate between KD patients and control subjects for any of the 15 respiratory viruses tested, including respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, influenza viruses A and B, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus OC43/229E, and enterovirus.",PMC3534160,PMC3534160_3
"The study suggests that a positive RT-PCR for currently epidemic respiratory viruses should not be used as an evidence against the diagnosis of KD, as these viruses were not associated with the incomplete presentation of KD and coronary artery dilatation.",PMC3534160,PMC3534160_4
