"The most important finding regarding the m1058l substitution in the fcov s protein is that it does not correlate with fip disease phenotype, as previously proposed by Chang et al. (2013). The study found that a significant number (9%) of tissue samples that did not show the m1058l substitution still encoded the s1060a substitution, suggesting that changes in the fusogenic activity of the fcov s protein, including but not limited to these substitutions, could be representative of a class of mutations that influence the pathogenesis of fip (13).",PMC4006447,PMC4006447_0
"The study found that a far greater proportion (81%) of faecal samples from cats with fip were fcov qrt-pcr positive, and their relative copy numbers were significantly higher than those of faecal samples from cats without fip. This suggests that these cats were shedding an enteric form of the virus, and potentially, a systemic form of the virus as well, as a smaller but significant proportion (23%) of faecal samples from cats with fip provided fcov rna samples encoding leucine at position 1058 (13).",PMC4006447,PMC4006447_1
"The study also found that a larger number (77%) of faecal samples from cats without fip encoded methionine at position 1058, indicative of infection with the enteric form of the virus (13).",PMC4006447,PMC4006447_2
"The study identified that a mixed population of rnas encoding for either methionine or leucine at position 1058 was present in a single tissue sample taken from a cat without fip (cat 60). This suggests that the m1058l substitution in the faecal sample was a relatively recent event, and the virus had not yet spread systemically (13).",PMC4006447,PMC4006447_3
"The study demonstrated that the pyrosequencing approach is a rapid and accurate method to identify single nucleotide differences at a specific position within a dna fragment, or in this case, a viral genome (13). However, it has some limitations, as some samples required 50 cycles of pcr amplification to generate adequate amounts of dna for sequencing, and some samples did not produce sufficient pcr products for pyrosequencing, even after 50 amplification",PMC4006447,PMC4006447_4
