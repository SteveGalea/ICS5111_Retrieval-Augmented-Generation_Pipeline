"The study identified 35 coronavirus-positive samples from 10 different bat species in China, representing approximately 6% of the 120 bat species identified in the country. The bat coronaviruses clustered into five distinct groups, with one group (group 5) being highly divergent from existing groups and containing viruses only from bats.",PMC1563713,PMC1563713_0
"The study revealed high genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats, with some viruses falling between established groups, suggesting intermediate strains. The s gene and other genes in some bat coronaviruses were highly divergent and ambiguously aligned, and the different phylogenies were unlikely due to variation in the rates of substitution.",PMC1563713,PMC1563713_1
"The study found that many novel coronaviruses cannot be easily accommodated in the current classification, as antigenic data were not available in many cases due to difficulty in virus isolation. The results of the study suggest that based on phylogenetic relationships, low genetic similarity, and unique genome organization, some of these novel coronaviruses are intermediate strains that fall between established groups.",PMC1563713,PMC1563713_2
"The study found that coronaviruses in bats exhibit high genetic diversity and high prevalence across a wide geographical distribution, possibly with asymptomatic or persistent infection. The study also revealed that bats appear to be ideal candidates for the natural reservoirs of all coronaviruses due to their high genetic diversity, high prevalence across a wide geographical distribution, and large population sizes and densities, as well as their ability to migrate.",PMC1563713,PMC1563713_3
"The study found that the bat coronaviruses tested had the classical coronavirus genome organization, but some bat coronaviruses had a large noncoding region at the start of the genome in which the pl domain could not be identified, and some had three orfs between the s and e genes. These findings suggest that some of these novel coronaviruses are intermediate strains that fall between established groups.",PMC1563713,PMC1563713_4
