Antibiotic resistance in microbes likely existed before the modern era of antibiotics due to the use of toxic chemicals like arsenicals and mercurials for centuries.,PMC5287056,PMC5287056_0
Genetically determined resistance to toxic chemicals like arsenic and mercury was likely spread during the intense pollution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.,PMC5287056,PMC5287056_1
"The discovery of antibiotic resistance genes that modify (inactivate) antibiotics led to the development of blocking agents to restore antibiotic activity, but modified resistance modifications have emerged, highlighting the inevitable development of resistance.",PMC5287056,PMC5287056_2
"Antibiotic resistomes, conglomerations of putative resistance genes isolated from various environmental sources, have been discovered, but their natural functions and origins are still unclear.",PMC5287056,PMC5287056_3
"The widespread use of antibiotics, especially in agriculture and as food supplements for animals and fish, has led to the irreversible development of multidrug resistance and has only been partly successful in controlling misuses. Strict control of antibiotic use, elimination of remaining residues, and constant monitoring are necessary to prevent overuse and disposal of antimicrobials in their active forms. Nonhuman use of antibiotics should be universally banned except for specific agents that are structurally and completely unrelated in mode-of-action to compounds used for humans.",PMC5287056,PMC5287056_4
