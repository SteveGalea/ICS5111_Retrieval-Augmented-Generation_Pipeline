"The study involved a limited number of patients with respiratory failure, making it difficult to establish a control group with favorable conditions.",PMC5295477,PMC5295477_0
The authors developed an ecmo transport system using general-service ambulances due to limited funds and economic burdens associated with other options for patients.,PMC5295477,PMC5295477_1
"Patients with respiratory failure were transported using ambu-bag ventilation, and ecmo experts and clinical perfusionists with nursing experience were included in the transport team to cope with any problems that may occur during transport.",PMC5295477,PMC5295477_2
"The authors identified no difficulty in maintaining proper blood oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations during transport, and the time needed to prepare the equipment did not impede the rapid deployment of a general-service ambulance.",PMC5295477,PMC5295477_3
"The authors believe that their ecmo transport system with ambu-bag ventilation is a safe and useful interhospital transport method for respiratory failure patients, as it can be established without a financial burden on the developing organization and is a good alternative option for ecmo interhospital transport systems in Korean hospitals with limited resources.",PMC5295477,PMC5295477_4
