"In a cohort of children hospitalized with pneumonia in Beijing, China, between 2007 and 2015, rsv infection showed distinctive seasonal patterns with a highly sensitive method (pcr-based testing). Over 90% of rsv-positive pcrs could be captured during the rsv season for all 8 study years, and the average capture was 97% for 2007–2015 combined.",PMC6537707,PMC6537707_0
"The prevailing rsv subgroup in a given season appears to affect the timing of rsv activity. Alternating shifts between rsv-a and rsv-b, every 2 years, have been observed in previous studies, and our study found that the positivity for rsv-a (19%) was significantly higher than that for rsv-b (11%) in Beijing, China.",PMC6537707,PMC6537707_1
"Children hospitalized with pneumonia in Beijing, China, between 2007 and 2015, with a median age of 12 months, showed a highly significant monotonic decreasing effect on the activity of rsv with age. Children who were in their first months of life had the highest risk for rsv infection (3,30).",PMC6537707,PMC6537707_2
The shifting in dominance from rsv-a to rsv-b every 2 years might play a key role in driving rsv transmission dynamics in populations. This observation suggests that genotyping in rsv surveillance is significant and could indicate the significance of genotyping in rsv surveillance.,PMC6537707,PMC6537707_3
"The response plot showing the effect of year on rsv activity also indicated patterns of regular peaks in the years rsv-a prevailed (i.e., 2007–08, 2010–11, 2011–12, and 2014–15), but the effect of the year diminished when rsv-a–prevailing year was adjusted for as a factor in the model, suggesting that repeated shifting between rsv-a and rsv-b might explain the alternating early-big or late-small pattern and year-to-year variation in epidemic size and timing of rsv transmission observed previously.",PMC6537707,PMC6537707_4
