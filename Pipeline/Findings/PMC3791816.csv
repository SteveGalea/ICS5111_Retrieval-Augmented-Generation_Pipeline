"The pp-nt assay, which uses pseudotyped influenza viruses, shows strong correlation with classical serological assays such as ha and mn for detecting neutralizing antibody responses against all subtypes of influenza viruses. The pp-nt assay has a higher numerical titer compared to mn, and appears to be more sensitive as it allows the binding of antibodies not only on antigenic sites of ha surface but also on the ha stalk.",PMC3791816,PMC3791816_0
"The pp-nt assay using a gfp reporter instead of firefly luciferase shows a clear correlation and a strong neutralizing profile although no correlate of protection has been yet established for pp-nt assay. However, the specificity that can be gained by the use of influenza pseudotypes considering that the cut-off for negative sera was assigned for ic50 values equivalent or below 1 × 101, and h5 and h7 pseudotypes showed some degree of cross-reactivity with sera generated from viruses belonging to the same ha groups.",PMC3791816,PMC3791816_1
"The measurement of neutralizing antibody responses is critical for influenza serodiagnosis, for the evaluation of vaccine effectiveness against drift variants arising as a consequence of vaccine pressure, and for improving both the evaluation of vaccine effectiveness and vaccine virus strain selection.",PMC3791816,PMC3791816_2
A new panel of reference sera will need to be prepared for use with pseudotype-based assays as they become more widely used in the future.,PMC3791816,PMC3791816_3
"The pp-nt assay represents a reliable and safe test to determine neutralizing antibody responses to all subtypes of influenza viruses, and it has the potential to be used in resource-limited countries where the cost-benefit of this assay could be increased by the availability of different reporter systems, such as gfp reporter instead of firefly luciferase, or β-galactosidase reporters for laboratories lacking fluorescence or luciferase detection capability.",PMC3791816,PMC3791816_4
