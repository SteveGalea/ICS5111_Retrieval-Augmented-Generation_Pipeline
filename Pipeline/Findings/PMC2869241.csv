"In a study on the inhibitory activities of andrographolide derivatives on α-glucosidase, a set of 25 compounds was investigated.",PMC2869241,PMC2869241_0
The molecular structures of the compounds were analyzed using quantum chemical calculation (QCC) and molecular modeling (MM) methods.,PMC2869241,PMC2869241_1
"A 2D quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model was established based on the atomic connection of molecules, indicating that there might be three key groups associated with biological activity.",PMC2869241,PMC2869241_2
"A 3D QSAR model was developed based on molecular properties belonging to steric, hydrophobic, and h-acceptor fields. This model suggested that compounds with structures fitting better into the 3D contour maps of model 16 had more potent activities.",PMC2869241,PMC2869241_3
"Combining the results of both QSAR models, the key fragments and their spatial distribution could be efficiently identified, and the developed QSAR model could be used to predict the inhibitory activities of unknown andrographolide derivatives on α-glucosidase.",PMC2869241,PMC2869241_4
