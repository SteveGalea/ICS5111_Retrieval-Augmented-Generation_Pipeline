Direct detection tests for early active infection in lyme disease are technically achievable due to advancements in molecular and genomic technologies.,PMC6399434,PMC6399434_0
"PCR strategies have shown promise in detecting low abundances of Borrelia burgdorferi in blood, as well as in other studies with sensitivities increased by combining multiple consecutive methods.",PMC6399434,PMC6399434_1
Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have shown success in detecting causative agents of sepsis and Ebola with sensitivities increased by combining multiple consecutive methods.,PMC6399434,PMC6399434_2
"Challenges remain, including our incomplete knowledge of the full breadth of Borrelia genomic diversity and the need for cost-benefit factors and attention to the risk of exogenous contamination and degradation of nucleic acid during transport to the laboratory.",PMC6399434,PMC6399434_3
"Continued reliance on serologic testing for early lyme disease is suboptimal due to the common 2-3 week seronegative window with current methods and the need for a biomarker of active infection. Direct tests for borrelia burgdorferi infection, including nucleic acid and protein detections, would complement improving indirect serological tests for more comprehensive diagnosis of lyme disease.",PMC6399434,PMC6399434_4
