Limited sensitivity of commercially available ns1 antigen tests to denv-4 serotype compared to other serotypes revealed in evaluation studies.,PMC5801815,PMC5801815_0
Development of a new ns1 antigen detection test with improved sensitivity to denv-4 is needed due to the serious global health significance of dengue caused by one of the four serologically distinct dengue viruses.,PMC5801815,PMC5801815_1
Use of a small-ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo*) cloning vector to express a sumo*-denv-4 rns1 fusion protein to develop ns1 denv-4 specific monoclonal antibodies.,PMC5801815,PMC5801815_2
"Identification of three denv-4 specific anti-ns1 mabs: 3h7a9, 8a6f2, and 6d4b10, with mab 8a6f2 as the capture antibody and 6d4b10 as a detection antibody, for use in a denv-4 serotype-specific ns1 capture enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA).",PMC5801815,PMC5801815_3
"Sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed ELISA for denv-4 with no cross-reactivity to other denv serotypes or heterologous flaviviruses, indicating the usefulness of the mabs for the development of denv-4 immunodiagnostic tests.",PMC5801815,PMC5801815_4
