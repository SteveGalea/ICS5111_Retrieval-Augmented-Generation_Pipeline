"This exploratory digital epidemiologic study provides evidence that internet surveillance is a rapid and efficient way to evaluate public reactions during the study period of a public health emergency, as it allows for real-time monitoring, which can be timely to know public reactions to the outbreak because it is a real-time surveillance during the emergencies and also it is very economical without consuming too many resources.",PMC3906895,PMC3906895_0
"The indexes of public reaction, daily posted and forwarded number and bai, to h7n9 outbreaks, were significantly higher in 7 provinces/cities with human h7n9 cases than those in 2 provinces without cases, and both daily posted and forwarded number and bai were positively associated with the cumulative case fatality rate of human h7n9 infection, indicating that the first 3 days of the outbreak was the period when internet attentions rose rapidly, and the high public attention would last for a week, which is a good time for the department of emergency control and prevention to disseminate health education knowledge and skills through network and social media.",PMC3906895,PMC3906895_1
"This study showed that the public reaction was positively associated with the cumulative case fatality rate but not daily number of cases, and when the case fatality rate was high, the public attention was high, and the public attention decreased with a decrease in case fatality rate, indicating that the public attention decreases when the threat from the epidemic disease decreases.",PMC3906895,PMC3906895_2
"This study showed that rumors generate and occur early during the period of public health emergency, and most of the rumors claimed that h7n9 avian influenza cases occurred in the local areas, indicating that the uncertainty of emerging infectious diseases often generates the rumors, and it also suggests the importance of early information release.",PMC3906895,PMC3906895_3
"This study showed that when there were new cases reported in a new province/city, the daily posted and forwarded number and bai increased significantly, especially in the local province/city, indicating that the extension of epidemic area triggered more public attention than the increase of reported cases in the original outbreak areas, and it implies that extra methods should be taken when the epidemic area is expanded.",PMC3906895,PMC3906895_4
