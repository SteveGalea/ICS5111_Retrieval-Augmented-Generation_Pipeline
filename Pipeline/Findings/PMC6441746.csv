"The case presented is remarkable for both the epidemiological investigation required to make the diagnosis and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in this infection, as it is only the second report of ECMO use for leptospirosis in the United States.",PMC6441746,PMC6441746_0
"The patient presented with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) syndrome due to leptospirosis pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (LPHS), which is a rare, sometimes life-threatening manifestation of several unrelated diseases.",PMC6441746,PMC6441746_1
"The diagnosis of DAH with capillaritis, where there is profound neutrophil infiltration into the peri-capillary and pulmonary interstitial spaces, is typically made by bronchoscopic alveolar lavage with increasing bloody return on each subsequent lavage.",PMC6441746,PMC6441746_2
"The majority of cases of leptospirosis are not suspected at presentation, despite its increasing number of case reports documented in the last two decades, as even in Hawaii, the majority of cases are not suspected at presentation.",PMC6441746,PMC6441746_3
"Treatment should include penicillin, doxycycline, or a third-generation cephalosporin, as severe disease complicates 5–15% of infections, and pulmonary involvement occurs in 20–70% of leptospirosis cases. The case described here received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for 10 days and did recover.",PMC6441746,PMC6441746_4
