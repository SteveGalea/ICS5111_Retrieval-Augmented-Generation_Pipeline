"A study in Taiwan found that individuals with higher neighborhood-level social capital were more likely to have the intention to wear a face mask and wash their hands more frequently during an influenza pandemic. Bonding social capital, which refers to social connections within a community, was associated with all types of behavioral intention, while bridging social capital, which refers to social connections outside a person's usual social network, was only associated with the intention to wear a face mask. This study highlights the importance of promoting bonding social capital and linking social capital as crucial for resolving health emergencies.",PMC4398366,PMC4398366_0
"The study found that perceived severity of the disease was associated with the intention to receive vaccination and wear a face mask but was not associated with the intention to wash hands more frequently. This suggests that the higher the perceived severity of the disease, the higher the cost (i.e., expense of receiving a flu shot) the person is willing to pay to implement a health measure.",PMC4398366,PMC4398366_1
"The study found that men and higher-income people were more likely to have the intention to receive vaccination, which is consistent with previous studies. However, these relationships did not apply to the intention of washing their hands and wearing a face mask.",PMC4398366,PMC4398366_2
The study found that people with higher education demonstrated a higher intention than did lower-educated people to receive vaccination and wear a face mask. This finding is related to gender differences regarding the belief of the effectiveness of vaccination and the perceived expense of receiving a new type of flu shot.,PMC4398366,PMC4398366_3
"The study found that respondents with higher education were more likely to have the intention to receive vaccination and wear a face mask, but these relationships did not apply to the intention of washing their hands more frequently. This finding may be related to gender differences regarding the belief of the effectiveness of vaccination and the perceived expense of receiving a new type of flu shot. However, further research is needed to confirm these relationships.",PMC4398366,PMC4398366_4
