"Dendritic cells (DCs) activated by the viral mimic lipopolysaccharide (pi:C) display an atypical transcriptome signature that includes the induction of the transcription factor Atf4, but unlike in fibroblasts, DCs are not affected by pi:C-induced translation inhibition.",PMC3286954,PMC3286954_0
"In DCs, Atf4 and gadd34, both induced by pi:C, are required for the normal production of interferon (IFN)-beta and IL-6, but their inactivation does not significantly impact protein synthesis in response to pi:C.",PMC3286954,PMC3286954_1
"Gadd34/PP1 is required for the dephosphorylation/activation of a key factor in the signal transduction pathway downstream of trif, but its inactivation does not overly impact translational control.",PMC3286954,PMC3286954_2
"DCs display an increased level of phosphorylated eIF2 alpha (p-eIF2 alpha), but unlike in fibroblasts, this does not lead to translation inhibition.",PMC3286954,PMC3286954_3
"Gadd34 is not required for the optimization of cytokine production in response to viral infection in DCs, but it is required for normal IFN-beta and IL-6 production in DCs and in deficient mouse in vivo.",PMC3286954,PMC3286954_4
