"The authors introduce a novel approach, called reduced iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton (rirgn), to estimate parameters and generate forecasts for epidemics using the generalized Richards equation, a simple phenomenological 4-parameter model. This method combines regularization techniques with a reduced hessian approximation, which lowers the condition number and enforces a symmetric non-negative definite structure.",PMC6002070,PMC6002070_0
"The authors apply their method to estimate parameters and generate forecasts for the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemics in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone using early incident reported data. They find that the method is effective in tracking the epidemics in Liberia and Sierra Leone, but has more difficulties with the multi-mode nature of the epidemic in Guinea.",PMC6002070,PMC6002070_1
"The authors highlight the importance of choosing the right regularization sequence, {α₀ₙ}, to ensure stability and reduce excessive noise propagation. They also discuss the role of prior knowledge in selecting the initial vector, q₀, and the reference vector, qₖ, in the penalty term.",PMC6002070,PMC6002070_2
"The authors note that their method could be adapted to analyze outbreaks of other disease systems, such as avian influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Zika. They suggest that disease forecasts could be generated in real time with updates every few weeks or so, depending on the disease system.",PMC6002070,PMC6002070_3
"The authors emphasize the potential of rigorous mathematical approaches for generating reliable parameter estimates and useful epidemic forecasts in the context of the generalized Richards equation, a simple phenomenological 4-parameter model, and highlight the need for careful linking of mathematical models with regularization techniques to achieve stable parameter estimation and associated forward projections.",PMC6002070,PMC6002070_4
