"The current study identifies the c-terminal half of the crd1 segment of elr1 as the critical domain mediating gp90 binding, and leu70 as the critical residue within this domain necessary for functional binding of elr1 to gp90.",PMC2224449,PMC2224449_0
"Substitution of the his70 residue in murine hvea with amino acids containing aromatic side chains or charged side chains fails to produce gp90 binding, while substitutions with amino acids containing hydrophobic alkyl side chains result in gp90 binding and function as a receptor for eiav infection.",PMC2224449,PMC2224449_1
"The results suggest that not only is hydrophobic important, but also the size and shape of the side chain for the amino acid at residue position 70 are critical for optimal envelope-receptor binding.",PMC2224449,PMC2224449_2
"The molecular modeling studies of the crd1 domain indicate that the hydrophobic leu in the Î²-turn projects outward, dominating the surface profile of this putative binding determinant, and that the properties of this side chain are critical for binding to the receptor binding groove of the eiav envelope.",PMC2224449,PMC2224449_3
"Comparison of the predicted three-dimensional structures for cd134 and elr1 reveals that the cd134 asp60 is at the same position as the leu70 of elr1, and suggests common themes in the use of tnfr family proteins as virus receptors and also reveals common structural motifs in the envelope proteins of these diverse viruses that are utilized for receptor binding.",PMC2224449,PMC2224449_4
