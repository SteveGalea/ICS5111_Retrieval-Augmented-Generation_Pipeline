"The study identified a potential for ibv to encode extra proteins beyond the known reading frames, which could have implications for the understanding of the virus's pathogenesis (Bentley et al., 2013).",PMC5410111,PMC5410111_0
"The analysis of purified ibv revealed the presence of a number of previously uncharacterized proteins, including those associated with cellular metabolism, virulence, and host-cell interactions (Denton et al., 2015).",PMC5410111,PMC5410111_1
"The study found that ibv in chicken eggs is able to propagate and purify using the method of Dent and Neuman (2015), providing a valuable resource for further studies on the virus's pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.",PMC5410111,PMC5410111_2
