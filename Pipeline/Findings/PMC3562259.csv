"Among the five hepatotropic hepatitis viruses, only hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) have not yet developed an in vitro infection system in cell culture.",PMC3562259,PMC3562259_0
"HBV infection demands both intracellular and cell-surface factors, and the failure of HBV infection is largely due to strict restriction on the interaction between HBV virions and cell membrane.",PMC3562259,PMC3562259_1
"The molecules on the cell membrane needed for HBV infection can be divided into two classes: low affinity and high affinity molecules. The high affinity membrane partners for HBV remain elusive, but the authors identified one cellular protein, NTCP, which is a transmembrane protein that mediates bile acid transport and is located in the lateral surface (canalicular) of hepatocytes.",PMC3562259,PMC3562259_2
"NTCP was found to be necessary for HBV infection, and the authors could convert cell lines previously non-permissible to HBV infection to permissible by over-expressing NTCP, which supports its possible role in the HBV infection process.",PMC3562259,PMC3562259_3
"The authors identified a stretch of 10 amino acids in the NTCP transmembrane domain as the motif directly interacting with the HBV envelope proteins, but other cellular or viral factors have to be discovered and demonstrated to enhance the efficiency of viral infection, as NTCP itself is not sufficient to allow HBV infection.",PMC3562259,PMC3562259_4
