"In the convalescent phase, patients with pulmonary fibrotic changes and avascular necrosis of the femoral head require follow-up studies for a longer duration, including comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management of any persistent or emerging sequelae. These types of investigation may facilitate the search for effective therapeutics and aid in ultimately conquering this disease.",PMC545044,PMC545044_4
