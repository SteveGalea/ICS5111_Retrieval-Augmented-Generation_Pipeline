"The study provides the first nationwide epidemiologic and phylogenetic description of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in humans in Saudi Arabia, allowing for a better understanding of transmission during a period of continuous frequent reporting of new cases.",PMC5712457,PMC5712457_0
"The study demonstrates the emergence, persistent circulation, and eventual predominance of a recently identified recombinant MERS-CoV clade in humans among samples collected since January 2015 from geographically distant communities in Saudi Arabia.",PMC5712457,PMC5712457_1
"The study confirms the probable signature recombination event between two different parental clade B viruses involving a region of the ORF1ab and spike genes, revealed by recent reports and documented a probable signature recombination event between December 2013 and June 2014 in Saudi Arabia and China.",PMC5712457,PMC5712457_2
"The study highlights the importance of strengthened epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance, as most cases identified in Saudi Arabia in February had documented exposure to healthcare facilities, and 17% of investigated cases experienced MERS-CoV infection clusters in healthcare facilities.",PMC5712457,PMC5712457_3
The study recommends reinforcing recommendations to limit visitation in facilities with ongoing MERS-CoV transmission and limiting healthcare-associated MERS-CoV transmission by strengthening epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance.,PMC5712457,PMC5712457_4
The study notes that virus transmission dynamics within and between human and nonhuman sources of MERS-CoV will likely influence transmission routes in ways not yet fully understood.,PMC5712457,PMC5712457_5
The study highlights the need for ongoing intensive epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance to better understand MERS-CoV transmission and to focus infection prevention and control efforts.,PMC5712457,PMC5712457_6
"The study suggests that the increasing prevalence of the recombinant virus in humans among samples collected since January 2015 from geographically distant communities in Saudi Arabia might reflect multiple introductions from camels with similar strains, and virus transmission dynamics within and between human and nonhuman sources of MERS-CoV might also be a factor.",PMC5712457,PMC5712457_7
"The study notes that, based on recent phylogeny of MERS-CoV sequences from camels in Saudi Arabia, the novel recombinant subclade (referred to as nrc-2015 in the manuscript) was also predominant in camels during a period",PMC5712457,PMC5712457_8
