"Avian influenza virus (dhav) causes damage to hepatocytes by oxidative stress, leading to increased pathological damage in poultry. Supplementation of icariin, phosphorylated icariin, and baicalin-linarin-notoginsenoside r1 (blin) decreases the hepatocyte damage caused by dhav by alleviating the oxidative stress.",PMC6311761,PMC6311761_0
"Duck hepatitis virus (dhv) infection of duck embryo hepatocytes increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, decreases gSH content and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and increases serum levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO). These findings indicate the involvement of oxidative stress in dhv infection.",PMC6311761,PMC6311761_1
"Infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) infection of bursal lymphocytes increases intracellular ROS levels, decreases gSH content and activities of GPx and SOD, and increases serum levels of LPO. The increased level of ROS may be involved in the shutoff of cellular protein synthesis.",PMC6311761,PMC6311761_2
"Marek's disease virus (mdv) infection of chickens leads to increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) and decreased activities of SOD, catalase (CAT), glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (GSH-PD), and glutathione reductase (GR) in the spleen, thymus, bursa, heart, liver, kidneys, and gonads. These findings indicate the involvement of oxidative stress in mdv infection.",PMC6311761,PMC6311761_3
Avian leukosis virus (alv-j) infection of spleen-derived macrophages does not significantly increase the production of nitric oxide (NO) in contrast to the results in monocyte-derived macrophages. These findings indicate the selective involvement of oxidative stress in alv-j infection in chicken.,PMC6311761,PMC6311761_4
