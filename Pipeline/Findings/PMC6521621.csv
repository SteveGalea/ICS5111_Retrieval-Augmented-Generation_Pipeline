"Viral envelope proteins, such as HIV-1 env, are targeted by multiple antiviral factors to restrict virus entry and spread.",PMC6521621,PMC6521621_0
"These factors include restriction factors that impair virus infectivity, such as tetherin and serinc5, as well as factors that alter glycosylation or cleavage of env, such as FUT2 and VPR.",PMC6521621,PMC6521621_1
"Viral envelope proteins also face pressure from innate and adaptive immune responses, which can drive viral evolution and adaptation.",PMC6521621,PMC6521621_2
"Some viruses, such as Ebola and Marburg, have also been found to use their envelope glycoproteins to antagonize tetherin and other restriction factors.",PMC6521621,PMC6521621_3
"Understanding the mechanisms by which these factors restrict virus entry and spread, as well as the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses, may lead to new approaches for treating and even curing viral infections, as demonstrated by the use of trim5Î± in gene therapy to create HIV-resistant hematopoietic stem cells.",PMC6521621,PMC6521621_4
