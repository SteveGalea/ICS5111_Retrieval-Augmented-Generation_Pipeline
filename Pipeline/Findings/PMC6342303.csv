"The study found that wearing full body suits and powered-air-purifying-respirators (ppr) protect from exposure to pathogens but constrict mobility, view, and cause heat stress, leading to increased error rates due to fatigue.",PMC6342303,PMC6342303_0
"The study demonstrated that effects of fatigue had less impact than training effects under these experimental conditions, as shown by continuous decreases in reaction times with increasing numbers of task series.",PMC6342303,PMC6342303_1
"The study revealed that for suit b, restricted view caused by the flexible face shield was the most relevant parameter, while for suit a, increased temperature and sweating as a result of head ventilation led to back pain.",PMC6342303,PMC6342303_2
The study showed that both suit types were well tolerated when performing different tasks related to sample processing and analyses necessary when protection of healthcare workers by ppe is required.,PMC6342303,PMC6342303_3
"The study provided data on the impact of wearing ppe under prolonged and stressful working conditions on error rates, which can be of value for defining working procedures and safety measures during future pandemics.",PMC6342303,PMC6342303_4
