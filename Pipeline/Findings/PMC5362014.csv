"The study found that the prevalence of feline leukaemia virus (felv) antigenaemia in eastern Austria between 1996 and 2011 was 5.6%, which is similar to the prevalence reported in neighbouring countries such as the Czech Republic and Germany in the 1990s.",PMC5362014,PMC5362014_0
"The majority (82%) of felv antigenaemic cats in this study were aged â‰¤5 years, which is higher than the prevalence reported in neighbouring countries such as Germany in the mid-1990s but has not significantly decreased over the past 16 years.",PMC5362014,PMC5362014_1
"The study confirmed the importance of continued and regular vaccination against felv among Austrian cats, particularly those allowed access to the outdoors, as the prevalence has not significantly decreased over this period.",PMC5362014,PMC5362014_2
"The study highlighted the need for repeat testing with either an immunofluorescence assay or provirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as confirmatory tests for felv infection, as up to 10% of cats tested and found to be negative for felv antigen may still be provirus positive when analysed by PCR.",PMC5362014,PMC5362014_3
"The study also emphasised the importance of considering factors relating to the cats' household situations, such as whether the animal was clinically symptomatic, indoor dwelling, or free roaming, as well as whether the animals were being retested, to ensure that no cats with false-positive results are ever erroneously euthanised.",PMC5362014,PMC5362014_4
