"In vitro studies of cultured cells indicate that epec and etec can mutually enhance the virulence of the other in multiple ways. First, epec infection sensitizes cells to the effects of sta, as manifested by an increase in cyclic gmp accumulation to the toxin. Second, etec toxins synergistically increase epec-induced atp release from host cells. Third, adenine nucleotides act additively with etec toxins to trigger chloride secretion in intestinal tissues. Fourth, adenosine and adenine nucleotides act additively or synergistically with ct and lt to induce vacuole formation in t84 cells.",PMC1418639,PMC1418639_0
"Dual infections with epec and etec have frequently been noted in studies of diarrhea in children, but these were not recognized as examples of a microbial interaction because until now, no molecular mechanism had been identified for such an epec-etec interaction.",PMC1418639,PMC1418639_1
"The interaction between epec and the sta enterotoxin involves activation of host pkc by epec, followed by pkc-mediated phosphorylation of guanylyl cyclase c, the receptor for sta.",PMC1418639,PMC1418639_2
"The interaction between adenosine and toxins in triggering vacuole formation may also involve the cftr, as well as potassium and other ion channels.",PMC1418639,PMC1418639_3
"If epec and etec mutually enhance each other's virulence, one might wonder why epec and etec strains have not emerged with the genetic characteristics of both, given the ability of e. Coli for horizontal exchange of genetic material. However, another answer may be that such epec-etec hybrid strains are already starting to emerge, as seen in a foodborne diarrheal outbreak due to an e. Coli strain not fitting into the usual categories for diarrheagenic e. Coli, which had the characteristics of an atypical epec but also expressed the enteroaggregative heat-stable toxin east1, which has the same mechanism of action as sta.",PMC1418639,PMC1418639_4
