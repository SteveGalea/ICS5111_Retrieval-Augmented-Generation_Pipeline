"The study successfully integrated expression cassettes into the chromosome of Lactobacillus casei using a single-plasmid system, eliminating the need for selection requirements and providing genetic stability and conformity with biological safety standards.",PMC4018855,PMC4018855_0
"The study used the pgsa gene product as an anchor for surface display of antigens on L. casei, which was confirmed by laser confocal microscopy, showing green fluorescence on the surface of cells and blue fluorescence in the bodies of cells.",PMC4018855,PMC4018855_1
"The study detected expressed protein from the three newly generated recombinant strains using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), demonstrating that the alpha-toxin genes of these three strains were expressed and that the expressed protein had biological activity.",PMC4018855,PMC4018855_2
"The study found that the newly generated recombinant strains were genetically stable, as all strains remained genetically stable after 40 generations.",PMC4018855,PMC4018855_3
"The study found that the newly generated recombinant strains grew more slowly than wild-type L. casei, in both MRS and SDM media, which may be related to the insertion of the exogenous gene and the fact that the genome is present as a single copy and multiple copies of a plasmid are present in the cell.",PMC4018855,PMC4018855_4
