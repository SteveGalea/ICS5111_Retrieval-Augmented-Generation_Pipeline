"The study identified humoral responses to some of the epitopes on the sars-cov genome, including the membrane (m) and nucleocapsid (n) proteins. These responses may serve as potential markers for the viral infection and be important in vaccine development against this new fatal infectious disease.",PMC1860290,PMC1860290_0
"The study showed strong humoral responses to the membrane (m) protein, which is a relatively small viral structural protein. Antibody against m was found to be common among all the subjects and elicited strong, persistent responses.",PMC1860290,PMC1860290_1
The study found that antibody against m was associated with susceptibility of sars in a locality. This may be useful in diagnostic tests and in surveillance.,PMC1860290,PMC1860290_2
The study showed that the humoral responses to m protein may be important in the development of vaccine for this new fatal infectious disease.,PMC1860290,PMC1860290_3
"The study identified important antigenic sites on the sars-cov genome, which may serve as potential markers for the viral infection and be important in vaccine development against this new fatal infectious disease. These specific antigenic sites may also be important for the design of bedside diagnostic tests.",PMC1860290,PMC1860290_4
