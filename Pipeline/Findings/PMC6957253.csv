"A potential treatment for mers-cov is the use of neutralizing antibodies, either via convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies.",PMC6957253,PMC6957253_0
"Severity of disease is linked to the prevalence of comorbidities, and the availability of donors with sufficiently high neutralizing antibody titer in convalescent plasma might be very limited.",PMC6957253,PMC6957253_1
"Monoclonal antibodies could provide an alternative to convalescent plasma, as mab treatment in rabbits and marmosets reduced viral titer and load in lung tissue, and reduced mortality and morbidity was observed in a mers-cov mouse model.",PMC6957253,PMC6957253_2
"Treatment with mabs reduced the occurrence of severe respiratory symptoms further than hyperimmune plasma did, combined with less gross pathology.",PMC6957253,PMC6957253_3
"The marmosets utilized in this study are outbred, and the significance of genetic factors or differences in immunology cannot be excluded, and when statistical tests were performed excluding the marmoset with no viral load in the respiratory tract, differences in viral load in the lobes of the lower respiratory tract between control and hyperimmune plasma-treated animals were still significant.",PMC6957253,PMC6957253_4
