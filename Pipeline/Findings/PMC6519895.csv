"The SWEDI study, which involves self-initiated, event-driven infectious disease reporting via automated channels, provides a new avenue of research with the aim of reducing short-term absenteeism due to infections and increasing preparedness in the event of serious infectious threats.",PMC6519895,PMC6519895_0
The study covers the entire Swedish season of respiratory infections and provides unique information about the dynamics of viral agent-specific outbreaks/epidemics occurring during nine months in a representative population.,PMC6519895,PMC6519895_1
The constancy of risk factor associations across sociodemographic strata provides comfort for the rule of thumb that independent non-differential disease misclassification with perfect specificity will not bias the risk-ratio estimate.,PMC6519895,PMC6519895_2
"Unlike traditional approaches in infectious disease epidemiology, which focus on identifiable encounters with infected individuals, resulting in dichotomous viral exposure assessments, the assessments in this study are probabilistic in nature, based on observed, period-specific incidence rates in the population and self-reported contact patterns.",PMC6519895,PMC6519895_3
"The SWEDI study provides extensive evaluations of the validity of self-initiated, event-driven infectious disease reports, which have been done in two previous population-based surveillance cohorts, each followed during one infectious disease season. The specificity of these reports is very high, with essentially no false positive reporting, but there is substantial under-reporting, with an estimate of 60%. However, since the reference standard measurements are likely over-estimating the number of disease events due to so-called telescoping bias, the true extent of under-reporting is likely to be of the order of 50%.",PMC6519895,PMC6519895_4
