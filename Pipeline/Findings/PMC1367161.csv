"The study found that hcv, a flavivirus that causes hepatitis C, requires a low-ph-inducible step for productive entry into cells, similar to other enveloped viruses. However, unlike other viruses, the study found that hcv is acid resistant, suggesting a common strategy in the viral life cycles of hcv and pestiviruses, which could either be a result of a common evolutionary origin or production of acid-resistant virions as a common strategy in their life cycles.",PMC1367161,PMC1367161_0
"The study found that the hcv glycoproteins are not activated for low-ph-induced entry by receptor binding alone but require interactions beyond binding at 4째C. This suggests that hcv may require interactions that do not occur during binding at 4째C, such as interaction with a coreceptor to stabilize binding and activate the virus for low-ph-induced entry.",PMC1367161,PMC1367161_1
"The study found that treatment with dtt, a reagent that mimics the action of protein disulfide isomerases at the cell surface or within the endocytic pathway, eliminated detectable hcvcc infection, suggesting that disulfide bond reshuffling is not involved in activation of hcv for productive entry.",PMC1367161,PMC1367161_2
"The study found that simple binding of hcvcc to cells at 4째C was not sufficient to activate the virus for low-ph-induced triggered entry at the plasma membrane, suggesting that hcv entry at the plasma membrane is nonproductive for downstream events in the viral life cycle. However, the study also found that low ph could override the bafilomycin block to hcv infection after incubation at 37째C, indicating that hcv can undergo time- and temperature-dependent activation at the cell surface or in forming endosomes.",PMC1367161,PMC1367161_3
"The study found that the hcvcc system has provided clues to the mechanism of hcv entry, which can now be tested directly, and that future experiments will be aimed at gaining a better understanding of the steps leading to productive hcv entry, paying particular attention to interactions between the hcv glycoproteins and specific molecules required for entry.",PMC1367161,PMC1367161_4
