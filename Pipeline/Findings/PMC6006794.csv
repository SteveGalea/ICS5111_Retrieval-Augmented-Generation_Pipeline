"The review describes the anti-influenza activity of Lactococcus lactis JCM 5805, which has the potential to directly stimulate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdcs) via toll-like receptor (TLR)9 and promote viral control by inducing the production of type 1 interferons (IFNs).",PMC6006794,PMC6006794_0
"The review highlights the role of IFNs in the elimination of pathogenic viruses, which involves the concerted activities of the innate and acquired immune systems.",PMC6006794,PMC6006794_1
"The review notes that probiotics and/or paraprobiotics are considered to be safe, affordable, and easy to consume because of their long history of use in foods.",PMC6006794,PMC6006794_2
"The review mentions that viruses evolve constantly and produce a serologically diverse viral population, making it challenging to establish an effective means of protecting humans from viral infections due to the large number of viral species and their subtypes, as well as the high mutation rate of viruses.",PMC6006794,PMC6006794_3
