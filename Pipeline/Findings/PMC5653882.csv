"The study detected and identified 12 IBV isolates in chicken farms in Bushehr, Iran, with the majority belonging to the variant 2 genotype, which showed high similarity to isolates from the Middle East region.",PMC5653882,PMC5653882_0
"The findings suggest the emergence of new IBV serotypes or variant strains due to only a few changes in the amino acid sequence of the s1 protein, highlighting the importance of antigenic characterization of IBV isolates to select new and appropriate vaccines for corresponding geographical regions.",PMC5653882,PMC5653882_1
"The study reveals the circulation of a variant 2 genotype in chicken farms in Iran, with nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 72.90% to 76.50% and 78.80% to 80.00% with isolates from other Middle East regions, indicating the need for new control strategies and re-arrangement of preventative measures against IBV in Iran.",PMC5653882,PMC5653882_2
"The study confirms the failure of Massachusetts-type vaccine strains in controlling IBV in Iran, with low identity between most of the Iranian isolates and the vaccine strain ranging from 72.90% to 76.50%, highlighting the need for new control strategies and revising the Iranian vaccination strategy against IBV.",PMC5653882,PMC5653882_3
"The study highlights the importance of recognizing the prevalent strain(s) of IBV in a region or country to determine the distribution of virus genotypes and develop and adopt suitable vaccination strategies, as the major problem in the immunization against IBV is the presence of various IBV serotypes in the field against available vaccines.",PMC5653882,PMC5653882_4
