"A combined live h120 and cr88 vaccination programme at day-old followed by cr88 vaccination at day 14 provided excellent protection from virulent variant is/885 and is/1494 viruses, with 100% kidney protection and high ciliary and tracheal/kidney protection.",PMC4567785,PMC4567785_0
"The group with higher levels of humoral antibodies had better protection from both of the Middle East isolates, despite the low level of genetic identity in the s1 protein between the vaccine and challenge strains used in this study.",PMC4567785,PMC4567785_1
"The vaccination programme employed in this study showed higher mean elisa and hi titre at 30 days of age compared to the other vaccinated group, indicating an immunological boost.",PMC4567785,PMC4567785_2
"Despite the shared characteristics of the s1 protein of the vaccine and challenge ibvs, the protection achieved with the vaccination programme employed in this study was high, with a genetic relationship of the hypervariable region of the s1 gene between is/885 and h120 or cr88 of 80% and 79% respectively, and between is/1494 and h120 or cr88 of 81% and 80% respectively.",PMC4567785,PMC4567785_3
"The group with higher levels of humoral antibodies had better protection from both of the Middle East isolates, which reinforces the importance of optimizing local and cell-mediated mucosal immunity at the respiratory lining through strategic heterologous day-old vaccination for enhanced protection from variant viruses.",PMC4567785,PMC4567785_4
