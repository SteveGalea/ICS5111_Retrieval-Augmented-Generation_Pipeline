"The study identified a protein function in byrovirus replication that is separable from its proteolytic activity, indicating that l-pro has an additional role in rna amplification.",PMC110390,PMC110390_0
"The study revealed that the product of orf 8, p21, plays an important role in rna amplification and transcription, as a mutant lacking its start codon resulted in a fivefold reduction in rna accumulation.",PMC110390,PMC110390_1
"The study found that the putative rna helicase encoded in orfs 2 to 8 is dispensable for rna accumulation at the single-cell level, as a mutant lacking the 3'-terminal part of the genome resulted in reduced amplification efficiency.",PMC110390,PMC110390_2
"The study determined that the cleavage between l-pro and the remainder of the orf 1a product is essential for genome amplification, as a mutant with a deletion removing the cleavage site was replication incompetent.",PMC110390,PMC110390_3
"The study showed that the leader proteinase domain of l-pro is conserved among closteroviruses, as the remaining about three-fourths of the variable n-terminal domain did not exhibit any conserved sequence motifs that could be targeted for mutagenesis.",PMC110390,PMC110390_4
