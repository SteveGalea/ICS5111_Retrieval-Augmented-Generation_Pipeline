"The authors developed a microwave applicator for enzymatic reactions and demonstrated the effect of microwave heating on rolling circle amplification (RCA) of DNA. They found that the RCA reaction rate and product yield were accelerated at higher temperatures, and the maximum incubation time could be shortened.",PMC4562646,PMC4562646_0
"The authors reported that the ionic components of the thermopol buffer, which contains a high concentration of ions, are selectively heated by microwave heating, and the rate of temperature increase induced by microwave heating depends on the components of a molecule and the concentrations of buffer components.",PMC4562646,PMC4562646_1
"The authors found that the complex dielectric constant of protein in water or buffer solution has been described, and they measured the complex dielectric constant of RCA components from 13°C to 60°C.",PMC4562646,PMC4562646_2
The authors compared the effect of ph alteration on RCA products using the thermopol buffer prepared by them with a control RCA using a commercial RCA kit (NEB). They confirmed that no effect of RCA products by ph alteration of this range was observed by electrophoresis and fluorescence analysis.,PMC4562646,PMC4562646_3
"The authors found that the component of Bst DNA polymerase-LF, which contains a high concentration of ions, is selectively heated by microwave heating, and the rate of temperature increase induced by microwave heating depends on the components of a molecule and the concentrations of buffer components.",PMC4562646,PMC4562646_4
