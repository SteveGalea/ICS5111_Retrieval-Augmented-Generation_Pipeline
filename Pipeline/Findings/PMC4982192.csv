"The development of vaccines and antibody technologies for MERS-CoV requires a better understanding of the virus's epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenesis in humans and animals. This information will inform the design of target product profiles for human and veterinary vaccines, guide vaccine testing, and facilitate licensure and access.",PMC4982192,PMC4982192_0
"Animal models currently being used to evaluate MERS-CoV infection do not fully reflect the pathogenesis of severe human disease. A combination of both small and large animal models should be considered for vaccine evaluation, and standardization is needed to ensure reproducibility and facilitate licensure and access.",PMC4982192,PMC4982192_1
Therapeutic antibodies have the potential to be useful tools in MERS prevention and treatment. Concerns around potential disease enhancement mutants with increased fitness warrant continued investigation and surveillance.,PMC4982192,PMC4982192_2
"Greater coordination around specific technology platform collaborations is needed to accelerate research and development. Key components of a partnership should include coordinating funding, sharing samples and data, and standardizing assays and reagents for testing.",PMC4982192,PMC4982192_3
"The Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health (Moh) recognizes the crucial role it has to play in defining the public health goals that will guide MERS-CoV vaccine development efforts. Accelerating the development of a vaccine requires a better understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenesis in humans and animals, as well as a clear expectation of how the vaccine will fit into the larger public health strategy to combat MERS.",PMC4982192,PMC4982192_4
