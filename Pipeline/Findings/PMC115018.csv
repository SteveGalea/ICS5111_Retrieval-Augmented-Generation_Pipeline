"The study generated a deletion mutant of the 6k protein in the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) called sv del6k, which showed an intermediate-plaque-size phenotype and impaired processing of viral glycoproteins due to deficient functioning of the deleted 6k.",PMC115018,PMC115018_0
"Revertant SFV carrying a mutation in the 6k protein (sv del6k-revq21l) partially restored the processing of viral glycoproteins, but still displayed an intermediate-plaque-size phenotype and showed impaired release of virions from cells.",PMC115018,PMC115018_1
"The study found that the SFV 6k protein promoted membrane permeabilization and lateral interactions between glycoprotein heterodimers during budding, but its coexpression in trans did not complement the SFV del6k or SFV del6k-revq21l phenotypes.",PMC115018,PMC115018_2
"Comparative studies of viroporins, which are proteins with physical and biological similarities to the SFV 6k protein, will indicate to what extent they share analogous functions during the replicative cycle of animal viruses.",PMC115018,PMC115018_3
