"The study utilized a novel diagnostic platform, called the GIS PathChip, which combines microfluidics, DNA nanoballoon technology, and a silicon nanopore array to simultaneously identify and enumerate multiple respiratory viruses in clinical samples.",PMC3592061,PMC3592061_0
"The GIS PathChip was able to detect a wide range of viruses, including human bocavirus, human parechovirus, rotavirus, influenza C virus, and poliovirus, which were not identified by the traditional methods of culture, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.",PMC3592061,PMC3592061_1
"The GIS PathChip was also able to accurately classify enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, which is typically beyond the scope of traditional specific primer polymerase chain reaction assays.",PMC3592061,PMC3592061_2
"The study found that the GIS PathChip detected coinfecting viruses in almost 30% of the samples, highlighting the complex nature of respiratory viral infections.",PMC3592061,PMC3592061_3
"The study suggests that the use of this technology for the detection and identification of viruses in the respiratory tract is now a viable option, as it offers high sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of commercially available and FDA-licensed respiratory pathogen panels.",PMC3592061,PMC3592061_4
