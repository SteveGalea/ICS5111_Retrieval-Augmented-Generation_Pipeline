The study used next generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA gene PCR amplicons to identify bacteria in post-mortem lung and lymph node tissue samples from fatal bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cases and clinically healthy animals.,PMC5414144,PMC5414144_0
"Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma, Pasteurellaceae, and Fusobacterium were the most abundant bacteria identified in the lungs and lymph nodes of BRD cases and healthy calves.",PMC5414144,PMC5414144_1
"Leptotrichiaceae, Fusobacterium, Mycoplasma, Trueperella, and Bacteroides had greater relative abundances in post-mortem lung samples from fatal BRD cases compared to samples from healthy calves without lung lesions.",PMC5414144,PMC5414144_2
"Leptotrichiaceae, Mycoplasma, and Pasteurellaceae showed higher relative abundances in post-mortem lymph node samples from fatal BRD cases compared to samples from healthy calves without lung lesions.",PMC5414144,PMC5414144_3
"Two Leptotrichiaceae sequence contigs were assembled from bacterial DNA-enriched shotgun sequences, suggesting the identification of a novel bacterial species associated with BRD.",PMC5414144,PMC5414144_4
