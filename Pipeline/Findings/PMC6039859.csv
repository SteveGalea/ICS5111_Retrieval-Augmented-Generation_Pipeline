"The structure of a network plays a more significant role than epidemiological parameters, such as pathogen transmission rates and immunizing effects, in determining epidemic outbreak magnitude.",PMC6039859,PMC6039859_0
"Network connectivity, clustering, and uniqueness (r) are the most important factors influencing epidemic outbreak magnitude, with r being positively associated with outbreak magnitude.",PMC6039859,PMC6039859_1
"The dynamics and outcome of an epidemic event are affected by network structure in complicated ways that cannot be captured by individual basic network properties, and that offer a way to prioritize preparedness efforts by focusing preventive and surveillance actions on the most vulnerable networks.",PMC6039859,PMC6039859_2
"The structure of a network is a main determinant of epidemic patterns, with complex features of the airline network being at heart of the global spread dynamics of diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome.",PMC6039859,PMC6039859_3
"Measuring the distance between the source and the target of an infection in network space can provide a more reliable prediction of epidemic spread rate than geographical distance, regardless of the nature of the disease.",PMC6039859,PMC6039859_4
