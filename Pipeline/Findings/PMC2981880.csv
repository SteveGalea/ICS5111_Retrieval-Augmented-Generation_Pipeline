"A new approach to vaccine discovery is needed due to the limited number of known vaccine antigens and the complexity of the factors mediating protein immunogenicity, including host-side properties, pathogen-side properties, protein expression levels, sub-cellular location, aggregation state, and the possession of post-translational danger signals.",PMC2981880,PMC2981880_0
"A concerted and far-reaching effort is necessary to address this issue, starting with the identification and prioritization of potential vaccine antigens using emerging antigen databases and then developing empirically-based, statistically-grounded approaches to predict the role of these factors in mediating protein immunogenicity.",PMC2981880,PMC2981880_1
"The program tasked with such a confounding task is called VaxiJen, which deconstructs the antigen presentation pathway, building models for each step and then integrating them into a fully functional model.",PMC2981880,PMC2981880_2
"Vaccines are a good thing, but we need to find new ways of making them, such as using peptide vaccines or vaccines based on APCs, which are important new directions for research in vaccine discovery.",PMC2981880,PMC2981880_3
"Many of the pathogens responsible for current recalcitrant and emergent diseases are much more complicated functionally and structurally, and cellular location, and their immunogenicity arises from many factors, including host-side properties, pathogen-side properties, protein expression levels, sub-cellular location, aggregation state, and the possession of post-translational danger signals.",PMC2981880,PMC2981880_4
"The reason for the failure to predict protein immunogenicity is comparatively simple: we cannot hope to capture what is necessary for prediction by looking at a single contributory factor, since protein immunogenicity arises from many factors.",PMC2981880,PMC2981880_5
"Factors mediating protein immunogenicity include host-side properties, such as the possession of b-cell epitopes or t-cell epitopes, pathogen-side properties, protein expression levels, sub-cellular location, aggregation state, and the possession of post-translational danger signals.",PMC2981880,PMC2981880_6
"Predicting such diverse properties remains challenging, but several contributing factors can be reliably predicted, such as the prediction of subcellular location, the prediction of protein expression levels, and the prediction of protein aggregation state.",PMC2981880,PMC2981880_7
