"Of the participants who reported contact with sick or injured bats, 18% reported ignoring a minor or major scratch, indicating a considerable potential risk for preventable Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) exposures.",PMC3908316,PMC3908316_1
"The study highlights the need for improved encephalitis surveillance and the use of a standardised encephalitis testing algorithm, which includes ABLV, to address the issue of unrecognised or unidentified aetiologies.",PMC3908316,PMC3908316_2
"The study suggests that risk communication has not adequately penetrated general community awareness, and future communication efforts need to adequately emphasise threat severity, the necessity of avoidance, and promote the alternative of contacting trained bat handlers to manage trapped or injured bats and flying foxes.",PMC3908316,PMC3908316_3
"The success of current messages advising against handling bats appears limited, particularly given the recent death in a Queensland child, indicating a considerable potential risk for preventable ABLV exposures.",PMC3908316,PMC3908316_4
