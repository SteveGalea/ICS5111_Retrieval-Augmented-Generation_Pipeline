The study presents a host cell-based assay system for general detection of enveloped viruses based on lipid raft-mediated uptake of the reporter gene by the virus.,PMC2916077,PMC2916077_0
The natural gpi-anchor of placental alkaline phosphatase can be incorporated effectively into the membrane of diverse enveloped virus particles.,PMC2916077,PMC2916077_1
"The system described allows the detection of multiple enveloped viruses, as it is based on expression of the reporter in trans, thus enabling the detection of multiple viruses.",PMC2916077,PMC2916077_2
"The study offers several advantages, including the ability to detect and subsequently analyze enveloped viruses without prior reference to their composition, and the fact that it allows the detection of multiple enveloped viruses that bud from the plasma membrane.",PMC2916077,PMC2916077_3
"One limitation of this system is cell culture adaptation as a pre-requisite for virus screening, as vero cells have proven as suitable host for multiple cell culture adapted viruses, but may not be suitable for all enveloped viruses, and in such cases, the use of alternate hosts such as mrc5 or mdck cells can be explored.",PMC2916077,PMC2916077_4
