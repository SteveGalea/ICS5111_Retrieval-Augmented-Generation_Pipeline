"In the context of liver transplantation, hepatitis C (HCV) is a complex problem for transplant recipients. While initial HCV-infected patients were not considered appropriate candidates for transplantation due to increased risk of mortality following transplantation, more recent studies have suggested that HCV-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have improved survival compared to historical controls. However, HCV-infected patients still experience increased morbidity from other chronic conditions, such as end-stage renal disease.",PMC3152274,PMC3152274_0
"In the context of respiratory viral infections, prevention involves avoidance of other infected individuals, hand hygiene, and use of droplet precautions for those suspected of having infection. Treatment for respiratory viral infections involves supportive care and, in some cases, the use of antiviral medications. Seasonal screening should be considered for donors before transplant by serologic and/or nucleic acid testing.",PMC3152274,PMC3152274_1
"In the context of renal transplantation, respiratory viral infections in transplant recipients continue to have significant impact on patient outcomes. Reports have demonstrated that West Nile virus (WNV), a flavivirus that causes a febrile illness and can be fatal, is transmissible through organ transplantation. Recipients who acquire WNV from their donors have increased morbidity and mortality, and the impact of newer immunosuppressive strategies continues to promote the development of severe viral infections.",PMC3152274,PMC3152274_2
"In the context of hepatitis B (HBV) in the renal transplant population, recognition of HBV in patients with chronic renal failure may be confounded by the limited sensitivity of serologic diagnosis in this population. While initial HBV-infected individuals were not considered appropriate candidates for transplantation, more recent studies have not demonstrated significant rejection, and patients did not experience significant infection-related morbidity following transplantation. However, HBV-infected patients still require careful management of immunosuppression along with supportive care.",PMC3152274,PMC3152274_3
"In the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in renal transplant recipients, HIV-infected patients receiving renal transplants may be at higher risk of acute rejection",PMC3152274,PMC3152274_4
