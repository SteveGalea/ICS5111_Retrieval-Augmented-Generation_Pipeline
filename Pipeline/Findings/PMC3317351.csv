"Viruses, such as adenovirus and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), use caspase cleavage as a mechanism to combat apoptosis. In some cases, such as in HSV-1 variants, caspase cleavage leads to viral attenuation by generating new viral products acting as dominant negatives of non-structural proteins (NS1) or unfit for virus packaging when structural proteins are concerned. Conversely, in other viruses, such as adenovirus and human papillomavirus (HPV), caspase cleavage allows the removal of specific regions that reveal or eliminate functional domains or signals. In some instances, such as in AMV D120 mutant, caspase cleavage leads to full viral amplification, as seen in NS1 protein of AMV.",PMC3317351,PMC3317351_0
"The functional consequences of some viral protein caspase cleavages still remain debated or elusive due to the difficulty of investigating hazardous entities, such as influenza and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the multitude of strains and genotypes, or the lack of appropriate tools, such as cellular or animal models allowing to recapitulate the viral life cycle, such as in TGEV and MCV.",PMC3317351,PMC3317351_1
"Viral protein caspase cleavage probably allows the removal of specific regions that reveal or eliminate functional domains or signals. For example, in MCV, caspase cleavage leads to the generation of an additional product (MR35,000) acting as a dominant negative of NS proteins or unfit for virus packaging when structural proteins are concerned (MCV capsid protein).",PMC3317351,PMC3317351_2
"Viruses use caspase cleavage as a strong strategy to handle apoptosis due to its direct combat against apoptosis, as seen in ACMNPV and WSSV. Viruses, such as HSV-1 and HPV, express proteins acting as strong and broad inhibitor caspase substrates.",PMC3317351,PMC3317351_3
"Viruses prove their fascinating adaptability by managing to use the molecular effectors of apoptosis to protect themselves from eradication without any additional genetic information required. Caspase-related products, such as structural or non-structural proteins, are mostly stable and suggest they are",PMC3317351,PMC3317351_4
