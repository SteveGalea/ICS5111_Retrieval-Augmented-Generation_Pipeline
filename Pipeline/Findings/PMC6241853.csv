Pneumococcal load is significantly higher in the laiv group compared to the control group (Figure 1).,PMC6241853,PMC6241853_0
"Concentrations of the cytokine CXCL10 are increased in the laiv group after virus infection, compared to the control group (Figure 2).",PMC6241853,PMC6241853_1
"Granulocyte numbers, predominantly neutrophils, are significantly higher in the laiv carriage+ group compared to the control carriage+ group and the laiv carriage- group at baseline and over time (Figure 3).",PMC6241853,PMC6241853_2
"Monocyte numbers are significantly higher in the laiv carriage+ group compared to the control carriage+ group at day 29, and this increase is associated with a higher concentration of CCL2 (Figure 5).",PMC6241853,PMC6241853_3
"The nasal cell responses to in vitro stimulation with pneumococcus show significantly higher production of cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF, in the laiv group compared to the control group, particularly in those who had very low carriage loads (Figure 6).",PMC6241853,PMC6241853_4
"(Bonnin et al., 2018) Carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal) in the absence of influenza infection leads to quick degranulation of nasal neutrophils followed by recruitment of monocytes to the nose, which is associated with the start of clearance. In contrast, influenza infection leads to inflammation, which impairs this innate control of carriage (Figure 7).",PMC6241853,PMC6241853_5
