"The study identified a new influenza virus strain, H1N1sw, in a French summer camp in 2009, which co-circulated with the pandemic H1N1 strain and showed a lower attack rate in children under 15 years old compared to the pandemic strain.",PMC2822845,PMC2822845_0
"The study found that the prevalence of antibodies to H1N1sw was low under 30 years of age, suggesting previous exposure to influenza virus(es) antigenically related to the current H1N1sw strain, possibly before 1970 and potentially between the first and the second world war.",PMC2822845,PMC2822845_1
The study found that the attack rate of infection among teenagers was 3 times the risk of the youngest (under 8 years old) and that the shedding of higher titres of virus by children was the major parameter associated with high attack rates.,PMC2822845,PMC2822845_2
"The study revealed that the mechanism of emergence of I106-D248 strains, which are currently dominant, remains unclear and may have emerged from a common ancestor or through convergent evolution towards id strains originating from various VN ancestors.",PMC2822845,PMC2822845_3
"The study found that the prevalence of antibodies to H1N1sw was similar in young adults supervising children and in children under 15 years old, but the attack rate observed in children (median age 11) was similar to that observed in young adults supervising them (median age 22).",PMC2822845,PMC2822845_4
