Four povidone iodine (PVP-I) formulations were tested against Ebola virus (EBV) using a large-volume plating method due to its increased sensitivity.,PMC4574578,PMC4574578_0
"All PVP-I formulations showed excellent virucidal efficacy against EBV, reducing viral titres by >99.99% to >99.999% under clean and dirty conditions after 15 seconds.",PMC4574578,PMC4574578_1
Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was used as a surrogate for EBV due to its similarity as an enveloped virus.,PMC4574578,PMC4574578_2
"The concentration-contact time values obtained with MVA were used to verify the EBV results, confirming the excellent virucidal efficacy of PVP-I against enveloped viruses.",PMC4574578,PMC4574578_3
The study highlights the important role PVP-I can play in preventing and limiting the spread of EBV.,PMC4574578,PMC4574578_4
