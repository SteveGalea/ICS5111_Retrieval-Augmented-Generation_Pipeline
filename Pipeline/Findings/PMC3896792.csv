"A two-step sybr green I-based real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the n gene of PPRV was developed and evaluated in clinical samples. The assay was highly sensitive, specific, reproducible, and rapid for detection and quantification of PPRV nucleic acids.",PMC3896792,PMC3896792_0
"The assay generated a standard curve that was applicable for accurate quantification of PPRV, with a linearity range of seven orders of magnitude. Compared to a previously published real-time TaqMan RT-PCR assay for the same gene target of PPRV, the present assay was more sensitive, which may be due to the use of sybr green I chemistry.",PMC3896792,PMC3896792_1
"The assay showed higher sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR in detecting PPRV nucleic acids directly from clinical samples. All the samples found positive by conventional RT-PCR were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, and additional positive samples were detected by the new assay.",PMC3896792,PMC3896792_2
"The assay developed in this study showed no measurable inhibition in spiked negative nasal swabs when compared to pure tissue culture virus, indicating that the PCR performance was the same in spiked clinical samples and tissue culture-propagated virus.",PMC3896792,PMC3896792_3
"The assay was validated on clinical samples, and the reported intra- and inter-assay variations with regard to Ct values were very small and comparable with previously reported TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assays for PPRV.",PMC3896792,PMC3896792_4
