"In the context of chronic disease, regulatory T cells (tregs) play a beneficial role in limiting collateral damage without delaying viral clearance. For example, in the case of neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection, tregs are critical in ameliorating clinical disease and demyelination, particularly during acute infection when maximum viral antigen is present. In contrast, in the case of MHV strain J2.2, which causes mild acute encephalitis and chronic demyelination, virus-specific tregs are present in the virus-infected central nervous system and, based on concurrent detection with virus-specific effector CD4+ T cells and identification within the naïve T cell precursor pools in the spleen and lymph nodes, are presumed to arise from the natural Treg pool. These virus-specific tregs express IL-10 and IFN-γ upon stimulation with viral peptide and suppress proliferation of cognate-epitope specific effector CD4+ T cells.",PMC3386620,PMC3386620_0
