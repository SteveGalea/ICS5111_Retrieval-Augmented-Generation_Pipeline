"A study by Robert Krug and colleagues identified that while the infection of cells at a high moi with various influenza A b viral strains upregulated free ISG15, no ISG15-conjugates were detected [11]. The mechanism for this inhibition was mediated by the NS1/B gene, which non-covalently bound to ISG15 and inhibited its ability to bind to and inhibit ISG15 conjugate formation [11].",PMC3185569,PMC3185569_0
"Another study by Krug and colleagues found that the e3 protein, which is known to antagonize the host IFN response by several mechanisms, was also shown to bind to ISG15 through its C-terminal domain and inhibit ISG15 conjugate formation [33].",PMC3185569,PMC3185569_1
"A recent study by Ying Zhang and colleagues identified a viral protein, vaccinia virus, that antagonizes ISG15. The E3 protein, which is known to antagonize the host IFN response by several mechanisms, was also found to bind to ISG15 through its C-terminal domain and globally deconjugate both ubiquitin and ISG15 from target proteins [56].",PMC3185569,PMC3185569_2
A study by Krug and colleagues found that expression of ISG15-conjugation by either overexpression studies or knockdown studies will need to be confirmed in vivo [24].,PMC3185569,PMC3185569_3
"A study by Durfee and colleagues suggests that only actively translated proteins will be targeted for ISG15 conjugation [24]. These would include the many genes that are induced by type I IFN, and will be expressed in cells that are not virally infected [24]. The impact of ISG15 conjugation on these proteins and what is their fate remains unanswered [24].",PMC3185569,PMC3185569_4
