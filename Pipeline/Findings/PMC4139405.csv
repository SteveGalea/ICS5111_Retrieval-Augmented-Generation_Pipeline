"MERS-COV is a novel beta coronavirus that causes severe respiratory illness, with a high case fatality rate. It was first identified in 2012 in a patient in Saudi Arabia, and has since spread to over 20 countries.",PMC4139405,PMC4139405_0
"The transmission of MERS-COV is less efficient than that of SARS-COV, but the mortality rate is higher, at around 35-50%.",PMC4139405,PMC4139405_1
"The clinical features of MERS-COV are similar to those of other severe viral pneumonias, such as SARS-COV and pandemic influenza, but MERS-COV is more likely to cause acute renal failure.",PMC4139405,PMC4139405_2
"MERS-COV is primarily spread through close contact with symptomatic individuals or patients, and infection control precautions, including the use of masks and hand hygiene, are important in reducing transmission.",PMC4139405,PMC4139405_3
"The prognosis for MERS-COV is guarded, with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to high mortality rates, particularly in those with comorbidities.",PMC4139405,PMC4139405_4
