"This present study demonstrates that, in a rat model of plantar incisional pain, mechanical and thermal postoperative hypersensitivity after administration of bup-sr at doses of 0.3 or 1.2 mg/kg are no different for at least 72 h compared to twice-daily dosing of buprenorphine hcl at 0.05 mg/kg bid.",PMC3966277,PMC3966277_0
"The study suggests that bup-sr at 0.3 or 1.2 mg/kg provides effective antinociception in the incisional pain model in rats for 48 to 72 h without noteworthy side effects, such as weight loss and sedation, which were observed in rats given a single dose of 4.5 mg/kg bup-sr.",PMC3966277,PMC3966277_1
"The study reveals that, in addition to bup-sr at 0.3 or 1.2 mg/kg, buprenorphine hcl at doses exceeding the maximal effective dose may have less analgesic efficacy.",PMC3966277,PMC3966277_2
"The study highlights that the development of new techniques to administer analgesics postoperatively to rodents, such as injectable bup-sr, produces a minimal handling stress and is a substantial refinement in analgesia because it provides a sustained-release form of buprenorphine that provides analgesia over a course of 72 h, which is a considerable refinement in postoperative care in veterinary medicine.",PMC3966277,PMC3966277_3
"The study indicates that bup-sr at 0.3 or 1.2 mg/kg provides effective antinociception in the incisional pain model in rats for 48 to 72 h without noteworthy side effects, and additional studies measuring plasma concentration levels related to behavioral antinociception and possible synergistic effects bup-sr are warranted.",PMC3966277,PMC3966277_4
