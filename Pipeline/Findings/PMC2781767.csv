"The methanolic extract of Androsace rivularis exhibited strong antiviral activity against both herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and influenza virus A (IC50 values < 6.25 μg/mL), making it a potential source of antiviral drugs.",PMC2781767,PMC2781767_0
"Bergenia ciliata, which contains phenolic compounds, showed moderate antiviral activity against HSV-1 (IC50 value of 18 μg/mL) and influenza virus A (IC50 value of 19 μg/mL).",PMC2781767,PMC2781767_1
"The methanolic extract of Cassia fastigiata displayed strong antiviral activity against HSV-1 (IC50 value of 19 μg/mL), indicating the potential for finding antiviral drugs in this plant.",PMC2781767,PMC2781767_2
"The methanolic extract of Vaccaria thapsus showed strong antiviral activity against influenza virus A (IC50 value not reported), but further fractionation and separation of extract(s) may reveal potent antiviral activity due to the presence of compounds in low concentrations.",PMC2781767,PMC2781767_3
"The extracts that exhibited only moderate and low antiviral activity, such as Cotoneaster integrifolius, Juniperus squamata, Oxytropis williamsii, Rhododendron anthopogon, and Rubus foliolosus, could also be potential sources of antiviral drugs due to the possibility of revealing potent antiviral activity through further fractionation and separation of extract(s).",PMC2781767,PMC2781767_4
