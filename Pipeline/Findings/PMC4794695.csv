"The study found that the divalent cation required for maximum protein a activity during fhv rna replication is magnesium, as both magnesium and manganese have been implicated in various stages of rna replication in fhv, but manganese can substitute for magnesium during replication initiation and/or dsrna synthesis.",PMC4794695,PMC4794695_0
"The study demonstrated that, while protein a remains enzymatically active, it is unable to initiate subsequent rounds of synthesis using the products detected in the presence of detergent.",PMC4794695,PMC4794695_1
"The study showed that spherules generated during fhv infection are dynamic structures that are likely to be more dynamic than previously thought, at least in fhv, as mitochondria isolated from infected cells no longer show any signs of invaginations and spherules reform following the reinitiation of rna replication.",PMC4794695,PMC4794695_2
"The study suggested that dsrna could play an important role in the maintenance of spherule structure and/or their formation, as swirls of density observed within the spherules represent dsrna and the fact that this density was observed in all the spherules that were imaged suggests that dsrna could play a role in the maintenance of their structure and/or their formation.",PMC4794695,PMC4794695_3
"The study provided an opportunity to visualize spherules by cryo-em in the absence of stains and fixatives, which was of particular interest since all the em studies completed to date have used fixed and sectioned samples, as it eliminates the need for fixation and staining and can achieve resolutions below 5 nm, which should permit more detailed insights into the supramolecular organization of fhv protein a in the membrane, provide clues regarding its orientation and oligomeric state, and identify the structure of viral dsrna inside the spherules.",PMC4794695,PMC4794695_4
