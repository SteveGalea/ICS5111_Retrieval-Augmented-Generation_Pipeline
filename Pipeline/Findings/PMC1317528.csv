"The study by Shen et al. (50) showed that during multiple passages of ibv in vero cells, there was an insertion of a nucleotide within the 3b orf, resulting in the production of a greatly truncated 3b protein. The mutant virus replicated as well as wild-type beaudette in vero cells, demonstrating that the 3b protein is not essential for replication.",PMC1317528,PMC1317528_0
"The study by Liu and Ingels (42) reported that when orfs 3a and 3b were removed, translation of orf 3c did not occur in ribv δ3ab. The expression of the e protein was from a newly created monocistronic gene at the 5′ end of the sg mrna. The mutant virus replicated to titers within 10 times those of wild-type virus, demonstrating that neither the gene 4 proteins nor the 3a or 3b protein is essential for replication in vitro.",PMC1317528,PMC1317528_1
"The study by Li et al. (55) reported that although plasmid studies have demonstrated that translation of e from orf 5b involves internal initiation of translation mediated by orf 5a, orf 5a is not required in recombinant mhv. Removal of mhv gene 4 and the 5a sequence resulted in a virus that replicated to titers within 10 times those of wild-type virus, demonstrating that neither the gene 4 proteins nor the 5a protein is essential for replication in vitro.",PMC1317528,PMC1317528_2
"The study by Shen et al. (53) showed that the mhv 5a orf is not required in recombinant mhv.
