The study demonstrates the application of recombinase polymerase amplification (rPA) for rapid and sensitive detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in sputum samples.,PMC4138011,PMC4138011_0
"Two assays targeting separate repetitive elements were examined, both demonstrating the ability to detect MTBC dna with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in less than 20 minutes.",PMC4138011,PMC4138011_1
Both assays had high sensitivity (100%) with isolates that were smear and culture positive.,PMC4138011,PMC4138011_2
The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were not presented as the composition of the MTBC screening panels used in this study were selected to demonstrate proof of concept and do not reflect the normal distribution of specimens received for routine screening of pulmonary MTBC infection.,PMC4138011,PMC4138011_3
"The study highlights the potential of rPA as a tool for point-of-care diagnostics, as the comparatively low isothermal incubation temperature combined with rapid time to result allows rPA to be used with a battery-powered device, making it amenable to health clinics in developing countries that do not have reliable electricity supply.",PMC4138011,PMC4138011_4
Further studies are required to adapt sample extraction methodology for use at the point of care.,PMC4138011,PMC4138011_5
"The study notes that whereas 0.5 ml inoculum was used for culture, the volume taken for DNA extraction was only 0.25 ml, with just 5 Î¼l being used for each rPA assay.",PMC4138011,PMC4138011_6
The study suggests that improved sample handling and DNA extraction may improve detection from complex sample matrices such as sputum.,PMC4138011,PMC4138011_7
"The study notes that to fulfil the full potential of rPA for point-of-care diagnostics, an integrated platform to perform sample preparation and run the assay must be developed.",PMC4138011,PMC4138011_8
"The study notes that the number of negative samples included in this study were insufficient to assess the clinical specificity and the number of culture-positive, smear-negative samples should be increased to better determine the clinical sensitivity.",PMC4138011,PMC4138011_9
