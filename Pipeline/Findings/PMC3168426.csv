"The study reports the development of a flexible, cost-effective, and simple diagnostic system for the detection of influenza A viruses with drug-resistant mutations.",PMC3168426,PMC3168426_0
"The system involves the production of standard templates through the formation of dimers from two synthetic oligonucleotides in the presence of dNTP and Taq DNA polymerase, followed by ligation of four specific probes targeting resistance mutations using ligase chain reaction (LCR).",PMC3168426,PMC3168426_1
"The study demonstrates the potential of using laboratory safe artificial templates for the production of large, double-stranded DNA fragments.",PMC3168426,PMC3168426_2
The LCR system was validated through multiple cycle ligation with specific probes targeting resistance mutations.,PMC3168426,PMC3168426_3
"The study highlights the potential of the system to revolutionize molecular diagnostics and the production of large, double-stranded DNA fragments, which could lead to wide-ranging applications in the field.",PMC3168426,PMC3168426_4
