Fmdv lpro is a novel viral deubiquitinating enzyme that shares conserved cysteine and histidine residues with human dubs.,PMC3126127,PMC3126127_0
"Fmdv lbpro possesses deubiquitination activity towards both k48- and k63-linked ubiquitin polymers and can act as a negative regulator of type I interferon induction by deubiquitinating rig-i, tbk1, and traf3/6.",PMC3126127,PMC3126127_1
"The inhibition of type I interferon induction by fmdv lbpro correlates with its deubiquitination activity, but not its classical proteolytic activity towards eif-4g and viral polyprotein.",PMC3126127,PMC3126127_2
"Fmdv lbpro is a multifunctional protein that blocks the host cell antiviral response through multiple distinct mechanisms: cleavage of the translation initiation factor eif-4g, inhibition of activation of nf-Îºb and irf-3/7 protein expression, and deubiquitination of rig-i, tbk1, traf6, and traf3.",PMC3126127,PMC3126127_3
The identification of fmdv lbpro as a viral deubiquitinating enzyme reveals the multilayered counteracting of the host defense by a picornaviral leader protein and opens new research avenues to develop effective new strategies that target lbpro for control of fmdv infections.,PMC3126127,PMC3126127_4
