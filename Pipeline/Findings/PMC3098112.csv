The study presents a novel approach to predict amyloidogenic sequences using a naive Bayes classification algorithm and a decision tree-based classification method.,PMC3098112,PMC3098112_0
"The study finds that mutations in cdr3 and cdr4 regions are highly predictive of amyloidogenic sequences, and that mutations in these regions are associated with increased sheet-forming propensity.",PMC3098112,PMC3098112_1
"The study identifies specific mutations that are highly predictive of amyloidogenic sequences, such as Tyr at position 103 in VH region and Val at position 112 in CDR3 region.",PMC3098112,PMC3098112_2
"The study highlights the importance of considering mutations in specific locations, such as cdr3 and cdr4 regions, in predicting amyloidogenic sequences.",PMC3098112,PMC3098112_3
"The study suggests that mutations in specific locations, such as cdr3 and cdr4 regions, are associated with increased sheet-forming propensity, which may contribute to amyloidogenic sequences.",PMC3098112,PMC3098112_4
