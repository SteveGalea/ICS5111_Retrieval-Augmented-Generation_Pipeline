"The pec capsid gene was expressed in baculovirus and self-assembly of capsid proteins into vlps was achieved, resulting in the production of rpec vlps in large quantities. These vlps were antigenically and morphologically similar to native pec cowden virus particles.",PMC87958,PMC87958_0
"The expression of the rpec capsid gene in baculovirus did not require the inclusion of an upstream sequence, as was the case for the slv Houston/90/us strain. Instead, a downstream sequence of 98 nucleotides was included at the 3â€² end of the capsid gene.",PMC87958,PMC87958_1
The yield of rpec vlps in the baculovirus expression system was similar to that for the rmXV vlps. This finding suggests that the rpec vlps may have diagnostic potential for the detection of pec infections in swine.,PMC87958,PMC87958_2
"The rpec capsid proteins were expressed in large quantities inside the sf9 cells, and the rpec capsids remained in high concentration in the cell lysates until pid 7. This finding supports the applicability of a fixed-cell elisa and vlp elisa for the detection of pec-specific antibodies in diagnostic serology. Both tests showed good agreement for detection of pec-specific antibodies in swine sera. However, a higher background was detected with field sow serum samples diluted less than 1:400, and efforts are being made to resolve this issue by adding uninfected sf9 cell extract preparations to the serum dilution buffer.",PMC87958,PMC87958_3
