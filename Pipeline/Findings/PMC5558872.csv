Pathogen-reduced platelet transfusions increase the risk of platelet refractoriness and the platelet transfusion requirement in thrombocytopenic individuals with haematological or oncological disorders.,PMC5558872,PMC5558872_0
"There is no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality, clinically significant or severe bleeding, or serious adverse events between pathogen-reduced platelets and standard platelets.",PMC5558872,PMC5558872_1
The quality of evidence for these findings is low to high according to Grade methodology.,PMC5558872,PMC5558872_2
"The review identified subgroup differences in multiple trials between the two pathogen-reduced platelet technologies (Intercept® and Mirasol®) for all-cause mortality and the interval between platelet transfusions, favouring Intercept®.",PMC5558872,PMC5558872_3
None of the studies reported quality of life or economic outcomes.,PMC5558872,PMC5558872_4
