The study found that the human adenovirus 52 (HAdV-52) binds to sialic acid-containing glycans on cell surfaces through a previously unrecognized mechanism that employs both direct and transient contacts.,PMC5939068,PMC5939068_0
"The study identified a conserved binding pocket for sialic acid-containing glycans in the HAdV-52 fiber knob, which is distinct from the binding pocket for car, another sialic acid-containing glycan recognized by HAdV-52.",PMC5939068,PMC5939068_1
"The study found that HAdV-52 preferentially binds to sialic acid-containing glycans with a higher degree of polymerization, such as polysia, which are frequently expressed on the cell surfaces of cancer cells and have been associated with poor clinical prognosis.",PMC5939068,PMC5939068_2
"The study found that the binding pocket for polysia in HAdV-52 employs both direct and transient contacts, including low-affinity direct contacts and transient electrostatic and polar interactions between residues surrounding the binding pocket and sialic acid residues that are distal to the nonreducing end of the polysia chain.",PMC5939068,PMC5939068_3
"The study suggests that the binding of HAdV-52 to polysia-expressing cancer cells could have potential for the development of oncolytic vectors, as the specificity for polysia can be increased further by mutating a lysine residue in the binding pocket to an arginine, which reduces liver tropism and increases binding to polysia-expressing cancer cells.",PMC5939068,PMC5939068_4
