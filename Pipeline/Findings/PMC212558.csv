"The study found an association between the HLA-B* 4601 allele and susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection, as evidenced by a significantly increased frequency of this allele in severely ill SARS patients compared to other groups, including SARS patients with less severe disease and healthy controls.",PMC212558,PMC212558_0
"The study also found that the HLA-B* 1301 allele, which is commonly found in Asian populations, was decreased in SARS patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a possible association between this allele and resistance to SARS infection.",PMC212558,PMC212558_1
"The study noted that the HLA-B* 4601 allele, which is more commonly found in Southern Han populations, was also more frequently found in SARS patients from Southern Asian populations, including those from Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Singapore, than in Northern Han populations or in populations from other regions, such as Europe or Africa.",PMC212558,PMC212558_2
"The study suggested that the presence or absence of the HLA-B* 4601 allele may have been an important factor in the outbreak of the SARS epidemic, as populations with less variation in their HLA-related immune repertoires, such as European or African populations, were found to have less of this allele.",PMC212558,PMC212558_3
"The study also noted that the HLA-B* 1301 allele, which is less frequently found in Southern Han populations, was not associated with susceptibility to SARS infection, but further studies with a larger case-control dataset would be needed to confirm this finding.",PMC212558,PMC212558_4
