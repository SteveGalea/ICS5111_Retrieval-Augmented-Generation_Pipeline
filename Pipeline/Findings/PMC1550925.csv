Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) significantly increased the diagnostic yield of respiratory viruses in children with severe lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) compared to conventional methods such as viral culture and direct immunofluorescence (DIF).,PMC1550925,PMC1550925_0
"Real-time PCR identified multiple viral infections (found in 35% of patients) that were not detected using conventional methods, highlighting the importance of real-time PCR in guiding initial patient cohorting strategies and therapy in the PICU.",PMC1550925,PMC1550925_1
"Real-time PCR allowed for the detection of respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, and NL63), and rhinoviruses, which are important causes of severe lrti and pneumonia in immunocompromised patients and elderly adults.",PMC1550925,PMC1550925_2
"The study found a high prevalence of possible or proven bacterial infections (74%) in PICU patients with lrti, highlighting the difficulty of precluding this diagnosis.",PMC1550925,PMC1550925_3
"The study did not demonstrate infections with atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae in children with severe lrti, suggesting that atypical pathogens may not play an important role in these patients.",PMC1550925,PMC1550925_4
