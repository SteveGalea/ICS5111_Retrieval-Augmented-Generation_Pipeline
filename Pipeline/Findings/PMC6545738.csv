Controllability analysis identifies key regulating host factors of the infected cell's progression during influenza A virus infection.,PMC6545738,PMC6545738_0
"Virus interacting and driver host proteins are significant both topologically and in controllability, playing important roles in cell behavior during infection.",PMC6545738,PMC6545738_1
Topological and controllability analyses provide evidence of wide-reaching network effects stemming from the addition of viral-host protein interactions.,PMC6545738,PMC6545738_2
"Functional analysis finds overlap with previous siRNA studies of host factors involved in influenza replication, nf-kb pathway, and infection relevance, and roles as interferon regulating genes.",PMC6545738,PMC6545738_3
"24 proteins are identified as holding regulatory roles specific to the infected cell by measures of topology, controllability, and functional role, recommended for further study as potential antiviral drug targets.",PMC6545738,PMC6545738_4
