"A study on 120 previously healthy children with severe lower respiratory tract infection identified three rare variants in the ifih1 gene, leading to disruption in its function, which is critical for viral RNA sensing. The loss of function was due to partial or complete loss of the helicase domain or the ctd domain.",PMC5547624,PMC5547624_0
"The study found that these variants interfere with the wild-type protein in terms of stability, atpase activity, and capacity to induce type 1 interferon production, suggesting a dominant negative effect, which provides a rationale for the unusual susceptibility to respiratory viruses observed in heterozygous individuals.",PMC5547624,PMC5547624_1
"The study found that some ifih1 alleles increase susceptibility to viral respiratory infections, but the same lof variants are known to be protective against type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases, strongly suggesting a role for balancing selection in their maintenance.",PMC5547624,PMC5547624_2
"The study found that rare gain-of-function mutations in ifih1 dramatically up-regulate type 1 interferon production, resulting in aicardi–Goutières syndrome or singleton–Merten syndrome.",PMC5547624,PMC5547624_3
"The study found that at the functional level, a missense ifih1 variant that is associated with multiple autoimmune diseases bolsters autoimmune responses against self-RNA, providing insight into the pivotal role of innate immune recognition and activation in the intricate balance between host defense, inflammation, and autoimmunity.",PMC5547624,PMC5547624_4
