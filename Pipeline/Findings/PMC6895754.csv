"This study found that all six common respiratory viruses, including civ, cpiv, cadv-2, cahv-1, crcov, and cvd, were detected in both cai and hai dogs, suggesting that these viruses are already circulating in both environments.",PMC6895754,PMC6895754_0
"Co-infections with civ and crcov, the most commonly detected viruses, were frequently found with themselves or other viruses in both study groups, indicating that these viruses may act either as primary or secondary agents in co-infections.",PMC6895754,PMC6895754_1
"The clinical severity of cirdc infection was related to the age of the affected dogs, with puppies having a more severe clinical level compared to dogs in other age groups.",PMC6895754,PMC6895754_2
"There was no significant difference in the types of cird-associated viruses between cai and hai groups, except for cvd, which was more associated with cai dogs.",PMC6895754,PMC6895754_3
"The high detection rate of civ, crcov, and cahv-1 suggests the need for further consideration of an appropriate vaccination regimen.",PMC6895754,PMC6895754_4
"Furthermore, the relationship between age and clinical severity highlights the importance of considering age as a factor in managing respiratory diseases in dogs.",PMC6895754,PMC6895754_5
