"In a study conducted in sub-Saharan Africa to understand the mechanisms of spread of respiratory infections, it was found that schools and households are hubs of transmission due to prolonged and more intimate contacts.",PMC6719676,PMC6719676_0
"Results from this study will include the number and duration of contacts and how they vary by age, gender, day of the week, role, and location, but are limited due to the spatially restricted data collection sites.",PMC6719676,PMC6719676_1
"This study will investigate contacts within schools and households, which are important settings for spread of respiratory infections, through random selection of students in a school and linking the students to their entire households and neighbors.",PMC6719676,PMC6719676_2
"The current sensors used in this study offer advantages compared to a pilot study conducted in the same setting due to their smaller and lighter size, ability to be worn by people of all ages including infants, bigger memory and battery capacity, and longer data collection periods.",PMC6719676,PMC6719676_3
"Data in de-identified format will be open access to support future use by the wider research community or replication, and access to identifiable data by people outside the investigators and specific collaborators will require permission from the senior investigators, the data governance committee in KEMRI-WTRP, and where necessary, national ethics committees.",PMC6719676,PMC6719676_4
