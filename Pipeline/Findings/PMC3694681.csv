"The authors propose a novel method, Multi-Task Pathway Logistic Regression (MTPL), to predict interactions between human proteins and proteins from bacterial species based on the commonality hypothesis, which suggests that the pathway memberships of human proteins from interactions should be similar across tasks.",PMC3694681,PMC3694681_0
"MTPL utilizes pathway information from databases like Reactome and PID to construct a pathway-based objective biology representation, where a human protein can be a member of multiple pathways based on the biological processes it is involved in. The authors define a pathway-summary function, s, which aggregates all pathway vectors for a given task to summarize the pathway memberships.",PMC3694681,PMC3694681_1
"The authors perform enrichment analysis on the human pathways from the positive predictions of MTPL and find that 17 pathways are commonly enriched across all four bacterial species, indicating that the regularizer produced by MTPL produces predictions satisfying the commonality hypothesis. They also find that 104 pathways are enriched across the three high-throughput datasets, which is a significant fraction of the total number of pathways considered.",PMC3694681,PMC3694681_2
The authors analyze the overlap between the pathways enriched in the gold-standard positives and those enriched in the predictions and provide details in the supplementary section.,PMC3694681,PMC3694681_3
"The authors use the cccp algorithm to optimize the objective function, which has a difference-of-convex functions form and uses the logistic loss terms, the pathway summary function, and the regularizer terms to achieve a non-convex objective function. They implement the cccp algorithm, which was originally introduced by Yuille and Rangarajan (2003), to optimize this function.",PMC3694681,PMC3694681_4
