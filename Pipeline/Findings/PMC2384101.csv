"A parasitic protein, rov-asp-1, derived from the human hookworm, O. Volvulus, has immunostimulatory properties for human ifn-γ cellular recall responses to tetanus (TT) and hepatitis C (HCV) antigens in vitro.",PMC2384101,PMC2384101_0
The protein has possible applications for the direct stimulation of natural killer (NK) cells against viral pathogens and tumors.,PMC2384101,PMC2384101_1
"The protein enhances antigen-specific ifn-γ responses in patients with chronic HCV infection, where such responses tend to decline with years of infection.",PMC2384101,PMC2384101_2
Contact between CD56+ and CD56- cells is required for the immunostimulatory effect of rov-asp-1 on antigen-specific responses in vitro.,PMC2384101,PMC2384101_3
"The protein requires cell-cell contact between CD56+ and other cells for its immunostimulatory effect on antigen-specific responses in vitro, and CD56+ cells from both chronic HCV (c-HCV) and non-HCV (nHCV) subjects respond to rov-asp-1 and are equally amenable to its immunostimulatory effect on antigen-specific responses in vitro.",PMC2384101,PMC2384101_4
