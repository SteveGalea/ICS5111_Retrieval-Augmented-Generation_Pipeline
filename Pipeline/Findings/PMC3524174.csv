"The authors generated rvvs by inserting full-length cdnas encoding either the hcv structural protein, nonstructural protein, or all hcv proteins into a separate pbmsf7c vector downstream of the pbmsf7c ati/p7.5 hybrid promoter in the hemagglutinin gene region of the vaccinia virus, which was reconstructed from the psfj1-10 plasmid and pbm vector. The final designations of these recombinant viruses were pbmsf7c-cn2, pbmsf7c-n25, or pbmsf-cn5.",PMC3524174,PMC3524174_0
"The authors confirmed the expression of each protein from the recombinant viruses by western blot analysis and determined the titers of rvv-cn2, rvv-n25, and rvv-cn5 by a standard plaque assay using rk13 cells.",PMC3524174,PMC3524174_1
The authors observed lipid degeneration in liver samples taken from rzcn5-15(+/−)/mxcre(+/−) mice and found that the immune response following poly(i:c) injection in the acute phase was reduced by treatment with rvv-n25 in these mice.,PMC3524174,PMC3524174_2
"The authors noted that the daily cytokine profiles of the serum from cn2-29(+/−)/mxcre(+/−) mice during the week following inoculation with lc16m8, rvv-cn2, rvv-n25, or rvv-cn5 were similar to those in the acute phase of hcv infection, but that the elevated levels of cytokines were completely blocked by intravenous injection of tnf-α and il-6 neutralizing antibodies.",PMC3524174,PMC3524174_3
"The authors reported that the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in male and female transgenic mice at 360, 480, and 600 days after poly(i:c) injection was lower in mice carrying the rzcn5-15(+/−)/mxcre(+/−) transgene than in mice carrying the cn2-29(+/−)/mxcre(+/−) transgene.",PMC3524174,PMC3524174_4
