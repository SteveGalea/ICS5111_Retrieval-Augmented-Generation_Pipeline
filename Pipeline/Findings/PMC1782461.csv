"The study identified three cpg-oligonucleotides (d19, d32, and 2216) that induce high levels of interferon-α (IFN-α) production by porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which is exclusively produced by natural interferon producer cells (nipcs).",PMC1782461,PMC1782461_0
"The study demonstrated that IFN-α is produced by the porcine equivalent of nipcs and that only the swc3low CD4+ cell population, representing porcine nipcs, expresses IFN-α and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) following cpg-oligonucleotide (cpg-ODN) stimulation.",PMC1782461,PMC1782461_1
"The study showed that the gacgtt motif, present in cpg-ODN 2135, promotes antibody responses when used as an adjuvant in pigs, but this cpg-ODN was unable to induce IFN-α production, indicating that the adjuvant effect was mediated by targeting another population of leucocytes.",PMC1782461,PMC1782461_2
"The study found that the cpg-ODN 1585, which induces lymphocyte proliferation in several species, including pigs, did not activate porcine PBMCs to produce IFN-α, indicating that the induction of proliferation is IFN-α independent.",PMC1782461,PMC1782461_3
"The study demonstrated that cpg-ODNs, with poly G sequences at both the 5′ and 3′ ends and central CG dinucleotides, target porcine nipcs, but not other myeloid DC or monocyte cell populations.",PMC1782461,PMC1782461_4
