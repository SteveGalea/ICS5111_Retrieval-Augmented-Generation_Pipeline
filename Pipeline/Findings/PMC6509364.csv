"The study found that correctional institutions had the highest diagnosis rate and or of latent tuberculosis (LTBI) among contacts, but a lower treatment completion rate compared to schools. This highlights the need to establish a system for post-discharge control and continuous treatment for LTBI patients in correctional institutions, as well as in social welfare facilities and workplaces, particularly for individuals aged 35 years or older.",PMC6509364,PMC6509364_0
"The study identified that, unlike active tuberculosis (TB) patients, patients with LTBI have not been included in the target population for directly observed treatment (DOT) or tuberculosis (TB) public-private mix model (PPM) recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). This suggests the need to extend DOT to include patients with LTBI to improve the completion rate of LTBI treatment.",PMC6509364,PMC6509364_1
"The study found that the general workplace had lower treatment initiation and completion rates of LTBI, which could be attributed to the unclear guidelines for the management of infected individuals in the workplace congregated settings. This highlights the need for a system to monitor and manage the treatment process in patients with LTBI aged 35 years or older in workplaces.",PMC6509364,PMC6509364_2
"The study found that, unlike the case of active TB patients, the completion rate of LTBI treatment was lower in individuals aged 35 years or older, and efforts should be made to enhance the early detection of the first patients with TB in this population.",PMC6509364,PMC6509364_3
"The study found that, unlike the case of active TB patients, patients with LTBI have not been included in the target population for information transfer about LTBI patients to the corresponding community health centers after discharge from congregated settings, which could lead to a lower treatment completion rate in patients with LTBI. This highlights the need to establish a system to transfer information about LTBI patients to the corresponding community health centers after discharge from congregated settings to raise the treatment completion rate in patients with LTBI.",PMC6509364,PMC6509364_4
