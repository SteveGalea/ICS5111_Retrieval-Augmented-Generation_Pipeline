The study found that the optimal temperature for culturing the produced lymphoblastoids was 37-37.5Â°C.,PMC5539668,PMC5539668_1
The study determined that rpmi was the best medium for culturing the lymphoblastoids.,PMC5539668,PMC5539668_2
The study found that 5% CO2 was the finest percentage for culturing the lymphoblastoids.,PMC5539668,PMC5539668_3
The study identified that a fbs concentration of 20% was the most appropriate for culturing the lymphoblastoids.,PMC5539668,PMC5539668_4
