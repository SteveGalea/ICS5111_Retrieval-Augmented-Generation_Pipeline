"The incidence of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases increased yearly in a university hospital in Taiwan from 1997 to 2002, with mac being the most common pathogen causing pulmonary disease, followed by rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGMs).",PMC2870472,PMC2870472_0
"The disease spectrum due to NTM varied by geographical regions and with time. In addition to mac, RGMs also played important roles in pulmonary disease in Taiwan, while m. Kansaii was the second most common NTM causing pulmonary disease in some parts of Europe and South Africa, and M. Xenopi was rarely encountered as a pathogen causing pulmonary disease before 1997.",PMC2870472,PMC2870472_1
"RGMs were the most important pathogens causing extrapulmonary diseases, particularly skin/soft-tissue infection and osteomyelitis and keratitis. M. Marinum and M. Kansaii were important pathogens associated with skin/soft-tissue infection and osteomyelitis.",PMC2870472,PMC2870472_2
"The majority of patients with disseminated disease had acquired HIV infection (75%), while diabetes mellitus was frequently associated with skin/soft-tissue infection but not with disseminated disease or pulmonary disease.",PMC2870472,PMC2870472_3
"NTM pleurisy was characterized by low virulence and indolence, with only a few patients receiving medical treatment, and the mortality was related to underlying conditions. Peritonitis caused by NTM was uncommon in this study, and only four patients (7%) with NTM-positive culture in ascites received medical treatment.",PMC2870472,PMC2870472_4
