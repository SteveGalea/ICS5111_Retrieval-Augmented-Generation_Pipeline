"Researchers successfully established a pseudovirus packaging system using lentiviral vectors and a recombinant expression plasmid encoding rift valley fever virus (RVFV) structural proteins, which exhibited similar patterns of cell infection to natural RVFV and could be used to replace the natural virus in virus neutralization assays.",PMC5879068,PMC5879068_0
"Electron microscopy observations and Western blotting results indicated successful construction of RVFV pseudoviruses, and antibody inhibition assays showed that the infective activity of the obtained RVFV pseudoviruses could be inhibited by specific antibodies.",PMC5879068,PMC5879068_1
The RVFV pseudovirus neutralization assay established in this study could be used to detect RVFV-neutralizing antibody titers and effectively evaluated antibody titers in positive mouse serum.,PMC5879068,PMC5879068_2
"The packaging efficiency and infection titers of the RVFV pseudoviruses were affected by the passage time and status of the 293T cells and transfection reagents, plasmid purity, gene features of the structural proteins, and efficiency of the eukaryotic expression plasmids.",PMC5879068,PMC5879068_3
"The RVFV pseudovirus could be used to replace the natural virus in infection mechanism studies, but the packaging conditions should be optimized to increase the lentiviral packaging efficiency and infection titers.",PMC5879068,PMC5879068_4
