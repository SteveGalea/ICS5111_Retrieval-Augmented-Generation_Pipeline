"A novel hadv-7 serotype 7 variant with enhanced virulence and the ability to cross-species transmission was identified through whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 10 representative hadv-7 isolates, including one from a non-recruit ard case in Xiangyang city, 4 from Base A (Xiangyang) outbreak cases, and 5 from Base B (Jingmen) outbreak cases.",PMC4559894,PMC4559894_0
"The outbreak-associated representative strain XY1, isolated from the index case A from Base A, was found to seemingly have higher viral replication than the hadv-7 strain CD228, recovered from a non-outbreak associated case, through viral growth kinetics analysis.",PMC4559894,PMC4559894_1
A 12-bp deletion in the va RNA gene and a point mutation in the dna polymerase gene were verified through screening of an additional 46 hadv-7 outbreak strains by PCR and DNA sequencing with primers listed in Table S1.,PMC4559894,PMC4559894_2
Comparative genomic analysis was performed to find nucleotide acid changes and amino acid substitutions between the outbreak strains and the local or other hadv-7 strains circulating in China.,PMC4559894,PMC4559894_3
"A severe case, defined as a patient admitted to an ICU for serious complications such as pneumonia, heart, and liver failure, shock, and sepsis, was identified through field investigations of the outbreak period, during which 796 nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from both Base A (Xiangyang city) and Base B (Jingmen city) outbreak patients, close contacts without ARD symptoms, and non-recruit patients diagnosed with ARD in other hospitals in the local.",PMC4559894,PMC4559894_4
