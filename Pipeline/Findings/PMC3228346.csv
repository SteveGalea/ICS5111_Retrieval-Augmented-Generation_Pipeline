"The majority of zoonotic pathogens infect and are amplified by multiple reservoir species, despite the tendency to focus on a single ""primary"" reservoir species.",PMC3228346,PMC3228346_0
"Reservoir species are qualitatively high-quality patches that make a positive contribution to the overall abundance of the zoonotic pathogen. However, each reservoir species has a quantitatively different impact on pathogen abundance and human disease risk.",PMC3228346,PMC3228346_1
"Dilution species negatively impact the abundance of pathogens and can decrease human disease risk. This can occur by reducing rates of encounter between pathogens and reservoir species, regulating the abundance of reservoir species, or regulating the abundance of vectors.",PMC3228346,PMC3228346_2
"Vector-borne diseases comprise some of the most virulent human diseases, and transmission can be enhanced by debilitating symptoms as immobilized hosts are poorer at avoiding mosquito bites than are asymptomatic hosts, resulting in longer feeding bouts that increase the probability of acquiring blood-borne pathogens.",PMC3228346,PMC3228346_3
"Species that play no direct role in increasing or diluting pathogen abundance can affect pathogen abundance by regulating the density, distribution, and timing of resources for reservoir hosts.",PMC3228346,PMC3228346_4
