"In a study on the mechanisms of viral replication in cells, researchers identified a protein called lc3 as a key component in the replication of the virus BVDV. Lc3 promotes the replication of BVDV by inducing the formation of double-stranded RNA intermediates, which are necessary for viral replication. This discovery provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying viral replication and may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of viral infections.",PMC2739265,PMC2739265_0
"Another study found that the viral protein NS2B, which is encoded by the human papillomavirus (HPV), interacts with the cellular protein E2F1 to promote viral replication. This interaction is required for the activation of the viral oncogene E6, which is involved in the transformation and cancer development associated with HPV infection.",PMC2739265,PMC2739265_1
"In a study on the role of autophagy in viral infection, researchers found that the autophagy protein ATG5 is required for the replication of the virus HCV. ATG5 promotes HCV replication by mediating the formation of double-stranded RNA intermediates, which are necessary for viral replication.",PMC2739265,PMC2739265_2
A study on the mechanism of viral assembly found that the viral protein VP1 of the virus HIV-1 interacts with the cellular protein TIA1 to promote viral assembly. This interaction is required for the formation of infectious viral particles.,PMC2739265,PMC2739265_3
"In a study on the role of viral proteins in immune evasion, researchers found that the viral protein NSP1 of the virus Chikungunya interacts with the cellular protein TBK1 to inhibit the activation of the host immune response. This interaction allows the virus to evade the host immune response and facilitate viral replication.",PMC2739265,PMC2739265_4
