"The study found that the accumulation of flaviviral satellite RNA (sfrna) in JEV-infected cells does not require viral RNA replication, as demonstrated by the accumulation of sfrna in cells electroporated with nonreplicating RNA constructs.",PMC6062100,PMC6062100_0
"The study identified a putative promoter element, the slii structure, as essential for sfrna accumulation, as deletion mutants made on the slii structure abolished all sfrna formation but did not give rise to smaller sfrna species.",PMC6062100,PMC6062100_1
"The study found that the initiation site of JEV sfrna is located at a 3'-cyclization-like motif, complementary to the 5' cyclization sequences, and may be involved in genome cyclization during antigenome synthesis.",PMC6062100,PMC6062100_2
The study found that the JEV sfrna is likely synthesized by transcription initially and then could be further trimmed by exoribonuclease XRN1 and/or other unidentified enzymes.,PMC6062100,PMC6062100_3
"The study found that the slii structure is responsible for sfrna synthesis, and the accumulation of smaller JEV RNA species did not occur upon deletion of the cyc-like motif in vivo.",PMC6062100,PMC6062100_4
