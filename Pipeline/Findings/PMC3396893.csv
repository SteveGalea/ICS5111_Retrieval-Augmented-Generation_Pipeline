A study of vampire bat rabies virus (RV) transmission in Peru found that RV is maintained regionally in bat populations over multiple years and is possibly mediated through frequency dependent transmission with a key role for juvenile and sub-adult bats.,PMC3396893,PMC3396893_0
"The study also found that there is no evidence for population thresholds for RV invasion and maintenance, consistent with the observed inefficacy of culling to eliminate viral circulation in bats and transmission to humans and domestic animals.",PMC3396893,PMC3396893_1
Future studies should identify the mechanistic basis for the relationship between culling and seroprevalence and use that information to inform epidemiological models of optimal rabies control in Latin America.,PMC3396893,PMC3396893_2
The study suggests that properly managed culling of vampire bats benefits agriculture through alleviating bat bites on livestock and possibly by reducing the total number of infected bats.,PMC3396893,PMC3396893_3
"However, the apparent positive effect of culling on seroprevalence, coupled with demographic and behavioral responses that might increase the proportion of susceptible bats, could have counterproductive consequences for RV transmission.",PMC3396893,PMC3396893_4
