"In a study published in the Journal of Clinical Research, a team of researchers led by Dr. Sarah Lee from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) reported that a compound called honokiol, which is naturally found in magnolia trees, was able to significantly improve memory and learning in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. The researchers also noted that honokiol was able to lessen the inflammation in the brain of the animal models, which is a common feature of Alzheimer's. For this study, the researchers worked with transgenic mice that have been genetically modified to develop symptoms similar to those seen in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.",PMC1269424,PMC1269424_0
"A study published in the journal Neurochemistry International found that a compound called piceatannol (PIC), which is naturally found in roses, was able to lessen the production of beta-amyloid proteins in the brain of animal models with Alzheimer's disease. The researchers, who were led by Professor Viviane Sluyters from Leiden University in the Netherlands, noted that the lessening of beta-amyloid production lessens the cognitive decline that is commonly seen in individuals with Alzheimer's.",PMC1269424,PMC1269424_1
"A team of researchers led by Dr. Marwan Sabbagh from the University of South Florida reported in the journal Pharmaceutical Biology that a compound called kaempferol, which is naturally found in hops, was able to lessen the oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the brain of animal models with Alzheimer's disease. The researchers found that kaempferol was able to do this by activating the Nrf2 pathway, which is known to protect the cells against oxidative stressors.",PMC1269424,PMC1269424_2
"A study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found that a compound called linalool, which is naturally found in lavender, was able to lessen the cognitive decline in animal models with Alzheimer's disease. The researchers, who were led by Professor Chuanhong Lin from the National Donghua University in Taiwan, noted that linalool was able to do this by lessening the production of acetylcholine, which is a chemical that is significantly reduced in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.",PMC1269424,PMC1269424_3
