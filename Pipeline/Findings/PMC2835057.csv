"In the context of a study on the development of anthrax vaccines, the findings include the induction of high-titered neutralizing antibody responses against the lethal factor (LF) and anthrax protective antigen (Pa) in rabbits following a single im injection using a plasmid expressing either Pa63 or LF, or both simultaneously. The study also found that the co-inoculation of rabbits with Raav vectors encoding either Pa63 or LF, or both simultaneously, led to the induction of high-titered neutralizing antibody responses against LF and Pa63.",PMC2835057,PMC2835057_0
