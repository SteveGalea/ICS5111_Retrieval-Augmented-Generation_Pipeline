"In this study, we identified a significant improvement in diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in immunocompromised patients with respiratory symptoms and fever compared to asymptomatic patients.",PMC3731857,PMC3731857_0
The study found a statistically significant correlation between the location of BAL and diagnostic yield. Patients with radiographic abnormalities in the alveoli or airways had a higher diagnostic yield compared to those with extra-alveolar abnormalities.,PMC3731857,PMC3731857_1
The study also demonstrated a higher diagnostic yield in patients with focal infiltrates compared to those with diffuse infiltrates.,PMC3731857,PMC3731857_2
"The study found that patients with chest symptoms, such as cough, sputum production, dyspnea, and pleuritis, had a higher diagnostic yield compared to asymptomatic patients.",PMC3731857,PMC3731857_3
The study revealed a significant variation in diagnostic yield based on the lobe of the lung that was lavaged. Patients with lower lobe lavage had a higher diagnostic yield compared to those with middle or upper lobe lavage.,PMC3731857,PMC3731857_4
"(Optional) The study reported a complication rate of 7.3% for BAL, with minor hemorrhage, pneumothorax, sustained hypoxemia, and intubation and mechanical ventilation being the most commonly observed complications.",PMC3731857,PMC3731857_5
(Optional) The study found that the number needed to harm (NNTH) for BAL was 13.6.,PMC3731857,PMC3731857_6
"(Optional) The study reported that 58 out of 79 cases with a positive diagnostic yield would have only been diagnosed through BAL, with 21 cases having a concurrent diagnosis through non-invasive testing.",PMC3731857,PMC3731857_7
"(Optional) The study reported that 16 out of 79 cases with a positive diagnostic yield had a positive nasal wash rapid virus (RVP) assay, and 5 out of 79 cases had a positive serum galactomannan (GM) antigen assay.",PMC3731857,PMC3731857_8
(Optional) The study reported that the number needed to diagnose (NNTH) for BAL was 1.9.,PMC3731857,PMC3731857_9
