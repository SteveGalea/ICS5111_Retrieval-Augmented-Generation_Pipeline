"This study detected and characterized coronaviruses (covs) in ten different bat species in Italy, including alpha-covs and beta-covs (2b and 2c lineages).",PMC3856409,PMC3856409_0
"The study found that group 2b beta-covs (mers-like covs) were detected only in lesser horseshoe bats, while alpha-covs were found in two samples collected from Kuhl's pipistrelle.",PMC3856409,PMC3856409_1
"The study also identified 10 novel clade 2c beta-covs from Kuhl's pipistrelle, common noctule, and savi's pipistrelle, which extends the current knowledge on this bat-cov clade with new sequences obtained from bats that have not been previously described as hosts of these groups of viruses.",PMC3856409,PMC3856409_2
The relatedness of MERS-cov to covs hosted at a high prevalence by pipistrellus spp. Bats across Europe and the occurrence of HKU5 cov in bats of this genus from China highlights the possibility that pipistrellus spp. Bats might be hosts of viruses closely related to MERS-cov.,PMC3856409,PMC3856409_3
"The risk of coronavirus infection and respiratory disease in humans remains low, and bats should not be considered liabilities, especially given the vital ecosystem functions they perform, as these mammals are highly sensitive to anthropogenic habitat alterations, and their conservation status is often vulnerable or threatened, since these mammals are valuable ecological service accomplishers through their pest-controlling actions.",PMC3856409,PMC3856409_4
