The INSPIRE study is a population-based longitudinal birth cohort enrolling term healthy infants during the first months of life to characterize the host phenotypic response to RSV infection and its association with early childhood wheezing and asthma development.,PMC4506623,PMC4506623_0
"The study aims to identify immune response and lung injury patterns associated with early childhood wheezing and asthma, as well as specific RSV strains contributing to these outcomes.",PMC4506623,PMC4506623_1
"During winter viral season, over 14,000 surveillance surveys were carried out resulting in 2,103 respiratory illness visits on 1,189 infants.",PMC4506623,PMC4506623_2
"The study has enrolled 1,952 infants (48% female) during the two enrollment years, with ongoing follow-up for wheezing and childhood asthma outcomes through 2016.",PMC4506623,PMC4506623_3
The study will advance our understanding of the complex causal relationship between RSV infection and early childhood wheezing and asthma through nested case-control studies and annual assessments of wheezing illness.,PMC4506623,PMC4506623_4
