"In the mouse model of spontaneous eae, regulatory T cells play a major role in preventing inflammation and tissue damage.",PMC1602407,PMC1602407_0
"In the same mouse model, the accumulation of CD4+3H12+ cells, as well as the down-modulation of surface expression of CD4 and TCR, were prevented by transferring CD4+ cells before the development of disease.",PMC1602407,PMC1602407_1
"In the same mouse model, the prevention of CNS tissue damage as a secondary effect of T-cell infiltration can be made by similar mechanisms in EAE model as well as in traumatic lesions of the spinal cord.",PMC1602407,PMC1602407_2
"In the same mouse model, a balance must be reached between effector T cells and regulatory T cells, and the absence of regulatory T cells leads to a harmful inflammatory response.",PMC1602407,PMC1602407_3
"In the mouse model of sci, T/R- mice, subjected to injury, exhibited a much stronger and more diffuse expression of GFAP than T/R+ mice, and GFAP expression extended to spinal cord areas located far away from the stab wound, such as the lumbar region of the spinal cord, while GFAP expression in T/R+ animals was restricted to the area of the lesion.",PMC1602407,PMC1602407_4
