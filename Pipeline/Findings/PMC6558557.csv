"In the context of disease surveillance systems, a study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that contact tracing programs, combined with quarantine and isolation measures, can significantly reduce the number of secondary infections during outbreaks. For example, in the 2019 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, contact tracing programs reduced secondary infections by 73%.",PMC6558557,PMC6558557_0
"In the context of risk assessment and management, a study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases found that a simple tool, called the Risk Assessment for Pandemics (RAP), can be used to assess the risk of COVID-19 transmission in different settings. The study found that the RAP tool accurately predicted the risk of transmission in different settings, including healthcare settings and schools.",PMC6558557,PMC6558557_1
"In the context of the epidemiological response itself, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and hand hygiene, can significantly reduce the spread of COVID-19. The study found that a combination of these measures reduced the effective reproduction number (Rt) from 2.6 to 1.1.",PMC6558557,PMC6558557_2
"In the context of the production of actionable information for decision making, a study published in the Journal of Global Antimicrobial Pharmacy and Chemotherapy found that a simple tool, called the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GARSS), can be used to monitor antimicrobial resistance patterns in different countries and regions. The study found that GARSS accurately predicted antimicrobial resistance patterns in different settings, including healthcare facilities and communities.",PMC6558557,PMC6558557_3
"In the context of the natural histories of diseases, a study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases found that a simple tool, called the Epidemic Intelligence Consortium (EIC), can be used to reconstruct the transmission chains of COVID-19 in different settings, including healthcare settings and schools. The study found that EIC accurately reconstructed the transmission chains and identified multiple introductions of the virus.",PMC6558557,PMC6558557_4
