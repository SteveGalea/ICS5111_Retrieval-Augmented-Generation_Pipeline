"The study involved the experimental infection of 10 pigs with swine influenza A virus (subtype H1N1) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), as well as detection of genes encoding dnt and porcine map (PM) in nasal swabs and lung tissue samples.",PMC3554491,PMC3554491_0
"The study found that the concentration of serum amyloid A (SAA) in pigs infected with swine influenza A virus and PRRSV was significantly higher than in control pigs, and that SAA levels were positively correlated with the severity of lung lesions.",PMC3554491,PMC3554491_1
"The study also found that the concentration of serum haptoglobin (HP) in pigs infected with swine influenza A virus and PRRSV was significantly higher than in control pigs, and that HP levels were positively correlated with the severity of lung lesions.",PMC3554491,PMC3554491_2
"The study observed significant increases in the concentrations of serum amyloid A (SAA) and serum haptoglobin (HP) in pigs infected with swine influenza A virus and PRRSV, as well as significant increases in the concentrations of serum amyloid A (SAA) and serum haptoglobin (HP) in pigs infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), compared to control pigs.",PMC3554491,PMC3554491_3
