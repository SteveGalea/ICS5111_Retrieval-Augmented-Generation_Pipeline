"A cross-sectional study found that viral infection in the upper respiratory tract alters the bacterial community in the tract, with a high pneumococcal colonization density and capsule polysaccharide and pneumolysin production reduced, and synthesis of the bacterial adhesin phosphorylcholine increased [121].",PMC4801059,PMC4801059_0
"In vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that viruses can promote entry and colonization of the lower respiratory tract for select bacterial species via a range of biological mechanisms, including urt biofilm dispersion, increased bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cell by upregulation of cell receptors, reduced pulmonary clearance, impairment of multiple components of the innate immune response, and changes in inflammatory response [92-94, 100, 104-105, 127-130].",PMC4801059,PMC4801059_1
"Viruses can increase nasopharyngeal carriage density and increase risk of pneumococcal pneumonia by altering bacterial selection in the upper respiratory tract, as observed in both human populations and animal models [26, 121].",PMC4801059,PMC4801059_2
"Viral infections can lead to impairment and depletion of resident alveolar macrophages and neutrophils necessary for bacterial clearance, mediated by induction of type I interferons, and desensitization to toll-like receptor ligands [101-103, 104].",PMC4801059,PMC4801059_3
"Viral infections can exacerbate inflammatory mediators, cytokines, and chemokines, causing tissue damage and increasing susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections in the lower respiratory tract [6].",PMC4801059,PMC4801059_4
