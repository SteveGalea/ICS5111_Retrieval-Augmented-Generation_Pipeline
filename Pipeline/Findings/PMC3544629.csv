"The study identified pediatric lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated LRTIs as a significant burden on the acute care setting in British Columbia, with a pronounced seasonal variability.",PMC3544629,PMC3544629_0
The study found that infants less than 1 year of age and high-risk infants had a higher incidence of LRTIs and longer hospital stays compared to other pediatric patients.,PMC3544629,PMC3544629_1
"The study estimated an increase in the pediatric population of approximately 17% by 2030, which may be a conservative estimate compared to other published reports, and may significantly impact the demand for LRTIs on pediatric inpatient settings.",PMC3544629,PMC3544629_2
"The study suggests that non-pharmacological intervention strategies, such as frequent hand washing and separating infected people from non-infected people, can significantly contribute to reducing the demand of LRTIs on pediatric inpatient settings, particularly during seasonal LRTI and RSV outbreaks.",PMC3544629,PMC3544629_3
"The study highlights the significance of developing targeted prevention strategies, as improved surveillance on the cause of pediatric LRTIs may provide valuable insight for assessing current and future demand, as well as for developing prevention strategies to be implemented at specific times of the year.",PMC3544629,PMC3544629_4
