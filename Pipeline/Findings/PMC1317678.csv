Glucose (gl) directly affects the viral envelope of enveloped viruses and reduces viral infectivity by lowering the fluidity of both the plasma membrane and viral envelope.,PMC1317678,PMC1317678_0
"Gl inhibits cell-to-cell fusion induced by HIV-1 and HIV-2, but not by poliovirus, by suppressing the formation of virological synapses.",PMC1317678,PMC1317678_1
"Gl-pretreated cells show enhanced susceptibility to infection and fusion due to increased fluidity, as the number of receptors and the degree of fluidity are the factors regulating the formation of a wide fusion pore of enveloped viruses.",PMC1317678,PMC1317678_2
"Gl-pretreated cells are less sensitive to gl treatment than those with less gp120, indicating that gl has the same effects on the membrane as temperature does, and viruses with more gp120 are less dependent on temperature.",PMC1317678,PMC1317678_3
