"The authors developed a new method for producing safe and potent wiv vaccines using ultrashort pulsed (USP) laser irradiation. This method preserves antigenicity while inactivating the virus through disruption of weak, noncovalent hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts in the virion, leading to improved safety profiles.",PMC4242973,PMC4242973_0
"The USP laser irradiation method does not generate significant levels of carbonyl groups in protein antigens compared to conventional pathogen inactivation methods, reducing the risk of detrimental vaccine-elicited th2 responses.",PMC4242973,PMC4242973_1
"The authors found that, within experimental uncertainty, the USP laser irradiation has no effects on the surface protein structure of the virus, suggesting that the laser-inactivated influenza vaccine has the potential to generate cross-protection against multiple strains.",PMC4242973,PMC4242973_2
"The authors demonstrated that the USP laser-inactivated influenza vaccine is significantly more efficient than the vaccine prepared by the conventional formalin-inactivated vaccine, using lower doses of vaccine antigens.",PMC4242973,PMC4242973_3
"The authors showed that the USP laser-inactivated vaccine does not generate significant levels of carbonyl groups in protein antigens compared to conventional pathogen inactivation methods, reducing the risk of side effects from vaccines prepared by the USP laser treatment method.",PMC4242973,PMC4242973_4
