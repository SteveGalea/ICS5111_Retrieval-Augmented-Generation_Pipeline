"In a study of 98 episodes of febrile neutropenia in immunocompromised patients, the overall sensitivity for detecting respiratory viruses using flocked nasal swabs (FNs) was 65%.",PMC3001728,PMC3001728_0
The sensitivity for detecting rhinovirus using FNs was 78%.,PMC3001728,PMC3001728_1
"When compared to nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), FNS showed a ""substantial"" agreement for any virus and an ""almost perfect"" agreement for rhinovirus according to Landis and Koch's scale.",PMC3001728,PMC3001728_2
"FNS collected a lower amount of epithelial cells compared to NPA, and there was a possible association between a high cell yield and low cycle threshold (Ct) values for NPA.",PMC3001728,PMC3001728_3
The sensitivity for detecting any virus using FNS was significantly lower than using NPA.,PMC3001728,PMC3001728_4
"The sensitivity for detecting rhinovirus using FNS was lower than using NPA in a study of immunocompromised adults, but it was slightly better when compared to previous investigations using FNS with a comparable insertion depth.",PMC3001728,PMC3001728_5
The lower sensitivity for FNS may be explained by less mucus production and consequently less anterior transport of viral nucleic acid in immunocompromised individuals.,PMC3001728,PMC3001728_6
FNS sampling of the nares for viral detection in immunocompromised individuals cannot be recommended until further large studies have revealed more promising results.,PMC3001728,PMC3001728_7
