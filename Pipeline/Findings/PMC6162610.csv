"A previously unknown sars virus genome sequence, named sars-cov-cpsr-19, was discovered in the sars-cov genome. This sequence is located in the orf3b gene of the sars-cov ma15 genome and is a 22-nt dna complemented palindrome (tctttaacaagcttgttaaaga).",PMC6162610,PMC6162610_0
"Sars-cov-cpsr-19 was found to significantly induce cell apoptosis, which is a key feature in sars-cov infection or pathogenesis. This was confirmed through rna interference (RNAi) experiments, as well as by measuring the expression levels of cell apoptosis marker genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from mitochondrial genomes.",PMC6162610,PMC6162610_1
"Sars-cov-cpsr-19 was discovered to play a role in sars-cov infection or pathogenesis, as it can form one hairpin and its tm (melting temperature) is around 20 °C. This suggests that most of sars-cov-cpsr-19 cannot be ligated to adapters during the small RNA (sRNA)-seq library preparation process at room temperature (~20 °C).",PMC6162610,PMC6162610_2
"The discovery of sars-cov-cpsr-19 and its role in sars-cov infection or pathogenesis provides insights into the mechanisms underlying viral infection or pathogenesis, as well as the potential interaction between viruses and host cells. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the infection or pathogenesis of both sars-cov-cpsr-19 and another sars virus small viral RNA named svrna-n are still unknown.",PMC6162610,PMC6162610_3
