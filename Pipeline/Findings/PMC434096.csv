The sars-cov u122 protein is encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) with a predicted signal sequence for transport to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).,PMC434096,PMC434096_0
"Mutation of the ER retrieval motif in u122 leads to rapid protein processing in transfected mammalian cells, with the majority of mutant protein being localized to the golgi compartment.",PMC434096,PMC434096_1
"Pulse-chase analysis reveals that the wild-type u122 protein is cotranslationally processed, with about 40% of the protein being processed posttranslationally.",PMC434096,PMC434096_2
"The u122 protein interacts specifically with another unique group-specific sars-cov protein, orf3a, and localizes to the ER and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, potentially indicating a role in virus replication, assembly, or infection.",PMC434096,PMC434096_3
"Convalescent-phase human sera cannot detect bacterially expressed u122-glutathione transferase fusion protein by western blot analysis, suggesting that u122 is either not a viral structural protein or that it is not sufficiently immunogenic in vivo.",PMC434096,PMC434096_4
