A study conducted in a large cohort of children with severe childhood malaria revealed that there are distinguishable changes in the plasma proteome profile associated with different malaria syndromes.,PMC3514223,PMC3514223_0
This study showed that there are significant differences in the plasma proteome profiles between children with severe malarial anemia or cerebral malaria and those with uncomplicated malaria.,PMC3514223,PMC3514223_1
The study also found that the degree of overlap between the plasma proteome profiles of children with cerebral malaria and those with severe malarial anemia is lower than that observed between the severe groups.,PMC3514223,PMC3514223_2
"These findings suggest that beyond the common underlying mechanisms, such as acute inflammation, there are significant differences in the pathogenesis of the severe malaria syndromes studied.",PMC3514223,PMC3514223_3
The study further highlighted the need for more specific protein markers to further deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of severe malaria syndromes.,PMC3514223,PMC3514223_4
