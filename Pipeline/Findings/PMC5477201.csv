"PDCoVs, belonging to the Deltacoronavirus genus of Coronaviridae family, have been reported in many countries, including South Korea, China, the United States, and Thailand.",PMC5477201,PMC5477201_0
"Until now, PDCoVs have caused clinical symptoms similar to Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED) in piglets.",PMC5477201,PMC5477201_1
"In South Korea, PDCoVs were detected in 2014 and 2015, and further complete genome sequences of viruses isolated in 2016 were sequenced to provide material for molecular analyses.",PMC5477201,PMC5477201_2
"The DH/2016 strains, isolated from a farm in South Korea, had very high nucleotide and amino acid identities to PDCoVs reported in China and the United States.",PMC5477201,PMC5477201_3
Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genomes of 65 isolates available in GenBank revealed that the DH/2016 strains belonged to a strain identified in 2014 by U.S. Groups and were separated from PDCoVs reported in both China and the United States.,PMC5477201,PMC5477201_4
