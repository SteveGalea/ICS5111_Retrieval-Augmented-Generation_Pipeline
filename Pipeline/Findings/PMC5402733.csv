"Rats anesthetized with co2 maintain normal circadian rhythms of melatonin, tfa, potassium, glucose, corticosterone, lactate, and leptin, while rats anesthetized with isoflurane exhibit disrupted circadian rhythms and increased levels of these hormones.",PMC5402733,PMC5402733_0
"Isoflurane anesthesia in rats causes hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and a shift in the insulin peak, with a marked hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia 8 hours prior to rats anesthetized with co2.",PMC5402733,PMC5402733_1
"Co2 anesthesia preserves normal physiologic circadian rhythms and blood levels of melatonin, tfa, potassium, glucose, corticosterone, lactate, and leptin, while isoflurane anesthesia disrupts these rhythms and increases levels of these hormones.",PMC5402733,PMC5402733_2
"Rats anesthetized with isoflurane exhibit a marked hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, with a shift in the insulin peak, and a significant reduction in potassium levels for most time points and a 12-hour shift in the insulin peak compared to rats anesthetized with co2.",PMC5402733,PMC5402733_3
"Co2 anesthesia is superior to isoflurane anesthesia in rats for short procedures, as it preserves normal physiologic circadian function that contributes to animal health and wellbeing, and supports unambiguous scientific outcomes, unlike isoflurane anesthesia, which disrupts normal circadian rhythms and blood levels of melatonin, tfa, potassium, glucose, corticosterone, lactate, and leptin.",PMC5402733,PMC5402733_4
