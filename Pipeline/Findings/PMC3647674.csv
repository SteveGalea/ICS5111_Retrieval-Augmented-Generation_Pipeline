"A novel betacoronavirus was detected in insectivorous nycteris bats in Ghana and Europe, belonging to the previously known 2c clade. This virus is phylogenetically basal to the human coronavirus EMCIV, as well as to two related bat coronaviruses recently identified in Europe.",PMC3647674,PMC3647674_0
"The prevalence of the novel coronavirus in nycteris bats was significantly higher in juvenile bats and lactating females than in adult and nonlactating females, respectively. Virus concentrations in feces were also high.",PMC3647674,PMC3647674_1
"The new virus, as well as the related viruses in Europe, were closely related to a virus recently identified in a patient in the Arabian Peninsula. This suggests the possibility of another human coronavirus with a potential animal reservoir in bats from the Old World.",PMC3647674,PMC3647674_2
The detection rates of coronaviruses were significantly higher among juvenile and lactating bats in a previous study of vespertilionid bats from temperate climates. This amplification may also apply to the nycteris bat coronavirus.,PMC3647674,PMC3647674_3
"The high virus concentrations, use of water from bat caves and guano as fertilizer for farming, and hunting of bats as wild game throughout Africa may facilitate host switching events. Further studies should still include isolation attempts to obtain full virus genomes and identify virulence factors contributing to the high pathogenicity of the newly identified coronaviruses.",PMC3647674,PMC3647674_4
