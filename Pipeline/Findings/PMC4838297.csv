"The study found that g6pd knockdown in human airway epithelial cells (A549) impairs the production of cox-2 and pge2 in response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) stimulation, which is linked to decreased nox activation and viral replication.",PMC4838297,PMC4838297_0
The study also revealed that g6pd deficiency affects viral infection by decreasing the epithelial inflammatory response through down-regulation of TNF-α-mediated nox-dependent pathways and subsequent inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling.,PMC4838297,PMC4838297_1
"The study demonstrated that g6pd-overexpressing macrophages increase the expression of proinflammatory genes via the activation of NF-κB, which is in agreement with previous findings.",PMC4838297,PMC4838297_2
"The study provided novel evidence suggesting that TNF-α-mediated NF-κB signaling is, in part, modulated by a close interaction between g6pd and nox.",PMC4838297,PMC4838297_3
"The study suggested that g6pd knockdown a549 cells can inhibit the TNF-α-mediated inflammatory response, which can have potential clinical implications.",PMC4838297,PMC4838297_4
