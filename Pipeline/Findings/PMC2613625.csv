"Rig-i, a key protein in the innate immune response, can bind and respond to both single-stranded and double-stranded RNA molecules, with the latter requiring a helicase domain for activation.",PMC2613625,PMC2613625_0
"The antagonist 2006, a modified single-stranded RNA molecule, can inhibit rig-i signaling and interfere with ligand binding by both the helicase and regulatory domains of rig-i, possibly through interactions with the atpase motif.",PMC2613625,PMC2613625_1
"Lgp2, a related RNA helicase, strongly prefers binding to double-stranded RNA molecules and binds them with cooperativity.",PMC2613625,PMC2613625_2
"Differential scanning fluorometry, a method for measuring protein unfolding, reveals that the rig-i dimer complexed with double-stranded RNA is a more stable structure than the complex with the antagonist 2006.",PMC2613625,PMC2613625_3
"Reconstruction of rig-i with ligand suggests that the rig-i dimer complexed with double-stranded RNA has more extensive surface interactions than the more open complex with antagonist 2006, possibly accounting for differences in thermal denaturation.",PMC2613625,PMC2613625_4
Rig-i conformational changes and signaling suggest that proper design and engineering of single-stranded RNA molecules will be needed to regulate signaling by a specific innate immune pathway.,PMC2613625,PMC2613625_5
The multitude of responses from rig-i is complex and likely reflects different rig-i monomer and oligomer conformations that could lead to different signaling responses.,PMC2613625,PMC2613625_6
"The 2006 dimer complex contains four distinct sets of contacts, suggesting that interactions of the antagonists induce additional interactions.",PMC2613625,PMC2613625_7
"Changes in the oligomer structures of innate immune receptors, including rig-i and toll-like receptor 3, will hold the key to downstream signaling.",PMC2613625,PMC2613625_8
"The resolution of the reconstruction prevents firm assignment of domains, but several features could help reduce the possibilities.",PMC2613625,PMC2613625_9
