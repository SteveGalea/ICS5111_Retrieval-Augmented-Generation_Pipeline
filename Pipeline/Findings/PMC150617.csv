The study found that mice lacking the chemokine CCL3 (also known as MCP-3) are more susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection due to reduced CD8+ T cell accumulation and activation in the brain.,PMC150617,PMC150617_0
"In the absence of CCL3 signaling, CD8+ T cells exhibit reduced interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production and limited cytotoxic activity, which contributes to impaired virus-specific CD8+ T cell effector function and disease.",PMC150617,PMC150617_1
The study also found that CCL3 is necessary for amplifying CD8+ T cell effector function and specifically affecting CD8+ T cell and macrophage trafficking following viral infection.,PMC150617,PMC150617_2
The study revealed that CCL3 expression is crucial not only in leukocyte recruitment to the site of infection but also in CD8+ T cell activation.,PMC150617,PMC150617_3
"The study showed that in the absence of CCL3 signaling, CD8+ T cells are capable of generating an antigen-specific response but are unable to generate effective T cells in host defense following viral infection of the brain due to altered migration potential, inability to produce IFN-γ, and deficient cytotoxic activity.",PMC150617,PMC150617_4
