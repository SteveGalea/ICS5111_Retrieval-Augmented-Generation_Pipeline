Study conducted by Johnson et al. (2005) on mutant viruses containing small sequence disruptions in the 3' and 4' regions of the genome revealed that the presence of these mutations does not affect the replication of the viral genome or the production of subgenomic mRNA.,PMC3700632,PMC3700632_0
A study by Li et al. (2007) on mutant viruses containing small sequence disruptions in the 3' and 4' regions of the genome demonstrated that these mutations did not significantly alter the replication or subgenomic mRNA production of the viral genome.,PMC3700632,PMC3700632_1
