"To effectively infect humans, sars-cov needs to undergo two major adaptation mutations at residues 479 and 487 on RBD. The former largely determines whether sars-cov can infect humans, while the latter likely determines whether sars-cov can maintain sustained infections in humans.",PMC2446986,PMC2446986_0
"A common theme running through these two mutations is that a free charge embedded in a hydrophobic environment is energetically detrimental to virus/receptor binding, while once formed, a salt bridge in a hydrophobic environment is highly stabilizing due to the low dielectric constant of the hydrophobic environment. Therefore, such free charges must be either neutralized or removed from the interface before effective viral infections can occur.",PMC2446986,PMC2446986_1
"The interactions between sars-cov and ACE2 from other hosts, such as raccoons, domestic cats, ferrets, and monkeys, impose an important initial selection on sars-cov infections, while other host cell factors may impose selections on later steps of the infections.",PMC2446986,PMC2446986_2
"Among the eight ACE2s, human, cattle, orangutan, and monkey ACE2s (with residues Lys31 and Asp38) appear to accommodate human viral strain hTor02 (with RBD residues Asn479 and Thr487) but not civet strain csz02 (Lys479 and Ser487), civet strain cgd05 (Arg479 and Ser487), or human strain hgd03 (Asn479 and Ser487) (Table 2).",PMC2446986,PMC2446986_3
"Civets and raccoons have the widest range of accommodations for different sars-cov strains and, therefore, may play the most important roles in transmitting different sars-cov strains. These findings provide important initial evaluations of the interactions between sars-cov and ACE2 from hosts other than humans and civets and highlight the need for future biochemical and structural studies to fully understand these virus-receptor interactions.",PMC2446986,PMC2446986_4
