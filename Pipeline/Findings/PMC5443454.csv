"As of 2016, 32 US hospitals had established high-level isolation units (HLIs) for treating patients with highly infectious diseases (HIDs), but 3 had closed due to resource allocation for other priorities.",PMC5443454,PMC5443454_0
"Of the 33 HLIs still operational, 19 use the unit for non-HID patients when not activated, and 14 use it exclusively for HID patients or for training.",PMC5443454,PMC5443454_1
"Perceived benefits of a dedicated HID unit include minimizing disruption of other patients, a constant state of readiness, and training opportunities.",PMC5443454,PMC5443454_2
"The estimated costs of developing a unit for 2 HID patients range from $1 million to $12 million, and 10 out of 19 hospitals with adaptive units prefer a dedicated unit.",PMC5443454,PMC5443454_3
"After the West Africa Ebola outbreak, most newly established US HLIs invested immense resources and effort into preparing for patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD). However, 14 HLIs not designated as Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) reported having spent $9.1 million more than they have been reimbursed for initially developing HLIU capabilities, and at least 3 former HLIs no longer maintain HLIU capabilities due to sustainability concerns.",PMC5443454,PMC5443454_4
