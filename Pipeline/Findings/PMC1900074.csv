"The sars-cov genome encodes eight putative accessory proteins, including the 7a protein. While most of these viral proteins are expressed during sars-cov infection, they appear to be dispensable for viral replication in cell culture and the mouse model.",PMC1900074,PMC1900074_0
The overexpression of the sars-cov 7a accessory protein induces apoptosis in a caspase-3-dependent manner. The efficient cleavage of the signal peptide of 7a suggests that newly synthesized 7a translocates first to the endoplasmic reticulum.,PMC1900074,PMC1900074_1
"The sars-cov 7a protein interacts predominantly with aa 224 and 225 within the c-terminal transmembrane domain of bcl-xl, a prosurvival member of the bcl-2 family. The replacement of a critical residue within this domain (y101â†’k) reduces the strength of the interaction significantly.",PMC1900074,PMC1900074_2
"Besides the 7a and envelope proteins, numerous other sars-cov proteins, such as the 3c-like protease, spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane, have also been shown to induce apoptosis. Some of these viral proteins, such as envelope, nucleocapsid, and membrane, induce apoptosis only in the absence of growth factors, while others, such as 3c-like protease, spike, and orfs 3a, 3b, and 7a, induce apoptosis under normal growth conditions.",PMC1900074,PMC1900074_3
"The overexpression of the prosurvival member of the bcl-2 family, bcl-xl, can block the induction of apoptosis by the sars-cov envelope protein. However, the induction of apoptosis by these viral proteins and their relative contributions to sars-cov-induced apoptosis have not been investigated in detail.",PMC1900074,PMC1900074_4
