"In a study on the potential use of mannosylated iron oxide nanoparticles (uspio) for imaging atherosclerotic plaques, researchers found that both d- and dm-uspio particles were phagocytosed by macrophages embedded in atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in a susceptibility-induced signal reduction in the aortic vessel wall on t1-weighted 3d gradient echo (gre) images. This effect was greater for dm-uspio than for d-uspio, indicating that dm-uspio is superior to d-uspio for the study of atherosclerotic lesions.",PMC3356181,PMC3356181_0
"Histological analyses showed that the uptake of dm- was higher than that of d-uspio in the aortic wall of rabbits, resulting in a greater reduction of signal from the aortic wall in mri scans. The distribution of dm-uspio in the liver and lung tended to be higher than that of d-uspio, suggesting that receptor-mediated endocytosis had a strong role in the internalization of dm-uspio by macrophages.",PMC3356181,PMC3356181_1
"In efforts to avoid potential bias due to roi placement affecting the results of imaging analysis, the average result from three different rois in snr measurements was used.",PMC3356181,PMC3356181_2
"The authors suggest that the observed differences in the uptake of dm- and d-uspio by rabbit atherosclerotic lesions are attributable to the binding of mannan to uspio, and further study is required to investigate the stability of bound mannan and to determine optimum dosage amounts.",PMC3356181,PMC3356181_3
"The authors posit that macrophages contained in atherosclerotic plaques are more sensitive to dm- than to d-uspio, making it possible to acquire plaque images at lower doses of contrast agent, and suggest that the affinity of dm-uspio particles for the atherosclerotic wall affects their uptake positively, but acknowledge that the amount of iron per unit weight was not different irrespective of the type of uspio used, and attribute this to technical difficulties with their preliminary arrangements for making nmr measurements.",PMC3356181,PMC3356181_4
