"The study presents validation and verification data for a new research-use aptima-format naat for detecting the fi-nvct strain of Chlamydia trachomatis, which selectively detects strains containing the c1515t mutation found to be the root cause of compromised detection in the AC2 assay.",PMC7014671,PMC7014671_0
The study reveals a high sensitivity and specificity of 100% for the detection of the fi-nvct strain and does not detect strains lacking the c1515t mutation.,PMC7014671,PMC7014671_1
"The study highlights the remarkable degree of homologous recombination and mutations that have occurred in Chlamydia trachomatis in recent millennia, as revealed in a large-scale genomic analysis of geographically and temporally diverse strains.",PMC7014671,PMC7014671_2
"The study suggests that the fi-nvct strain has reached high prevalence levels (>60%) in some segments of the infected population, as previously discovered in 2006.",PMC7014671,PMC7014671_3
The automated research-use only aptima-format fi-nvct surveillance test described in the study should facilitate the rapid completion of epidemiologic surveillance studies to estimate fi-nvct prevalence and track its geographic and temporal spread in people screened for STIs in Europe.,PMC7014671,PMC7014671_4
