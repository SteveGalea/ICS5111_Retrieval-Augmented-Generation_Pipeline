"The study found that most camels imported to Egypt from Sudan and East Africa were seropositive for MERS-CoV (88.7%) and virus genetic materials was detected in 5.3% (39/738) of the imported camels. Surprisingly, no human cases of MERS-CoV infection have been recorded among camel traders from these countries, which may be due to the lack of diagnostic tools and experience for virus detection or maybe due to the rarity of virus transmission from camels to humans.",PMC5356426,PMC5356426_0
"The study also revealed that MERS-CoV has become ubiquitous in Egypt, as the virus is not a newly emerged virus but has only recently been discovered, and it has been circulating for at least three decades. The study found that 91.4% of camels imported from Sudan and 75.8% of resident camels were seropositive for MERS-CoV antibodies. Analysis of the results based on age showed that adult camels had higher seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies (87.3%) compared with young camels (51.8%), and the number of confirmed PCR-positive MERS-CoV animals was significantly higher in females than males (p<0.05).",PMC5356426,PMC5356426_1
"Nucleotide sequencing of the amplicons from 15 of 41 PCR-positive samples for MERS-CoV genetic material, followed by phylogenetic analysis, showed that the sequences recovered in the current study in Egypt were distinct from those in clade A and B. This finding adds to the knowledge of host range of MERS-CoV, as except one sheep, all the 109 bats in the study were negative for MERS-CoV using both serology and molecular assays.",PMC5356426,PMC5356426_2
"The study found that the dromedary camel was the most likely source of MERS-CoV transmission to humans, as the virus has been circulating in camels for at least three decades, and it is not a newly emerged virus but has only recently been discovered. The study also revealed that the virus may have become ubiquitous in Egypt, as inter-market movement and transport stress may partially explain the higher seropositivity and molecular analysis results in samples obtained from the",PMC5356426,PMC5356426_3
