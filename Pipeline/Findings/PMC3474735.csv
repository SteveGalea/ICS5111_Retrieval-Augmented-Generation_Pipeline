"The study found a high prevalence of respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens in healthy children, with distinct associations between viruses and bacteria.",PMC3474735,PMC3474735_0
"The study confirmed the previously reported positive association between rhinoviruses and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and also found a strong negative association between Mycoplasma catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus.",PMC3474735,PMC3474735_1
The study suggests that the previously reported negative association between S. Pneumoniae and S. Aureus during nasopharyngeal carriage may be stronger in the presence of M. Catarrhalis.,PMC3474735,PMC3474735_2
The study highlights the importance of considering the abundance of viruses and bacteria in relation to specific respiratory diseases.,PMC3474735,PMC3474735_3
The study emphasizes the need for further investigation to unravel the underlying biological mechanisms and determine whether the observed associations are direct or dependent on other (unknown) determinants.,PMC3474735,PMC3474735_4
