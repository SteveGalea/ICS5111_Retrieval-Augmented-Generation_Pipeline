"Coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have been shown to evade detection by the innate immune system by sequestering their genome on membranous replication complexes and capping viral RNA to evade detection by one arm of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing machinery (Kopecky-Barr et al., 2007).",PMC2292640,PMC2292640_0
"A study by Zhou et al. (2007) demonstrated that MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV fail to induce type I interferon (IFN) responses in infected cells, but each virus encodes a specific set of IFN antagonizing proteins that block expression from IFN-inducible promoter reporter constructs when expressed in cells.",PMC2292640,PMC2292640_1
"Another study by Kopecky-Barragan et al. (2007) identified three SARS-CoV proteins, ORF3b, ORF6, and N protein, that interact with different elements of the IFN sensing and signaling pathways and enable a reduction in the anti-viral induction pathways from several different pathways.",PMC2292640,PMC2292640_2
"A study by Cervantes-Barragan et al. (2007) showed that TLR7, which senses the MERS-CoV virion or replication products to activate the IFN response in cells, is key to the rapid induction seen in certain cell types, and the lack of TLR7 inhibited IFN induction by MERS-CoV.",PMC2292640,PMC2292640_3
Another study by Cervantes-Barragan et al. (2007) found that Tlr7 is not needed for IFN induction by cytosine-guanine-methyl (CpG)-dsDNA but blocks IFN induction by MERS-CoV in certain cell types.,PMC2292640,PMC2292640_4
The study by Zhou et al. (2007) also suggested that MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have ways of evading death induced by macrophage (MP) by using the MP to evade the immune system and carry the,PMC2292640,PMC2292640_5
