The present study found that carriers of the arg972 variant of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (irs-1) gene have significantly lower serum angiotensin II (ACE2) levels and higher myocardial infarction (MI) severity scores compared to wild type irs-1 carriers after MI.,PMC4015180,PMC4015180_0
"In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of arg972 irs-1 in human cardiomyocytes abolished hypoxia-induced ACE2 expression, suggesting a causal relationship between arg972 irs-1 and decreased serum ACE2 levels in MI patients.",PMC4015180,PMC4015180_1
"The study also demonstrated that impairment of insulin/irs-1/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling by overexpression of arg972 irs-1, knockdown of endogenous irs-1, or PI3K inhibitor can abolish hypoxia-induced IRs-1-associated PI3K activity and ACE2 expression in human cardiomyocytes, which suggests a causal relationship between arg972 irs-1 and decreased serum ACE2 levels in MI patients.",PMC4015180,PMC4015180_2
"The findings suggest that insulin/irs-1/PI3K signaling is required for ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes, and that hypoxia can markedly enhance the induction effect of insulin/irs-1/PI3K signaling on ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes.",PMC4015180,PMC4015180_3
"The study provides the first evidence of crosstalk between insulin/irs-1/PI3K signaling and ras after MI, thereby adding fresh insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of MI.",PMC4015180,PMC4015180_4
