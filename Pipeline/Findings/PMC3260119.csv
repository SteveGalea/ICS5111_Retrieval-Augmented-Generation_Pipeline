"The study developed a rapid and simple reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for detecting wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), which had a detection sensitivity of 100 times more than conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and did not require specialized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis equipment.",PMC3260119,PMC3260119_0
"The RT-LAMP method used a set of four specific primers for WYMV, and the primer set iii, which targeted the 72 kDa gene, was chosen for virus detection due to its high specificity.",PMC3260119,PMC3260119_1
"The RT-LAMP method allowed for detection of WYMV after 30-45 minutes, considering the field application where turbidity was observed by naked eyes as the criteria to judge that the sample was negative or positive.",PMC3260119,PMC3260119_2
"The study demonstrated the RT-LAMP method's potential application in early diagnosis and screening of resistant wheat varieties to reduce the loss of yield, due to its high level of detection sensitivity and convenience for field detection.",PMC3260119,PMC3260119_3
