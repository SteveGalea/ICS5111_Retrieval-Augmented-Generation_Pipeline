Prevalence: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is present in respiratory tract samples of 10.3% of hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections.,PMC4125703,PMC4125703_0
"Viral load: High viral loads of HBoV are predominantly found in the absence of other viral agents, while low viral loads are primarily detected in co-detection with other viruses.",PMC4125703,PMC4125703_1
Seasonality: HBoV infection rates are highest in summer.,PMC4125703,PMC4125703_2
Association with severity: HBoV with a high viral load is associated with severe respiratory tract infections and is more prevalent among children with dyspnea and wheezing.,PMC4125703,PMC4125703_3
Single detection: HBoV single detection with a high viral load could be an etiological agent of severe respiratory tract infections.,PMC4125703,PMC4125703_4
