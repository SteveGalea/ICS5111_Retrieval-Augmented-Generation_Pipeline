"The presented inverse folding algorithm, inv, successfully generates sequences that fold into neutral networks of rna pseudoknot structures. This is a significant finding because it allows for the prediction and construction of large neutral networks of rna pseudoknot structures, which was previously not possible due to the complexity of the problem. The algorithm is based on the fact that each 3-noncrossing rna structure has a unique loop-decomposition, and it generates ""optimal"" subsequences and eventually arrives at a global solution for the target rna structure.",PMC2909241,PMC2909241_0
"The presented inverse folding algorithm, inv, has a complexity of O(ℓh) for each interval, where c(ℓh) denotes the complexity of cross(seq) = t. This finding is important because it allows for the efficient execution of the algorithm for rna structures of varying lengths.",PMC2909241,PMC2909241_1
"The presented algorithm, inv, successfully generates sequences for a variety of natural rna structures, including nonplanar 3-noncrossing structures.

"The presented algorithm, inv, has an average inverse folding time of 2.49 seconds for a rna structure with a length of 76. This finding is important because it provides insights into the computational complexity of the algorithm and can aid in the optimization of the algorithm for larger rna structures.",PMC2909241,PMC2909241_3
