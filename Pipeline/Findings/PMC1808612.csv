This study found that the ratio of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) to interleukin-10 (IL-10) in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) of infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is lower than in infants without RSV infection.,PMC1808612,PMC1808612_0
"The study also showed that absolute IFN-γ concentrations in NPAs are lower during RSV infection compared to other viral infections, such as rhinovirus infection.",PMC1808612,PMC1808612_1
The study did not demonstrate any differences in cytokine responses between atopic and non-atopic infants during RSV infection.,PMC1808612,PMC1808612_2
"The study suggests that RSV infection is associated with a lower IFN-γ level in NPAs, unlike other respiratory viral infections, and raises the possibility that RSV may serve as an exception to the hygiene hypothesis during acute infections.",PMC1808612,PMC1808612_3
"The study found that infants with RSV infection had a lower median age of 241 days compared to infants without RSV-related wheezing, but this difference was not significant.",PMC1808612,PMC1808612_4
