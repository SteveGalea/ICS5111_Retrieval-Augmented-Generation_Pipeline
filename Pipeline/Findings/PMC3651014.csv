"The study found mixed trends in childhood asthma mortality and hospitalizations across the Asia Pacific region. While 6 out of 9 selected countries showed a decrease in mortality, only 4 countries showed a decrease in hospitalizations.",PMC3651014,PMC3651014_0
"The study observed a significant increase in asthma drug sales, particularly in relievers, across the Asia Pacific region, although the characteristics of the asthma drug sales ratio (c:r) should be considered.",PMC3651014,PMC3651014_1
"The study noted a negative correlation between trends in asthma mortality or hospitalization rates and asthma drug sales ratios (c:r) in Australia, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Singapore, although these findings did not reach statistical significance.",PMC3651014,PMC3651014_2
The study observed a downward kink in both asthma hospitalization rates and c:r in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region coinciding with the outbreak of severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.,PMC3651014,PMC3651014_3
"The study found that asthma hospitalization rates and c:r ratios in Thailand and Taiwan, Republic of China, remained relatively stable, although they experienced an increase in asthma prevalence rates in recent years. However, the study suggests that a multipronged approach, including proper counseling, social support, and access to quality medical care, is probably necessary to reduce the mortality and hospitalizations in asthmatic children.",PMC3651014,PMC3651014_4
