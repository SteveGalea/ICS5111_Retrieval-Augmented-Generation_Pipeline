"In a study investigating the effects of tgev infection on weanling piglets, it was found that piglets infected with tgev exhibited decreased intestinal integrity, leading to increased intestinal permeability and translocation of enteric bacteria. This, in turn, resulted in a more severe form of neonatal diarrhea, characterized by a higher incidence of clinical signs and a more prolonged duration of diarrhea.",PMC5640843,PMC5640843_0
"Another study reported that infection with tgev in weanling piglets was associated with impaired mucosal barrier function, as evidenced by increased intestinal permeability and mucosal shedding. This, in turn, led to the translocation of enteric bacteria to extra-intestinal sites, causing a more severe form of neonatal diarrhea.",PMC5640843,PMC5640843_1
"In a third investigation, it was observed that weanling piglets infected with tgev had a more severe form of neonatal diarrhea, characterized by a higher incidence of clinical signs, such as watery diarrhea, dehydration, and anorexia, as well as a more prolonged duration of diarrhea.",PMC5640843,PMC5640843_2
"A fourth study demonstrated that infection with tgev in weanling piglets resulted in a more severe form of neonatal diarrhea, as indicated by a higher incidence of clinical signs, such as watery diarrhea, dehydration, and anorexia, as well as a more prolonged duration of diarrhea, which was attributed to impaired mucosal barrier function and increased intestinal permeability.",PMC5640843,PMC5640843_3
"In a fifth study, it was found that weanling piglets infected with tgev had a more severe form of neonatal diarrhea, characterized by a higher incidence of clinical signs, such as watery diarrhea, dehydration, and anorexia, as well as a more prolonged duration of diarrhea. This, in turn, was associated with impaired mucosal barrier function and increased intestinal permeability.",PMC5640843,PMC5640843_4
"In a sixth investigation, it was reported that weanling piglets infected with tgev had a more severe form of neonatal diarrhea,",PMC5640843,PMC5640843_5
