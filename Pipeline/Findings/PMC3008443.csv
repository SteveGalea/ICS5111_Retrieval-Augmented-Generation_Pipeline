"This study found that the most prevalent HBV subgenotype in northern China is C2, followed by B2.",PMC3008443,PMC3008443_0
Patients with HBV/C2 infection are more likely to have disease progression than those with HBV/B2 infection.,PMC3008443,PMC3008443_1
"Patients with HBV/C2 infection have a higher incidence of precore mutations G1896A than those with HBV/B2 infection, while HBV/B2 infection is associated with a lower incidence of BCP mutations A1762T/G1764A.",PMC3008443,PMC3008443_2
The study also found differences in lam- and Adefovir (ADV)-resistance-associated mutational patterns between HBV/B2 and HBV/C2 infection.,PMC3008443,PMC3008443_3
The results suggest that HBV subgenotypes may have an impact on drug resistance and antiviral response to ADV treatment in clinical practice.,PMC3008443,PMC3008443_4
