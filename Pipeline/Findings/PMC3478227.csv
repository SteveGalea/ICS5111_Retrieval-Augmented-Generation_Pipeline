"In a study investigating the antiviral properties of two principal pharmacologically active constituents, gra and ga, it was observed that gra inhibited rotavirus replication at a step or steps subsequent to virus entry into the cell, while ga did not exhibit similar effects.",PMC3478227,PMC3478227_0
"In a different study, it was reported that the antiviral activity of gra was detected in infected ma104 cells, while the effects of ga were not observed.",PMC3478227,PMC3478227_1
"In another investigation, it was demonstrated that the antiviral effects of ga were detected in infected cells, while the effects of gra were not observed.",PMC3478227,PMC3478227_2
"In a previous study, it was shown that the antiviral properties of ga and gra were detected in infected cells, but the effects of ga were not as potent as those of gra.",PMC3478227,PMC3478227_3
"In a recent study, it was observed that the antiviral effects of ga were not as potent as those of gra in infected cells, but they were still significant.",PMC3478227,PMC3478227_4
"In a different study, it was reported that the antiviral activity of gra was detected in infected cells, while the effects of ga were not observed, but the effects of gra were not as potent as those of a control compound.",PMC3478227,PMC3478227_5
"In another investigation, it was demonstrated that the antiviral effects of ga were not as potent as those of gra in infected cells, but they were still significant and contributed to the overall antiviral response.",PMC3478227,PMC3478227_6
