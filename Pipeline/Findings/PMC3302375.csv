"The study identified a diverse range of viruses in pine marten and European badger feces, including viruses from the orders Caudovirales, Picornavirales, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, and Microviridae. The study also discovered a new potential mycovirus in European badgers.",PMC3302375,PMC3302375_0
"The study revealed that the majority of bacteriophage sequences in pine martens and European badgers belonged to the order Caudovirales and to single-stranded DNA viruses in the family Microviridae, as was observed before in viral metagenomics studies of the feces of horses, humans, and California sea lions.",PMC3302375,PMC3302375_1
"The study identified a new potential mycovirus in European badgers and a new anellovirus from pine marten rectal swabs, as well as a new potential circovirus-like virus from European badgers.",PMC3302375,PMC3302375_2
"The study found that the newly identified pine marten anellovirus belongs to a new genus within the anellovirus family, which was provisionally named xitorquevirus in analogy to the classification of torque teno viruses in nine genera named alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, eta-, iota-, theta-, and zetatorquevirus, and the proposed four genera kappa-, lambda-, mu-, and nutorquevirus.",PMC3302375,PMC3302375_3
"The study discovered a new potential bocavirus from pine marten feces, representing a new bocavirus species. The discovery of these viruses highlights the need for expanding our knowledge of virus diversity present in the animal reservoir, as sequence-independent amplification of viral nucleic acid in combination with a next-generation sequencing platform provides a relatively simple, unselective technology to identify new viral species, as was observed previously with similar techniques.",PMC3302375,PMC3302375_4
