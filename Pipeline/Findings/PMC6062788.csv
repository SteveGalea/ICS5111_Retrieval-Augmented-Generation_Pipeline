"The Xpert Flu/RSV XC and Xpert Xpress assays are rapid molecular tests capable of detecting and differentiating influenza A, influenza B, and RSV viruses from nasal wash fluid samples/aspirates and nasopharyngeal swabs.",PMC6062788,PMC6062788_0
"The Xpert Flu/RSV XC assay has positive percent agreements (PPAs) of 97.8% for influenza A, 97.2% for influenza B, and 89.3% for RSV relative to laboratory-developed tests (LDTs).",PMC6062788,PMC6062788_1
"The Xpert Xpress assay, introduced in 2017, offers improved sensitivity and specificity, with a reduced time to result of 32 minutes compared to the 63-minute time of the Xpert Flu/RSV XC assay.",PMC6062788,PMC6062788_2
"In a study of 201 nasopharyngeal swabs, the Xpert Xpress assay showed 100% accuracy compared to LDTs, while the Xpert Flu/RSV XC assay had accuracies of 94.6%, 100%, and 98.7% for influenza A, influenza B, and RSV, respectively.",PMC6062788,PMC6062788_3
"The Xpert Xpress assay's expanded design provides consistently lower limits of detection for each virus compared to the Xpert Flu/RSV XC assay, indicating improved analytical sensitivity.",PMC6062788,PMC6062788_4
