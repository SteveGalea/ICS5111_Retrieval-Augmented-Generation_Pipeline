"The study describes the identification of cinanserin, a serotonin receptor antagonist, as an inhibitor of sars-cov and hcov-229e through a combination of biochemical and tissue culture-based assays.",PMC1112131,PMC1112131_0
"Cinanserin binds and inhibits the activity of recombinant sars-cov and hcov-229e 3clpro, as predicted by virtual screening using a 3D model of sars-cov 3clpro.",PMC1112131,PMC1112131_1
"Cinanserin greatly reduces sars-cov and hcov-229e replication in cell culture, with a virus level reduction of over 3 to 4 log units, while there is no evidence of cytotoxicity at the inhibitory concentration.",PMC1112131,PMC1112131_2
"The study suggests that cinanserin specifically inhibits coronavirus replicase function, as it neither binds to nor inhibits the activity of hrv-14 3cpro.",PMC1112131,PMC1112131_3
"Cinanserin is a drug that has already undergone clinical evaluation, as it was synthesized and characterized as a serotonin inhibitor by the Squibb Institute for Medical Research in the 1960s. Its anti-sars-cov activity demonstrated in this study may serve as a lead substance for the design of more active inhibitors of 3cl proteinase with reduced toxicity and antiserotonin activity.",PMC1112131,PMC1112131_4
