"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are vasoactive neuropeptides (VNs) found in various structures of the mammalian eye, including the retina.",PMC2709019,PMC2709019_0
"VN receptors, such as VIP and PACAP receptors, are class II G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate adenylate cyclase (AC) to produce cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the retina of mammals.",PMC2709019,PMC2709019_1
"ATP is a vasoactive signal in the microvasculature of the rat retina, and failure to metabolize ATP adequately may result in elevated extracellular ATP levels and set in train perturbations of purinergic signaling, initiating significant neuro- and retino-toxicity.",PMC2709019,PMC2709019_2
"PACAP has protective effects on retinal degeneration, and its role in relaxation of pericytes may form the basis for a diagnostic procedure for diabetic retinopathy.",PMC2709019,PMC2709019_3
"Autoimmunity against VNs, such as VIP and PACAP, may result in impaired cAMP production and have significant detrimental impacts on retinal viability and function, suggesting potential therapeutic interventions, such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, to restore cAMP levels and prevent atypical purinergic signaling.",PMC2709019,PMC2709019_4
