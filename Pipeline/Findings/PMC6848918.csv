"During a six-month longitudinal study in a training yard in Ireland, 18 horses seroconverted to equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), and 17 of these seroconversions occurred in two-year-old horses.",PMC6848918,PMC6848918_0
"The majority of ERAV infections, i.e., 13 out of 18 seroconversions, occurred in May and June, and all but one of these horses had clinical respiratory signs, including inappetence, dullness, nasal discharge, limb oedema, enlarged submandibular lymph nodes, and occasional coughing.",PMC6848918,PMC6848918_1
The study found a significant association between ERAV infection and subsequent failure to race in young racehorses.,PMC6848918,PMC6848918_2
"The study revealed that ERAV infection may be underestimated in the interruption of training programs for young horses, as over 55% of the two-year-old horses in the study seroconverted to ERAV in May and June, and none of them raced at that time.",PMC6848918,PMC6848918_3
"The study also found that ERBV, another respiratory virus, was less commonly detected, with only one horse seroconverting to ERBV during the study period.",PMC6848918,PMC6848918_4
