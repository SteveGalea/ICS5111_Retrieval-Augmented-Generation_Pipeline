The use of nanoparticles in vaccinology is inspired by the fact that most pathogens have a dimension within the nano-size range and leads to a potent immune response.,PMC5629800,PMC5629800_0
The study reports a facile approach to increase antigen size using nanodiamond particles for a fast and effective response against the recombinant ha/h7n9 protein.,PMC5629800,PMC5629800_1
"The study demonstrates the successful conjugation of the trimeric haemagglutinin (h7) onto the surface of nanodiamond particles, resulting in a mixture containing the protein and nanodiamond that elicits a statistically significant stronger h7-specific-igg response after two immunizations.",PMC5629800,PMC5629800_2
"The study suggests a potential effect inherent to nanodiamond towards modulating immune systems, which should be further evaluated and broadly applied in nanovaccine development.",PMC5629800,PMC5629800_3
"The study highlights the importance of nanoparticles in vaccine development due to their ability to process efficiently by the immune system, resulting in a potent immune response.",PMC5629800,PMC5629800_4
