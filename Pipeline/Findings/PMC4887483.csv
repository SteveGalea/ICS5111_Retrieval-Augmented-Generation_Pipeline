"The study found that exposure to high d-glucose concentrations stimulates constitutive proteolytic shedding of ace2 fragments from mouse proximal tubular cells, with an effect blocked by the adam17 inhibitor.",PMC4887483,PMC4887483_0
"The study also showed that inhibition of the pkc-δ isoform, which is a critical upstream regulator of ace2 shedding in these cells, reduces constitutive proteolytic shedding of ace2 and blocks high d-glucose- or adam17-stimulated ace2 shedding.",PMC4887483,PMC4887483_1
The study suggests that preservation of membrane-bound ace2 may be important in counteracting local activation of the ras and could represent a strategy to prevent urinary ace2 shedding under basal or high d-glucose conditions.,PMC4887483,PMC4887483_2
"The study highlights the complexity of pathways involved in proteolytic cleavage of ace2, which may be affected by cell-specific regulatory signals or ambient glucose concentration.",PMC4887483,PMC4887483_3
The study suggests that genetic deletion or pharmacologic blockade of pkc-δ in mouse models of diabetes or proteinuria could represent a strategy to prevent urinary ace2 shedding from proximal tubular cells and reduce kidney injury and tubular cell apoptosis.,PMC4887483,PMC4887483_4
