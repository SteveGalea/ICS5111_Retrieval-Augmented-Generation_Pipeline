"The mers-cov strain, hku205, has a unique s2′ site in the spike protein that is activated by trypsin-like proteases, such as cathepsin L, and furin, but not by furin alone.",PMC5180369,PMC5180369_0
"The hku205 s2′ site has two substitutions, a886s to a886i at position 886 and a888i to a888t at position 888, which are unique to hku205 among sequenced mers-cov strains.",PMC5180369,PMC5180369_1
"The hku205 s2′ site has a reduced range of proteases for fusion activation, resulting in decreased cell and host tropism and infectivity.",PMC5180369,PMC5180369_2
"The hku205 s2′ site substitution with the furin site found in emc/2012 significantly increased fusogenicity and infectivity, but did not restore them to the levels observed for wild-type emc/2012 s-pseudovirions.",PMC5180369,PMC5180369_3
"The hku205 s2′ site alterations suggest that hku205 has a limited ability to cross the species barrier, and that the furin site found in most mers-cov samples may have been an important contributing factor for zoonotic transmission of the virus.",PMC5180369,PMC5180369_4
