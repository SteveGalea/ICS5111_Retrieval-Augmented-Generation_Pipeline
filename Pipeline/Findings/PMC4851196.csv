"In patients with hematological malignancies, the most serious and life-threatening event associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the occurrence of CMV disease, particularly in those patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.",PMC4851196,PMC4851196_0
"CMV reactivation is detected in the blood of 40-60% of hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, with clinical syndromes including delayed engraftment, fever, rash, hepatitis, pneumonitis, gastroduodenitis, and encephalitis in some cases.",PMC4851196,PMC4851196_1
"Encephalitis due to CMV is the most serious clinical syndrome associated with CMV infection, although it is a rare event, occurring only in 1-2% of patients, particularly after cord blood or human leukocyte antigen-mismatched graft.",PMC4851196,PMC4851196_2
"The diagnosis of CMV infection can be obtained using quantitative PCR-based evaluation of CMV DNA copies per ml in whole blood, plasma, or serum, but chromosomally integrated CMV should be excluded, as the prevalence of vertical transmission from mother/father is about 1%.",PMC4851196,PMC4851196_3
"Preemptive treatment is based on a positive antigenemia or PCR (either ganciclovir or foscarnet can be used for first-line preemptive treatment), whereas valganciclovir may be considered as an alternative therapy, particularly in low-risk patients (except those with intestinal graft-versus-host disease).",PMC4851196,PMC4851196_4
"The treatment of established CMV disease is based on the use of ganciclovir or foscarnet with the addition of immune globulin, and cidofovir or a combination of ganciclovir and foscarnet can be used as second-line therapy.",PMC4851196,PMC4851196_5
"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection may be associated with many symptoms, including cold episodes, croup, bronchiolitis in children, and exacerbation of asthma or frank pneumonia in adults, but the most serious and life-threatening event associated with EBV infection is the occurrence of post-transplant lymphoproliferative",PMC4851196,PMC4851196_6
