"In the simulation-based program for managing patients during an Ebola outbreak, participants reported a significant increase in confidence in managing a contamination breach, although this was not a direct focus of the training program.",PMC6354722,PMC6354722_0
"The program utilized a high-fidelity simulation environment for the simulation patient experience station, but other skill areas were not directly covered in the training.",PMC6354722,PMC6354722_1
The program included repeated practice of a complex donning and doffing process with many specific steps to complete.,PMC6354722,PMC6354722_2
The program encouraged institutions to follow nationally and internationally accepted protocols as closely as possible for managing a breach.,PMC6354722,PMC6354722_3
The program included shorter sessions of follow-up training at regular intervals to ensure retention of skills over time.,PMC6354722,PMC6354722_4
The program utilized a high faculty-to-participant ratio in order to replicate the high level of supervision that occurs when monitors supervise donning and doffing techniques in the clinical setting.,PMC6354722,PMC6354722_5
The program recommended shorter courses at regular intervals for ensuring retention of skills over time.,PMC6354722,PMC6354722_6
"The program utilized a faculty-intensive design, but potential reductions in faculty requirements could be explored by utilizing core teaching faculty in the monitor role in the one-to-one donning and doffing sessions.",PMC6354722,PMC6354722_7
"The program recommended that institutions follow nationally and internationally accepted protocols for defining competency, training modalities, and frequency of those modalities.",PMC6354722,PMC6354722_8
"The program suggested that institutions could look to other industries, such as aviation, as a gold standard for competency measurement and evaluation.",PMC6354722,PMC6354722_9
