"The ups is a cellular pathway that is hijacked by several viruses, including HIV, to counteract cellular restriction factors. This pathway is involved in the degradation of various cellular proteins, including restriction factors such as BST-2, A3G, and ICAM-1, as well as other proteins involved in immune signaling, DNA replication and repair, and chromatin organization.",PMC5707529,PMC5707529_0
"HIV-2 and some SIV strains lack the VPU protein, which is expressed from the same transcript as ENV by leaky scanning. These viruses rely on other accessory proteins, such as NEF or NEDD4, to counteract BST-2.",PMC5707529,PMC5707529_1
"The HIV auxiliary protein VPR can induce the degradation of multiple cellular proteins, such as DICER, MCM10, and histone deacetylases, as well as the cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase. VPR also enhances HIV-1 production in macrophages by reducing the encapsidation of UNG2 and promoting the degradation of A3G.",PMC5707529,PMC5707529_2
"The HIV auxiliary protein VPU can induce the degradation of CD4, ICAM-1, SNAAT-1, and UNG2, as well as the cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase. VPU also enhances HIV-1 production in macrophages by reducing the encapsidation of UNG2 and promoting the degradation of A3G.",PMC5707529,PMC5707529_3
