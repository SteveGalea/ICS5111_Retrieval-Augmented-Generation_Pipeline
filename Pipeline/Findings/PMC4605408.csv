"The study found that 59.7% of hospitalized children with respiratory symptoms in Mexico City had at least one viral infection, with rhinovirus being the most frequent pathogen.",PMC4605408,PMC4605408_0
"The study revealed a significant association between human rhinovirus (HRV) infection and respiratory distress and asthma diagnosis, with HRV-c subtype showing a relationship with asthma.",PMC4605408,PMC4605408_1
"Contrary to previous reports, the study did not find a relationship between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and asthma or wheezing, but did find a significant association between RSV infection and diarrhea, hyporexia, and crackles.",PMC4605408,PMC4605408_2
The study found that human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection was associated with longer hospitalization lengths in children.,PMC4605408,PMC4605408_3
"The study did not find a relationship between HRV infection and symptoms or laboratory parameters, except for fever, but did report a high proportion of children presenting with wheeze and HRV infection.",PMC4605408,PMC4605408_4
"The study highlighted the need for further analysis of HRV-c subtype in order to understand its role in respiratory diseases, particularly in asthma illnesses.",PMC4605408,PMC4605408_5
"The study provided important insights into the genomics, epidemiology, and clinical impact of HRV-c subtype in order to be able to respond effectively to future outbreaks, particularly in developing countries.",PMC4605408,PMC4605408_6
"The study emphasized the importance of molecular detection and characterization of viral pathogens present in respiratory diseases, particularly in children in developing countries, where viruses are often considered to be of little health impact and clinical significance.",PMC4605408,PMC4605408_7
"The study highlighted the need for further research to confirm the clinical importance and significance of HRV-c subtype in respiratory diseases, particularly in asthma illnesses, given the emerging clinical importance of HRV in respiratory diseases, particularly in children.",PMC4605408,PMC4605408_8
