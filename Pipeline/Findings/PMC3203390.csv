"In this population-based study, variants in the RFC1, SCN1A, and ANPEP genes were identified as potentially implicated in susceptibility to severe West Nile virus disease. The association between a variant in RFC1 and severe disease was confirmed in a replication cohort, while variants in SCN1A and ANPEP did not replicate.",PMC3203390,PMC3203390_0
"The study highlights the importance of conducting human population-based studies, as it found no evidence of an effect of the 32-bp deletion in CCR5 on clinical symptoms, in contrast to a previously reported association.",PMC3203390,PMC3203390_1
The study identified no significant effects of variants in the OAS gene cluster or TLR3 on West Nile virus disease.,PMC3203390,PMC3203390_2
"The study found no evidence of any systematic differences in phenotype data, including adjustment for ancestry informative markers, to explain the lack of replication for a variant in RFC1.",PMC3203390,PMC3203390_3
"The study identified no association between any of the OAS polymorphisms and West Nile virus, highlighting the importance of conducting human population-based studies.",PMC3203390,PMC3203390_4
