"Resveratrol, a main biologically active ingredient of Rhizoma Polygoni Cuspidate, effectively reduces the virus titer of Dev in defs in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 and si at 3.85 μg/mL and 15.86 μg/mL, respectively. A high inhibitory effect (>75%) is observed when the concentration of resveratrol is 31.25 μg/mL.",PMC3679110,PMC3679110_0
"Real-time FQ-PCR assay based on Taqman technology, which was performed in this paper, provides an accurate means to quantify viral DNA. Dev particles begin to reproduce 12 h after inoculation and dramatically increase to a peak value at 48 h p.i. Resveratrol can inhibit the stage of virus intracellular proliferation, which affects the early stage of Dev replication in the host cell's nucleus, where the genomes of the virus are translated, and some early viral proteins are expressed for further transcription and replication of the viral DNA.",PMC3679110,PMC3679110_1
"The time of addition assay and the TEM assays give evidence that support the hypothesis that resveratrol affects the early stage of the Dev replication cycle in the host cell's nucleus, which further provides evidence that support the conclusion of the assay on mode of action and further limits the scope of antiviral targets to the host cell's nucleus.",PMC3679110,PMC3679110_2
The results of the time of addition assay and the TEM assays show that a large number of virus nucleic acids and virus capsids did not observe in the host cell's nucleus compared with the control group. Resveratrol might have an important function in the regulation of gene transcription and expression to some early proteins that are essential to Dev replication in defs.,PMC3679110,PMC3679110_3
"After incubation for 24 h, protein expression in Dev infected defs is effectively inhibited by resveratrol. The accurate target of resveratrol should be confirmed in further investigations.",PMC3679110,PMC3679110_4
