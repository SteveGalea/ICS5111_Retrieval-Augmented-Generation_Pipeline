"Study found that among children under 5 with respiratory tract infection, human bocavirus (hBV) was detected in 4.4% and was the third most common etiological agent after RSV and hMPV.",PMC3291226,PMC3291226_0
"hBV was detected from December to June, indicating a possible epidemiological difference from RSV, hMPV, and influenza A virus.",PMC3291226,PMC3291226_1
"hBV infections were mainly identified in children with lower respiratory tract diseases, such as bronchiolitis, and were less frequently associated with upper respiratory infection.",PMC3291226,PMC3291226_2
"HBV was detected concurrently with another respiratory virus in 34.6% of cases, and underlying diseases, asthma, or previous bronchiolitis episodes were observed in 61.5% of hBV-infected children, suggesting possible facilitation of hBV pathogenicity by predisposing conditions.",PMC3291226,PMC3291226_3
"The study found only minor sequence variations in the vp2 gene of hBV, indicating limited genetic diversity among diverse strains of hBV.",PMC3291226,PMC3291226_4
