"Intradermal electroporation results in rapid induction of apoptotic and necrotic cell death events in the skin, with apoptosis detected as early as one hour after treatment and necrosis peaking at two hours.",PMC6421993,PMC6421993_0
"Infiltration of immune cells into the area surrounding the treatment site is observed at four hours after treatment, with peak propidium iodide staining detected at six hours.",PMC6421993,PMC6421993_1
Intradermal electroporation delivery results in upregulation of the phagocyte “eat me” signal of calreticulin in the skin at four hours after treatment.,PMC6421993,PMC6421993_2
"High intradermal electroporation voltages lead to a larger e-field and permit a larger area of tissue to be transfected, but voltages that are too high may cause increased levels of cell death and negatively impact gene expression levels and immune responses.",PMC6421993,PMC6421993_3
Understanding the inflammatory mechanisms induced by intradermal electroporation delivery of gene-based therapeutics will enhance our ability to further tailor electroporation-based delivery protocols to drive the gene expression levels and immune responses desired.,PMC6421993,PMC6421993_4
