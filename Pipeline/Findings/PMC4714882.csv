"The study conducted in a Taiwanese breeding herd found that the porcine epidemic diarrhea (PEDV) virus infection significantly affected the reproductive and growth performance of gilts and sows, resulting in prolonged neonatal diarrhea, high mortality rates in neonatal piglets, and poorer performance of surviving pigs.",PMC4714882,PMC4714882_0
"The study revealed that the influence of PEDV on neonatal diarrhea and mortality was more severe in infected herds with high suckling mortality, and that the lactation period was extended due to the incomplete uterine involution and tissue repair in early-weaned sows.",PMC4714882,PMC4714882_1
"The study also found that the impact of PEDV on neonatal diarrhea and mortality led to a significant increase in abortion rates, as well as a decrease in farrowing rates and an increase in weaning-to-first service intervals, resulting in a prolongation of non-productive days and a decrease in the number of pigs weaned per reproductive lifetime.",PMC4714882,PMC4714882_2
"The study highlighted that the impact of PEDV on neonatal diarrhea and mortality also impaired the productivity indices in gilts and sows, as evidenced by the increase in weaning-to-first service intervals, the decrease in the number of pigs born alive per mating, and the prolongation of non-productive days in primiparous sows.",PMC4714882,PMC4714882_3
"The study suggested that the control and improvement of the impact of PEDV on neonatal diarrhea and mortality may alter the management of females, including the reduction in abortion rates, the decrease in lactation length, the decrease in the percentage of gilts in the breeding-female inventory, and the increase in the percentage of multiple matings.",PMC4714882,PMC4714882_4
