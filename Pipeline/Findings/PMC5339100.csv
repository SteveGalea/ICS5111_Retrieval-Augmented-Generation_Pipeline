The laboratory-developed respiratory viral panel (RVP) is a capillary electrophoresis-based multiplex RT-PCR assay for detecting 16 respiratory viral pathogens.,PMC5339100,PMC5339100_0
"The RVP is composed of four separate multiplex reactions, each targeting specific viruses.",PMC5339100,PMC5339100_1
The analytical sensitivity of the RVP is 20 copies/PCR for all viruses.,PMC5339100,PMC5339100_2
"Clinical specificity and sensitivity of the RVP were evaluated using 65 archived, pre-tested clinical samples, with 100% result concordance compared to single-plex (RT-)PCRs.",PMC5339100,PMC5339100_3
"The RVP can simultaneously detect influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1-4, enterovirus and rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, metapneumovirus, coronaviruses (OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1), and adenovirus.",PMC5339100,PMC5339100_4
