"The study identified a type II transmembrane serine protease, tmprss2, as a critical factor in enhancing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) entry into human cells. Tmprss2 is a member of the hepsin/tmprss subfamily and is known to cleave other viral and cellular proteins.",PMC3020023,PMC3020023_0
"Tmprss2 cleaves the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein, a process that is required for efficient viral entry into cells. Tmprss2-mediated activation of S is achieved by at least two divergent proteases, as the study found that S is shed by both tmprss2 and tACE, an unrelated protease known to cleave SARS-CoV S.",PMC3020023,PMC3020023_1
"ACE2, the SARS-CoV receptor, is cleaved by tmprss2, which is consistent with the finding that tmprss2 and ace2 colocalize in cells. The study also found that tmprss2 degraded ace2, making it challenging to microscopically identify cells in which both of these proteins were present. However, when rare ace2+ tmprss2+ cells were found, clear colocalizations were immediately evident.",PMC3020023,PMC3020023_2
"The study found that tmprss2 does not influence SARS-CoV-mediated entry into adjacent ace2+ cells, despite the fact that wild-type tmprss2, but not the inactive zymogen, coprecipitated ace2. The study also found that tmprss2 did not digest ace2 when the two membrane proteins were expressed in adjacent cells. Therefore, the study suggests that the cells most susceptible to SARS-CoV infection are those in which ace2 and tmprss2 are simultaneously present and that tmprss2-mediated activation of S occurs in cis, rather than in trans.",PMC3020023,PMC3020023_3
"The study also found that the SARS-CoV spike is activated by tmprss2 during or after exocytic transport in cells, analogous to influenza virus ha0 activation and numerous furin-cleaved viral glycoproteins. The study suggests that tmprss2 provides a certain ""immediacy"" of S activation that can",PMC3020023,PMC3020023_4
