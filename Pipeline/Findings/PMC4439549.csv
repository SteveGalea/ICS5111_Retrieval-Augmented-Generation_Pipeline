"The study conducted in two regions in Africa, specifically côte d'ivoire and the Democratic Republic of Congo, found seroprevalence rates of hantavirus antibodies of 3.9% and 2.4%, respectively. This is significantly higher than the rates previously reported in Guinea and South Africa.",PMC4439549,PMC4439549_0
"The study found that people living in tropical forest regions in these areas, specifically côte d'ivoire, have a relatively higher exposure to hantaviruses compared to populations in other areas.",PMC4439549,PMC4439549_1
"The study revealed that about 97% of people above the age of 16 years participating in the study reported consuming rodents and other small mammals, which is a risk factor for hantavirus infection.",PMC4439549,PMC4439549_2
"The study found that among the study group, many participants reported a large variety of recent health problems, but no serious health problems typical for hantavirus disease with severe course were mentioned.",PMC4439549,PMC4439549_3
"The study found that the use of antigens from african sangassou, puumala, and dobrava-belgrade viruses in the screening increased the chance of detecting hantavirus antibodies directed against still uncharacterized, indigenous viruses in the region, but the relatively low number of samples positive in all confirmatory assays makes calculations statistically difficult.",PMC4439549,PMC4439549_4
