This study is the first to compare adenoid and middle ear microbiota in both ome children and healthy controls using a sensitive method to detect a comprehensive panel of respiratory viruses and bacteria.,PMC5322954,PMC5322954_0
"The detection rate of bacteria in the middle ear was significantly higher in patients with ome than in controls, while the higher overall frequency of bacteria detection in mews from ome patients was expected due to the accumulation of middle ear effusion suctioning microbial components of the nasopharyngeal microbiota.",PMC5322954,PMC5322954_1
"The detection of adenovirus was more frequent in hypertrophic adenoid tissues from patients with ome than in normal adenoids from healthy controls, but it is not clear whether adenovirus has any role in pathogenesis of adenoid hypertrophy.",PMC5322954,PMC5322954_2
"Simultaneous detection of hadv and s. Pneumoniae in adenoid tissue could be acting in concert to modify the course of ome due to interactions between viruses and bacteria on different mucosal surfaces, including the upper respiratory tract mucosa and tonsils.",PMC5322954,PMC5322954_3
"The findings suggest that microbial correlations already described in acute middle ear disease could play a role in such chronic processes, and the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the middle ear of patients undergoing cochlear implant is independent of biofilm formation.",PMC5322954,PMC5322954_4
"This study adds evidence that microbial community present in the middle ear may be associated with persistence of fluid and pathogenesis of ome due to higher detection rates of potentially pathogenic bacteria, but not respiratory viruses, by real-time PCR in middle ear samples as compared to control patients without adenoid hypertrophy.",PMC5322954,PMC5322954_5
"The study did not observe correlation between the microbiota of adenoid and middle ear, neither in ome children nor in controls.",PMC5322954,PMC5322954_6
"The findings suggest that microbial community present in the middle ear may be associated with persistence of fluid and pathogenesis of ome due to the observed association of detection of hadv and s. Pneumoniae in adenoid tissues from patients with ome, which could be acting in concert to modify the course of ome due to interactions between viruses and bacteria on different mucosal surfaces, including the upper respiratory tract m",PMC5322954,PMC5322954_7
