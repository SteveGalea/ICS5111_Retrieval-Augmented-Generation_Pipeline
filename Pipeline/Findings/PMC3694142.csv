"In a study investigating the potential of using recombinant adenovirus (rabv), vaccinia (vsv), and nanoparticle-delivered simian virus 40 (ndv) as vaccines against HIV-1 gag, it was found that heterologous combinations of these vectors were able to enhance immune responses primed by each other. This suggests that a vaccine regimen with rabv-gag prime, ndv-gag boost #1, and vsv-gag boost #2 would be a strong candidate for further study in mice and macaques, with the addition of envelope proteins to stimulate humoral responses.",PMC3694142,PMC3694142_0
"The study also showed that ndv-gag and vsv-gag elicited the strongest post-boost immune responses, likely due to the induction of type I interferon responses, while vsv-gag primed mice had the highest responses post-challenge.",PMC3694142,PMC3694142_1
"The functional profile of the cells induced in the immune responses was determined by analyzing the expression and co-expression of IFN-γ and TNF-α, which was proportional to the magnitude of the immune response induced post-boost.",PMC3694142,PMC3694142_2
"The study also found that ndv-gag was able to efficiently boost gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses after rabv-gag priming, but vsv-gag failed to do so, suggesting differences in the pattern of cytokine induction.",PMC3694142,PMC3694142_3
"The challenge studies in mice with more emphasis on the function of CD8+ T cells showed that all prime-boost regimens generated significant recall responses compared to naive controls, with mice that had been boosted with ndv-gag having a lower CD8+ T cell response compared to rabv-gag and vsv-gag boosted mice.",PMC3694142,PMC3694142_4
