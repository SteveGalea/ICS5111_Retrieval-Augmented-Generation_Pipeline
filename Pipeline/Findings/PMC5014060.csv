"The study found that estimates of the basic reproduction number, r0, based on ignoring contact structure in actual social structures tend to result in a slight overestimation in epidemics on empirical networks. This is consistent with observations made in previous studies on epidemics in actual social structures and on empirical networks.",PMC5014060,PMC5014060_0
The study also found that estimates of r0 based on homogeneous mixing assumption tend to be larger than estimates based on who infected whom in the real infection process in epidemics on empirical networks. This is explained by the relatively small average number of acquaintances per individual and the structure of small groups in which all individuals are acquaintances with all other individuals in the group in some actual social structures.,PMC5014060,PMC5014060_1
The study further found that estimates of r0 based on homogeneous mixing assumption tend to be less than 90% of estimates based on who infected whom in epidemics on empirical networks. This is consistent with observations made in previous studies on epidemics on empirical networks.,PMC5014060,PMC5014060_2
Half of the estimates of r0 based on the epidemic growth rate and the homogeneous mixing assumption are between 12% and 45% larger than the estimate based on who infected whom in epidemics on empirical networks.,PMC5014060,PMC5014060_3
The difference in estimates of r0 based on the epidemic growth rate and the homogeneous mixing assumption tends to be less than 21 in some empirical networks. This is consistent with observations made in previous studies on epidemics on empirical networks.,PMC5014060,PMC5014060_4
"The study also found that if the infection rate is increasing, the overestimation factor also shows an increasing trend in epidemics on empirical networks. This is consistent with observations made in previous studies on epidemics on actual social structures and on empirical networks.",PMC5014060,PMC5014060_5
"The study further found that in some epidemics on empirical networks, the majority of estimates of r0 based on the epidemic growth rate and the homogeneous mixing assumption are between 12% and 45% larger than the estimate based on who infected whom.",PMC5014060,PMC5014060_6
