"In a study on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by the coronavirus, 29 analyzed SARS sequences from 20 individual SARS patients showed a higher variation frequency in the S gene compared to previous reports. Variations were detected in four participants, suggesting the possible existence of SARS-CoV quasispecies in acute infection.",PMC3323231,PMC3323231_0
"The study also identified some new variant sites in the S gene, including a nonsynonymous change observed at position a1023g within the heptad repeat (HR) domains, which are important for virus entry. However, the limitation of clinical sample collection and difficulty in directly amplifying full-length S genes from raw clinical samples restricted further extensive study for dynamic mutant distributions of the virus.",PMC3323231,PMC3323231_1
"The study observed the coexistence of SARS-CoV sequences with and without substitutions and time-dependent variation profiles in some patients. This suggests that the genetic variation of SARS-CoV remains limited in relation to many other RNA viruses such as HIV-1, HCV, and MHV, possibly preventing persistent long-term mutant development in vivo as occurs in chronic RNA viral infections.",PMC3323231,PMC3323231_2
"The study also reported that some modules in the S protein remain conserved, e.g., the fusion-important HR domains. Although some variations were detected, no obvious correlation exists between mutation and clinical disease manifestation from the limited data reported here.",PMC3323231,PMC3323231_3
"The study noted that the genetic variation of SARS-CoV remains limited in relation to many other RNA viruses such as HIV-1, HCV, and MHV. The probable reason is that SARS-CoV only causes an acute, self-limited infection, which may prevent persistent long-term mutant development in vivo as occurs in chronic RNA viral infections.",PMC3323231,PMC3323231_4
