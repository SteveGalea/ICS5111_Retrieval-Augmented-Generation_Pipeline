The study identified 116 early-response genes and 64 late-response genes in the brains of mice infected with the coronavirus MHV.,PMC2728740,PMC2728740_0
"The expression of 82 genes was found to be upregulated (≥ 1.5-fold) in the brains of MHV-infected mice, but not significantly changed in MHV-infected type I IFN receptor knockout mice.",PMC2728740,PMC2728740_1
Functional association network analysis revealed a central role for interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and IRF7 in the network.,PMC2728740,PMC2728740_2
"The study also found that the expression of a subset of 57 genes was differentially expressed in the brains of MHV-infected mice compared to PBS-inoculated mice, and the expression of these genes correlated with viral load.",PMC2728740,PMC2728740_3
"Differential gene expression in the brains of MHV-infected type I IFN receptor knockout mice was also analyzed, revealing a list of 82 genes with upregulated expression (≥ 1.5-fold) in the MHV-infected mice but not significantly changed in the IFN receptor knockout mice.",PMC2728740,PMC2728740_4
