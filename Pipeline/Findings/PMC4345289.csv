"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat, with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) being major public health challenges.",PMC4345289,PMC4345289_0
"AMR in healthcare settings is related to the excessive use of antimicrobials in animals, food and agriculture, as well as the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in humans and the environment.",PMC4345289,PMC4345289_1
"In Hong Kong and Mainland China, AMR in animals and food is a major concern, with AMR in food being the most common source of AMR infections in humans.",PMC4345289,PMC4345289_2
"To address AMR in healthcare settings, a combination of proactive ""added testing"" for emerging MRSA, directly observed hand hygiene, and ""entry and exit"" control strategy are important additional measures, along with interventions in healthcare settings that are regionally coordinated where patients, staff, and visitors are often transferred between acute hospital service, convalescent hospital, and elderly residential homes.",PMC4345289,PMC4345289_3
"Data of hand hygiene compliance, broad-spectrum antibiotic consumption, and incidence of newly diagnosed and hospital-acquired MRSA should be regularly released to the public so that the performance of individual hospitals is subject to auditing by the public from time to time.",PMC4345289,PMC4345289_4
