The allelic model of ABCB1 rs1045642 shows a protective effect against sonfh at a very low level of evidence.,PMC6287043,PMC6287043_0
The mutations in APOB rs693 and rs1042031 increase the sonfh risk with moderate levels of evidence.,PMC6287043,PMC6287043_1
A gene set enrichment analysis based on overrepresentation enrichment analysis reveals that only the molecular functions of ABCB1 and APOB show obvious relationships with lipid transporter activity (GO: 0005319).,PMC6287043,PMC6287043_2
"The increase of circulating LDL induced by mutation increases the risk of sonfh, supporting the hypothesis that lipid metabolism disorders are associated with sonfh.",PMC6287043,PMC6287043_3
"The location subgroup analysis of rs1042031 results shows a significant decrease in heterogeneity, and the population is concentrated in Guangxi and Shandong in China.",PMC6287043,PMC6287043_4
