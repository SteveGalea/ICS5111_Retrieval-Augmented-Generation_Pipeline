"In the context of emerging infectious diseases, rapid collection of epidemiological data is crucial from the onset of the event. Traditional methods of constructing questionnaires for each event result in delayed epidemiological responses that impede understanding and control of the event.",PMC3816197,PMC3816197_0
"The software tool ""epibasket"" addresses this issue by adapting e-commerce concepts to enable rapid collection of standardized data after an outbreak or environmental disaster. It enables epidemiologists to choose appropriate questions from a catalogue based on relevant variables identified through a literature review.",PMC3816197,PMC3816197_1
"The software facilitates better standardization of questionnaires by assigning a ""value"" to each question based on its use in published papers, with a higher value assigned to questions published in high-profile journals.",PMC3816197,PMC3816197_2
"In the context of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) surveys, which are frequently explored during or after outbreaks or environmental disasters, epibasket provides a proof-of-concept prototype. It enables epidemiologists to tailor questionnaires by choosing appropriate questions from a catalogue and provides online questionnaires and ready-to-use forms.",PMC3816197,PMC3816197_3
"The software facilitates merging of databases constructed with responses to different questionnaires by enabling compatibility among questionnaires. Each question is associated with keywords, related questions, and information on the population studied and the time of study. This maximizes the likelihood of compatibility among questionnaires and allows for identification of relevant questions for a particular study.",PMC3816197,PMC3816197_4
