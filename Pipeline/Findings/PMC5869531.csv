"In the section discussing the two-stage model of viral assembly, the authors present evidence from studies on bacteriophage MS2, plant virus satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and members of the picornaviridae, suggesting that multiple discrete packing sequences (PPS) exist on the genomes of viruses and serve as binding sites for capsid proteins (CP) of the virus. This model proposes that stage 1 refers to the collapse of the RNA into a condensed form, followed by the addition of further CP molecules in stage 2. This model suggests that multiple PPS dispersed throughout the genome define the incorporation of CP and the eventual assembly of the particle, unlike in alphaviruses, where no such lattice of RNA density has been identified in reconstructed capsid structures or whole virus particles.",PMC5869531,PMC5869531_0
"In the section discussing the assembly of alphavirus nucleocapsid (NCS), the authors present evidence suggesting that alphavirus NCS may assemble through an alternative mechanism, which may involve specific RNA sequences making contacts with the n-terminal domain of the CP, followed by electrostatically driven assembly. However, they also mention that traditional approaches have identified some viruses with singular RNA secondary structures, described as a PPS, which are able to nucleate CP. This initates an electrostatically driven assembly process, but many viruses do not conform to this model, as a single PPS could not be identified.",PMC5869531,PMC5869531_1
"In the same section, the authors mention that traditional approaches have also identified specific CP-RNA interactions generated during assembly or upon disassembly that alter the kinetics of viral growth in a subsequent cell, as suggested by Sokolowski et al. (2017).",PMC5869531,PMC5869531_2
"In the section discussing the assembly of alphavirus nucleocapsid (NCS), the authors also mention that further questions about alphavirus assembly include determining how the CP or genome RNA traffics to sites of assembly and investigating the role of the CP upon entry into new cells.",PMC5869531,PMC5869531_3
"In the same section, the authors mention that the current evidence suggests that spherules begin biogenesis at the plasma membrane (PM) and then become CP-containing NCS, but the question of how the NCS forms is a",PMC5869531,PMC5869531_4
