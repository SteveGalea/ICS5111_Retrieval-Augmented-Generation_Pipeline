"The ace2/ang-(1–7)/mas signaling pathway in the brain is involved in the regulation of blood pressure, sympathetic outflow, and cardiovascular functions.",PMC3075080,PMC3075080_0
"Ang-(1–7) activation of the mas receptor leads to the inhibition of angiotensin II-mediated effects, such as vasoconstriction, aldosterone secretion, and thirst, through the activation of a reciprocal inhibition between the two ras axes.",PMC3075080,PMC3075080_1
"The mas receptor is involved in the regulation of learning and memory, as its deficiency in mice leads to impairments in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks and synaptic plasticity.",PMC3075080,PMC3075080_2
"Ang-(1–7) stimulation promotes endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation and upregulation, which can preserve endothelial function and reduce oxidative stress in human endothelial cells.",PMC3075080,PMC3075080_3
"The nontraditional components of the ras, such as aminopeptidase A and prorenin receptor, play critical roles upstream and downstream of angiotensin II, and their inhibition or blockade can lead to beneficial effects in the treatment of cardiovascular and other pathologies.",PMC3075080,PMC3075080_4
