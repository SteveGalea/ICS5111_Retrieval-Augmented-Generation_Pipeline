"The study found that the human rotavirus, tgev, has a second binding activity in addition to binding to the primary receptor, aminopeptidase n. This second binding activity is mediated by a sialic acid binding activity.",PMC136196,PMC136196_0
"The study demonstrated that the sialic acid binding activity of tgev is required for efficient virus replication in the intestinal epithelium, as mutants lacking this activity have lost their enteropathogenicity.",PMC136196,PMC136196_1
"The study found that the binding of tgev to sialoglycoproteins increases the amount of bound virus, but it does not increase infectivity.",PMC136196,PMC136196_2
The study found that the presence of a sialic acid binding activity in tgev may help the virus get access to the target cells in the intestine by allowing it to stay longer in the intestine and make it easier to find the aminopeptidase n receptor for initiating infection.,PMC136196,PMC136196_3
"The study found that the resistance of tgev to inactivation by detergent was only slightly increased compared to that of mutants lacking sialic acid binding activity, suggesting that the importance of this binding activity may be to help the virus get access to the target cells rather than to protect it from inactivation by low ph and protease.",PMC136196,PMC136196_4
