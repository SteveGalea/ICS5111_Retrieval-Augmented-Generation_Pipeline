"In this study, 3 proteins (alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (agp), apolipoprotein-a1 (apo-a1), and apolipoprotein-a1 precursor (pre apo-a1)) were identified as potential biomarkers for feline pancreatic disease using proteomic analysis of plasma protein profiles.",PMC4445510,PMC4445510_0
"Higher agp concentrations tended to be found in cats with pancreatic disease, although there was considerable overlap among cats with pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma, and healthy controls.",PMC4445510,PMC4445510_1
"Apolipoprotein-a1 (apo-a1) appeared lower in cats with pancreatic disease, although this difference was not statistically significant due to the low sample size.",PMC4445510,PMC4445510_2
"Pre apolipoprotein-a1 (pre apo-a1) appeared higher in cats with pancreatic disease, and the mean pre apo-a1 spot volume was significantly higher in cats with pancreatic carcinoma than in healthy controls.",PMC4445510,PMC4445510_3
The study suggests possible alteration of lipid metabolism associated with feline pancreatic disease in relation to shifts in apo-a1 and pre apo-a1.,PMC4445510,PMC4445510_4
