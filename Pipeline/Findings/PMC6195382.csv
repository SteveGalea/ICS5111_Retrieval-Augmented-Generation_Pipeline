"In a study examining the effect of anti-ceacam1 treatment on tumor growth, mice were inoculated with 1 × 106 cells of the ct26 tumor model, and vehicle controls received mouse IgG1 antibody and vehicle. The dose of anti-ceacam1 was 30 mg/kg, given intraperitoneally, every other day. The study also included a bladder cancer model, mbt2, and a B cell lymphoma model, a20. The study found that anti-ceacam1 treatment, alone or in combination with a surrogate anti-mouse PD1 mAb, significantly reduced tumor growth.",PMC6195382,PMC6195382_0
"In another study, the effect of anti-ceacam1 treatment on tumor-initiating cells was examined in a mouse colon cancer model, ct26. The study found that anti-ceacam1 treatment, alone or in combination with a surrogate anti-mouse PD1 mAb, significantly reduced the number of tumor-initiating cells.",PMC6195382,PMC6195382_1
"In a study investigating the effect of cc1 on tumor growth in syngeneic mouse models, mice were inoculated with 1 × 106 cells of the ct26 tumor model, and the dose of cc1 was 10 or 30 mg/kg, given intraperitoneally, every other day. The study also included a bladder cancer model, mbt2, and a B cell lymphoma model, a20. The study found that increasing doses of cc1 significantly reduced tumor growth.",PMC6195382,PMC6195382_2
