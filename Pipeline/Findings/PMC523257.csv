"DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR enhance filovirus and sars-cov infection through lectin engagement, with marv Gp and s-bearing pseudotypes showing 35-65 and 30-fold increases in infectious entry, respectively.",PMC523257,PMC523257_0
"Engagement of DC-SIGN by sars-cov S glycoprotein is specifically blocked by the carbohydrate mannan, indicating that DC-SIGN facilitates sars-cov transmission to susceptible cells.",PMC523257,PMC523257_1
"DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR do not function as receptors for sars-cov, but they can promote sars-cov infection of already-permissive cells.",PMC523257,PMC523257_2
"DC-SIGN-expressing dendritic cells (DCs) are not permissive to sars-cov infection but can transmit sars-cov to susceptible cells, and only 50% of DC-mediated viral transfer is inhibited by mannan, suggesting that factors other than DC-SIGN or related lectins contribute to transmission.",PMC523257,PMC523257_3
"DC-SIGN-expressing alveolar macrophages could capture and transmit virus to susceptible cells, such as type II pneumocytes, which might promote local infection during sars-cov infection.",PMC523257,PMC523257_4
