"The electron cryo-microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction of the truncated p22 portal and the p22 tail machine showed a preference for orientation in ice. This allowed for the creation of a preliminary reconstruction, which gave rise to an elongated needle-like density for the originally spherical one, validating the reconstruction.",PMC1150889,PMC1150889_0
"The defoci of these micrographs ranged from 1.4 to 3.7 μm, and the contrast transfer function was corrected by phase flipping.",PMC1150889,PMC1150889_1
"The resolution of the final reconstruction was estimated to be 8 Å, where the fourier shell correlation dropped to 0.5 at 1/23 Å−1, 0.4 at 1/22 Å−1, and 0.3 at 1/16 Å−1.",PMC1150889,PMC1150889_2
"The map revealed the crown, wing, and stalk domains with a central channel. The handedness of the map was determined assuming that the orientation of the stalk domain of the portal monomer is similar to that in the portal complex of bacteriophage phi29 whose atomic structures are available.",PMC1150889,PMC1150889_3
"The small spherical density was placed next to the bottom opening of the portal, and the connection between the crown and wing domains was clearly defined in the map. The subunit boundary at the stalk region was also distinguished in the map.",PMC1150889,PMC1150889_4
