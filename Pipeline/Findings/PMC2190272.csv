"A systematic review of available research has found that simple public health measures, such as frequent handwashing, barrier measures, and isolation of people with suspected respiratory tract infections, are highly effective at reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses, especially when they are part of a structured program including instruction and education.",PMC2190272,PMC2190272_0
"The review suggests that physical barriers, such as handwashing, masks, and gloves, are effective in preventing the spread of respiratory virus infections, and that these interventions should be better evaluated and given higher priority in preparation for pandemics.",PMC2190272,PMC2190272_1
"The review identifies that compliance with interventions, especially educational programs, is a problem for several studies, despite the importance of such low-cost interventions.",PMC2190272,PMC2190272_2
"The review highlights that routine long-term implementation of some interventions, especially maintaining strict hygiene and barrier routines for long periods, may be problematic, particularly in highly motivated environments such as hospitals without the threat of an epidemic.",PMC2190272,PMC2190272_3
