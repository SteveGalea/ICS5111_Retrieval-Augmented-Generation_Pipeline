"The STAT3 family of proteins, also known as signal transducers and activators of transcription, play a crucial role in regulating the immune response, inflammation, cell proliferation, and differentiation, as well as in mediating host defense against virus infections.",PMC4496485,PMC4496485_0
STAT3 is constitutively activated in neoplastic cells and many viruses exploit the oncogenic effects of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) to promote cell transformation and tumorigenesis.,PMC4496485,PMC4496485_1
"STAT3 is involved in the regulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, either through transcriptional regulation of other cellular factors or through pathways independent of its role as a transcription factor.",PMC4496485,PMC4496485_2
"In viral infections, STAT3 plays a significant role in the interplay between viruses and their hosts and functions as either a pro- or antiviral factor depending on the virus and host cell type involved.",PMC4496485,PMC4496485_3
"The seemingly contradictory roles of STAT3 in viral infections raise questions about what factors determine the switch between pro- and anti-inflammatory functions of STAT3, how viruses exploit STAT3 signalling for their gene replication, and whether STAT3 negatively or positively regulates type 1 interferon response depending on the virus type involved.",PMC4496485,PMC4496485_4
