"The study identified a novel variant of the deformed wing virus (DWV) in honeybees, which they named type C. This variant is distinct from the previously known variants, type A and B, and it forms a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree.",PMC5029213,PMC5029213_0
"The analysis suggests that type C has not recently emerged but rather is an established DWV variant. This finding is supported by the presence of type C in honeybees from Hawaii, which have not been colonized by the parasitic mite Varroa.",PMC5029213,PMC5029213_1
"The study also confirmed the observation made in other bee species that DWV is a ""generalist"" virus that can infect different insects. However, it remains unclear whether type C causes acute wing deformities in honeybees or if its presence is because of viral ""spillover"" from another host.",PMC5029213,PMC5029213_2
"The study found that DWV exists as a swarm of recombining variants and occupies large amounts of sequence space, which may be one of the factors contributing to its capability to maintain a persistent infection. Defining DWV as a quasispecies with at least three master variants that can recombine with each other would be a more progressive classification of the DWV quasispecies.",PMC5029213,PMC5029213_3
"The study also suggests that DWV is able to replicate in honeybees, as the large number of DWV type C and A-C recombinant reads in the samples indicate. Further direct manipulation experiments, such as those carried out by Ryabov et al. (2014), could be crucial in determining whether the novel type C genome and any of its recombinants are hypervirulent.",PMC5029213,PMC5029213_4
