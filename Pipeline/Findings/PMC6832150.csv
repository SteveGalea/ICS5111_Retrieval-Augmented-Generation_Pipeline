The study utilized a closed colony of spf cats with endemic serotype i fcv to characterize immune responses associated with virus control.,PMC6832150,PMC6832150_0
"The study observed no abnormalities in serum chemistry profile or complete blood count (CBC) of group 3 cats, which confirmed the overall picture of a relatively benign enteric viral infection despite astounding levels of virus replication.",PMC6832150,PMC6832150_1
"The study measured constitutive and fcv-specific interferon gamma (IFNγ) production and observed no differences between groups, suggesting cellular sources of IFNγ including NK cells, NKT cells, and T cells were not over-represented in the colonic mucosa of fcv-shedding cats.",PMC6832150,PMC6832150_2
"The study characterized the mucosal humoral and cellular response to fcv and suggested that mucosal IgA and systemic IgG responses are necessary for virus control, given the lack of demonstrable cell-mediated immune responses.",PMC6832150,PMC6832150_3
The study characterized the viral targets and the antibody effector functions needed for successful vaccination against fcv and suggested that significant additional work is required to characterize the viral targets and the antibody effector functions needed for successful vaccination against fcv.,PMC6832150,PMC6832150_4
