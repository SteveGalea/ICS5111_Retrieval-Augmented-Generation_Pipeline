"The authors have identified 105 new viral variants belonging to the proposed ""sapelovirus"" genus, as well as 20 new variants belonging to the currently unclassified viruses dhv, svv, and sepv-1.",PMC2629322,PMC2629322_0
The authors found that the picornavirus sequences for phylogenetic analysis were aligned from 2 or more representative serotypes from each species within each of the 9 currently classified genera of picornaviruses.,PMC2629322,PMC2629322_1
"The authors determined sequence divergences between cosaviruses and those of other picornaviruses using sliding window analysis and phylogenetic analyses, with a window size of 100 codons, incrementing by 4 codons per data point, in the picornavirus sequences belonging to the proposed ""sapelovirus"" genus and the currently unclassified viruses dhv, svv, and sepv-1.",PMC2629322,PMC2629322_2
"The authors identified that 5 out of 8 hcosv variants were more conserved in rna secondary structure, while the remaining 3 out of 8 hcosv variants were more diverse, with mean pairwise distances 79-83%.",PMC2629322,PMC2629322_3
The authors determined mean folding energies of fragments of the hcosv-a1 genome and control sequences using the program zipfold with default settings as described.,PMC2629322,PMC2629322_4
