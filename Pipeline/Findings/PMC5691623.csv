"The study identified a novel class of small molecules, BH3 inhibitors, that selectively induce apoptosis in virus-infected cells without affecting non-infected cells.",PMC5691623,PMC5691623_0
"These molecules, including abt-263, facilitate apoptosis in virus-infected cells at physiologically relevant concentrations, without causing toxicity to non-infected cells.",PMC5691623,PMC5691623_1
"The study showed that abt-263, abt-737, abt-199, wehi-539, a-1331852, and a-1155463 specifically induced apoptosis in iav-infected cells, and only abt-263, abt-737, a-1331852, and a-1155463 limited viral replication.",PMC5691623,PMC5691623_2
"The study demonstrated that abt-263-sensitized apoptosis was dependent on the load of viral nucleic acids, and abt-263 treatment could prematurely terminate viral replication, either during the early stages of a viral infection if the viral load was high, or during the late stages of a viral infection if the initial concentration of viral nucleic acid was low.",PMC5691623,PMC5691623_3
"The study suggested that a-1155463, or its derivatives, may be a lead pro-apoptotic compound with antiviral properties, as it caused reversible thrombocytopenia, which made it a suitable antiviral lead candidate. However, its antiviral efficacy should be evaluated in vivo, and its side effects, including its immuno- and neuro-modulatory properties, should be studied in detail.",PMC5691623,PMC5691623_4
