"One promising candidate for hev drug development is silvestrol, a natural compound found in marigold flowers. It has been shown to effectively inhibit hev replication in vitro cell culture systems and has an additive effect with the antiviral drug ribavirin in vivo studies. Silvestrol also targets the viral polymerase, which is a promising target for direct acting antivirals (daas) due to its high specificity and potential to enhance efficacy and cure rates, as demonstrated in the case of hepatitis C virus (HCV).",PMC6631701,PMC6631701_0
"Another promising target for hev drug development is the viral protease, which is also a direct acting antiviral (daa) target. The structure of the hev protease has been determined, but until its exact function and borders of each functional domain are understood, studies to identify antivirals based on structural insights seem at best unlikely.",PMC6631701,PMC6631701_1
"The de novo development of candidate structures into a potential licensed drug is only a future perspective for hev drug development, as there are currently no anti-hev candidates in clinical trials. However, the use of repurposed drugs, such as sofosbuvir and pegifn-Î±, which are approved for use in experimental settings beyond in vitro cell culture systems, may provide a quicker pathway to clinical trials.",PMC6631701,PMC6631701_2
"The use of host factors in drug discovery for hev is another promising approach. The identification of novel host factors through -omics approaches and functional studies using cdna, shrna, and sirna libraries can refine in vitro and in vivo models and provide new starting points for drug discovery.",PMC6631701,PMC6631701_3
"The current state of research on hev drug development highlights the need for more specific agents targeting viral enzymes, such as the polymerase and protease, as direct acting antivirals (daas). The structure-guided design of potent inhibitors by fitting the compound and the viral enzyme to complementary surfaces is a promising strategy for drug discovery. However, until the exact function and borders of each functional domain of the polyprotein are understood, studies based on structural insights seem at best unlikely.",PMC6631701,PMC6631701_4
