"In a study investigating the safety and efficacy of using spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) as an animal feed ingredient, researchers found that SDPP is a safe protein ingredient that does not transmit porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), two of the more thermal and solvent resistant known viruses.",PMC4501813,PMC4501813_0
"However, as microbes evolve and new pathogens are discovered, it is prudent to evaluate additional technology that may further minimize risks associated with feeding biological products to animals intended for human consumption.",PMC4501813,PMC4501813_1
"In a feeding experiment, the researchers found that dietary SDPP improved pig performance compared to pigs fed the control diet without SDPP, and that UVC-irradiated SDPP tended to enhance performance in general over control SDPP.",PMC4501813,PMC4501813_2
The researchers also observed a tendency of improved pig performance during the first 14 days and better performance over the whole period when pigs were fed diets with UVC-irradiated SDPP compared with non UVC-irradiated SDPP diets.,PMC4501813,PMC4501813_3
"The results obtained in the UVC-irradiated SDPP study suggest that the microbiological quality of UVC-treated SDPP was improved, and that UVC irradiation had no negative effect on animal performance.",PMC4501813,PMC4501813_4
