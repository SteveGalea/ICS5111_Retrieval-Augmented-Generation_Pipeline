The study found that (-)-α-pinene and (-)-β-pinene have anti-ibv activity by inhibiting the binding process between RNA and the ibv n protein.,PMC6259611,PMC6259611_0
Cytotoxicity assays showed that the maximal non-toxic concentration of (-)-α-pinene and (-)-β-pinene on Vero-E6 cells is 0.005 mm.,PMC6259611,PMC6259611_1
"The study identified that the interaction energies of (-)-α-pinene and (-)-β-pinene with the n-terminal domain of n-protein are mainly stabilized by van der Waals forces, and the maximal binding difference is in the range of 0.005 to 0.001 mm.",PMC6259611,PMC6259611_2
"Flexible docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the interaction energies of the compounds with n-terminal domain of n-protein at the n-protein active site are mainly van der Waals forces, and the interaction energies of (-)-α-pinene and (-)-β-pinene with the respective residues at the n-protein active site are calculated by the docking module over the 1,000 to 5,000 ps MD trajectories.",PMC6259611,PMC6259611_3
