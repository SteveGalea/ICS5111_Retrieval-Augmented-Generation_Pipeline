"The study found that the seroprevalence rates for enterovirus 71 (ev71) and coxsackie virus A16 (ca16) in healthy adults in China were high, with rates of 85.7% and 58.8%, respectively.",PMC4051363,PMC4051363_0
"The study also found that while infection rates for these viruses in children older than 5 years reached saturation levels, there was no significant difference in seroprevalence rates between coastal and inland areas, or between genders or age groups.",PMC4051363,PMC4051363_1
"The study noted that the correlation between neutralizing antibody titers for ev71, ca16, and adenovirus type 5 (adhu5) implies that enterovirus cocirculates with human adenovirus in humans, and that adenovirus infection should also be taken into consideration in the prevention and treatment of human fever with unknown causes (hfmd).",PMC4051363,PMC4051363_2
"The study found that while adenovirus type 5 (adhu5) seroprevalence rates in adults varied from 60% to 70% in Europe and the US, the seroprevalence rate in adults in China was significantly higher in coastal regions than in inland regions.",PMC4051363,PMC4051363_3
"The study suggested that adenovirus type 5 (adhu5) and coxsackie virus A16 (ca16) were highly epidemic among healthy adults in China, and the adenovirus type 5 (adhu5) seroprevalence rate was low (11.8%) and similar to that for another rare serotype, adenovirus type 68 (adc68), from chimpanzees, in Chinese adults.",PMC4051363,PMC4051363_4
