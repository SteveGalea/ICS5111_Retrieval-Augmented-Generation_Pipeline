"Virus stability: The study found that the stability of vsv-i, v920, and rvsv-sfv in mosquitoes remained within 2-fold of the desired titer for up to 14 days post-infection in both mosquito species, indicating good stability of the viruses in the mosquitoes.",PMC5893201,PMC5893201_0
Vaccine stability: The study also confirmed the stability of the virus in the infectious blood meal used to assess virus infection and dissemination in each mosquito species following oral exposure through an infectious blood meal.,PMC5893201,PMC5893201_1
"Growth curves: Growth curves of all viruses were assessed in cell culture, and back-titrations of each infectious blood meal were performed on vero cells to confirm virus titers in the infectious blood meal.",PMC5893201,PMC5893201_2
"Intrathoracic inoculations: Groups of at least 50 cx. Quinquefasciatus and ae. Aegypti mosquitoes were it inoculated with vsv-i, v920, or rvsv-sfv via oral exposure through an infectious blood meal, and virus titer stability was confirmed for up to 14 days post-infection in both mosquito species.",PMC5893201,PMC5893201_3
"Oral infections: The study also assessed virus infection and dissemination in each mosquito species following oral exposure through an infectious blood meal, using approximately 7 log10 pfu of wt vsv-i or v920 and 6 log10 pfu rvsv-sfv, with mosquito suspensions containing five mosquitoes homogenized in 1000 Î¼l mosquito diluent. Aliquots of spiked homogenate were titrated at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 120, and 168 hours post infection by vero cell plaque assay.",PMC5893201,PMC5893201_4
