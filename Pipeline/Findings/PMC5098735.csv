"The authors found that the antibacterial effects of gra and its derivatives, gr-s and gr-k, are strongest for gr-su, followed by gr-k and then by gra.",PMC5098735,PMC5098735_0
"The authors observed that the expression of several virulence genes, including toxins such as enterotoxins (seh and sea) and staphylokinase (sak), as well as cell surface factors such as fnba and ica, were decreased in the presence of gra and gr-su.",PMC5098735,PMC5098735_1
"The authors found that the expression of rnaiii, responsible for the regulation of many s. aureus virulence factors, was fully repressed by gra and gr-su, suggesting that rnaiii expression is growth dependent.",PMC5098735,PMC5098735_2
"The authors found that gra and gr-su suppressed the growth of s. aureus in a dose-dependent manner, and that rnaiii expression was inhibited.",PMC5098735,PMC5098735_3
"The authors found that gra and gr-su have weak synergistic activities with other protein synthesis inhibitors, suggesting that transporters specific for gentamicin influx may be influenced by gra and gr-su.",PMC5098735,PMC5098735_4
