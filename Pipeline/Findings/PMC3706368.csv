"The study demonstrated that hcv ns3 protein interacts with cellular cdn protein, and this interaction results in partial suppression of cdn activity by ns3 protein.",PMC3706368,PMC3706368_0
"The study found that hcv ns3 protein causes a 30% reduction of the cellular 5′(3′)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity in both transiently and stably expressed systems, but it did not repress the expression of the cdn protein.",PMC3706368,PMC3706368_1
"The study showed that hcv repressed the 5′(3′)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity to 65% but did not affect the level of cdn protein expression in hcv replicon cells, while hcv replicons in hcv infected cells showed a three-fold higher 5′(3′)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity than that of non-treated cells, but did not affect the expression of cdn protein.",PMC3706368,PMC3706368_2
"The study concluded that hcv may induce diseases through inhibition of cdn activity by ns3 protein to result in the imbalance of dna precursor concentrations, as hcv ns3 protein was found to interact with cellular cdn protein, and, in turn, partially inhibits its activity.",PMC3706368,PMC3706368_3
