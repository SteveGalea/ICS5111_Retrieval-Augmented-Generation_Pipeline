"The presentation by M. Sc. Student Alexa Robitaille from the University of Montreal and CHU Sainte-Justine (CRCHUM) discussed the regulation of antiviral signal transduction in response to infection with paramyxoviruses, specifically Sendai virus (SeV) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Robitaille reported that dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) is strongly upregulated in response to infection with these paramyxoviruses, and that ectopic overexpression of DUSP1 during infection diminished the levels of phosphorylated p38 and jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) enzymes, whereas DUSP1-specific RNA interference had the opposite effect. Surprisingly, DUSP1-mediated inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation had no effect on downstream phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2)/c-Jun, or the levels of cytokines elicited during infection. Moreover, ectopic expression of DUSP1 has no effect on RSV replication in cell culture. Robitaille hypothesized that, in this system, DUSP1 may be affecting a different pool of p38 and JNK MAPK enzymes that govern alternative functions, while leaving activator protein 1 (AP-1)-mediated cytokine production intact.",PMC5371809,PMC5371809_0
"Dr. Joyce Wilson from the University of Saskatchewan presented the research of her postdoctoral fellow Dr. Yalena Amador-Canizares, who was unable to present due to travel delays. Wilson reported that they had used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to knock out Ago2, the only Ago protein with ‘slicing’ (RNA cleaving) activity. Ago2 knockout cells supported HCV replication, suggesting that at least one other Ago protein with ‘slicing’ activity can sustain high levels of HCV replication in the absence of Ago2. Wilson indicated that it will be important to methodically knock out combinations of all four Ago proteins to further elucidate their role in HCV replication.",PMC5371809,PMC5371809_1
