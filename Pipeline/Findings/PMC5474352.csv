"In a study using the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as a model, the authors found that MHV infection induced demyelination, followed by activation of myelin-specific T cells that were not pathogenic and did not lead to the development of autoimmune disease during chronic infection.",PMC5474352,PMC5474352_0
The authors discovered that MHV infection also induced regulatory T cells (Tregs) that limited the expansion of self-reactive T cells (SRTT cells) within the lymph nodes but did not affect viral persistence.,PMC5474352,PMC5474352_1
"In another study using the same model, the authors showed that Tregs were essential to limit SRTT cell expansion within the central nervous system (CNS) during chronic infection.",PMC5474352,PMC5474352_2
"The authors found that the absence of Tregs during chronic infection correlated with increased frequencies of SRTT cells within the lymph nodes and CNS inflammation, including SRTT cells, but did not affect viral clearance or the level of persistence.",PMC5474352,PMC5474352_3
The authors also found that the local lymph node environment established post infection influenced priming and expansion of SRTT cells or T cells with irrelevant specificity.,PMC5474352,PMC5474352_4
