"The proposed technique for collecting multiple liver biopsies in rats and mice involves using a disposable biopsy punch through a laparotomic approach, which preserves the integrity of the collected samples and that of the tissue remaining within the animal.",PMC4865696,PMC4865696_0
"The technique developed in this study allows researchers to assess disease processes or treatment responses over time in the same subject, thereby reducing the number of animals needed for such studies.",PMC4865696,PMC4865696_1
"The proposed technique is simple to perform, despite the need to create an abdominal incision, and may overall be the least invasive of the invasive methods used to collect repeated liver biopsies.",PMC4865696,PMC4865696_2
"The use of multiple, survival surgeries is not ideal, but in this study, the appearance of the hepatic histology coupled with the fact that only 2 animals did not survive to the third and final collection supports the use of the current proposed method of tissue collection.",PMC4865696,PMC4865696_3
"Some of the belgrade rats sustained dramatic weight losses, but these were directly related to the carbonyl iron diet and not to the surgical procedures, as the weights of the belgrade rats stabilized after the carbonyl diet was discontinued, and none of the other subjects developed diarrhea at any time during this study.",PMC4865696,PMC4865696_4
