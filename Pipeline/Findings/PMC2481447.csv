Feasibility and safety of nebulized heparin administration in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury (ALI) were demonstrated in this study.,PMC2481447,PMC2481447_0
Nebulized heparin increased activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) levels at higher doses in patients with ALI.,PMC2481447,PMC2481447_1
"Peak levels of prothrombin fragments (PTF) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were observed in patients with ALI after repeated doses of nebulized heparin, but only for the higher doses.",PMC2481447,PMC2481447_2
Nebulized heparin did not increase tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) levels in BAL fluid for any of the doses studied.,PMC2481447,PMC2481447_3
"Limitations of this study included the absence of a control group, small number of patients enrolled, and relatively short time (2 days) over which heparin was nebulized.",PMC2481447,PMC2481447_4
