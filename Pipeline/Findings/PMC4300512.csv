"A new recombinant adenovirus plasmid, pad-suj-riggfc, was constructed by ligating a 1.8-kilobase (kb) fragment that fused alv-j su gene and the fc region of rabbit igg to the gp85 coding region from the alv-j strain (js09gy07) using bamhi restriction enzyme site.",PMC4300512,PMC4300512_0
"A recombinant adenovirus plasmid, rad-suj-riggfc, was constructed by ligating a 1.8-kb fragment that fused alv-j su gene and the fc region of rabbit igg to the gp85 coding region from the alv-j strain (js09gy07) using bamhi restriction enzyme site.",PMC4300512,PMC4300512_1
"The membrane proteins from the pcdna-env_df1 cells were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody je9, which is specific to alv-j env, and resin a (thermo scientific).",PMC4300512,PMC4300512_2
The replication of alv-j in the treated cells was analyzed through western blot using mab je9.,PMC4300512,PMC4300512_3
"Three sirna against chanxa2 were synthesized by Invitrogen, and the sequences were listed in Table 1. The sirna effects on chanxa2 were detected with real-time PCR, and the replication of alv-j in the df1 cells transfected with sirna was analyzed through Western blot using mab je9. The primers of real-time PCR for alv-j gp37, anxa2, and chicken 18s and human Î²-actin were listed in Table 1.",PMC4300512,PMC4300512_4
