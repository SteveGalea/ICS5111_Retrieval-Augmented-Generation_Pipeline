The study found that the depletion of CD25+ cells using anti-CD25-PE mab and anti-PE microbeads led to the subsequent depletion of residual CD4+CD25+ cells using anti-CD25-PE mab and anti-PE microbeads in CD4+CD25- and CD8+ T cells harvested from naive or RJMV5Q-infected B6 cervical lymph nodes (cln).,PMC2684864,PMC2684864_0
The study found that the depletion of CD25+ cells using anti-CD25-PE mab and anti-PE microbeads in CD4+CD25- and CD8+ T cells harvested from naive spleens and adoptively transferred by intravenous inoculation into 5-6 week old B6 mice one day after infection with RJMV5Q led to a depletion of residual CD4+CD25+ cells using anti-CD25-PE mab and anti-PE microbeads.,PMC2684864,PMC2684864_1
"The study found that the CD4+CD25- and CD8+ T cells harvested from naive or RJMV5Q-infected B6 cervical lymph nodes (cln) added at ratios of 0.3:1, 1:1, and 3:1 in triplicate led to a depletion of residual CD4+CD25+ cells using anti-CD25-PE mab and anti-PE microbeads in CD4+CD25- and CD8+ T cells harvested from naive spleens and adoptively transferred by intravenous inoculation into 5-6 week old B6 mice one day after infection with RJMV5Q.",PMC2684864,PMC2684864_2
The study found that the CD4+CD25- and CD8+ T cells harvested from naive or RJMV5Q-infected B6 cervical lymph nodes (cln) were cultured in 96-well u-bottom plates (5 × 104 cells/well) in the presence of 1 μg/ml anti-CD3 (clone 145-2c11; Ebioscience) and 2 ×,PMC2684864,PMC2684864_3
