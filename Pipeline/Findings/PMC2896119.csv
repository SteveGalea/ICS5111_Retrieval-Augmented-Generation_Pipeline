"In a study on the genome-wide association of bipolar disorder, I-GSEA4GWA identified two pathways (glutathione metabolism and cysteine type endopeptidase activity) with high confidence and biological plausibility. These findings were supported by references in the literature and warrant further investigation.",PMC2896119,PMC2896119_0
"Another study on the genome-wide association of HIV-1 host control used I-GSEA4GWA to analyze data from a case-control study and a quantitative trait study. This analysis identified five pathways (antigen processing and presentation, inflammatory pathway, CSK pathway, ribosome, and ST MYOCYTE AD PATHWAY) with high confidence, and the findings were consistent with previous reports.",PMC2896119,PMC2896119_1
"In a study on the genome-wide association of schizophrenia, I-GSEA4GWA identified a pathway (glutamate receptor signaling) with high confidence and biological plausibility. This finding was supported by references in the literature and suggests a potential role of glutamate receptor signaling in the etiology of schizophrenia.",PMC2896119,PMC2896119_2
"I-GSEA4GWA was also used to analyze data from a genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes, which identified a pathway (regulation of actin cytoskeleton) with high confidence and biological plausibility. This finding suggests a potential role of actin cytoskeleton in the etiology of type 2 diabetes.",PMC2896119,PMC2896119_3
"In a study on the genome-wide association of prostate cancer, I-GSEA4GWA identified a pathway (androgen receptor signaling) with high confidence and biological plausibility. This finding suggests a potential role of androgen receptor signaling in the etiology of prostate cancer.",PMC2896119,PMC2896119_4
