"The study aimed to identify the complete genome sequence of canine astrovirus using multiple sets of primers based on sequences obtained from illumina reads. The authors extracted RNA directly from the centrifuged sample after faecal extraction and performed reverse transcription using random hexamers (Roche, biosystems, 50 Î¼m) followed by PCR amplification of the adaptor-ligated product with nbam24 primers. The authors compared the lowest common ancestor of known viral sequences using blastn search with an e value cut off 10 and visualized the results with MEGA v5.2.1 to evaluate the alignment.",PMC5453527,PMC5453527_0
"The authors used a near complete genome of canine astrovirus assembled using SEQUENCHER v5.0.1 sequence analysis software (GENECODES CORPORATION, ANN ARBOR, MI USA) with minimum match percentage 80 and minimum overlap 50 as assembly parameters. They performed phylogenetic analysis based on the full length amino acid sequence of the capsid region of astroviruses from various mammalian species using MEGA v6.0.",PMC5453527,PMC5453527_1
The authors identified a host and bacteria-free sequence reads for multiple sets of primers based on sequences obtained from illumina reads (S2 table). They compared the lowest common ancestor of known viral sequences using TBLASTx search with an e value cut off 10 and visualized the results with MEGA v5.2.1 to evaluate the alignment.,PMC5453527,PMC5453527_2
"The authors used multiple alignment of ORF2, conserved region to determine the distribution and number of contigs/singletons in each sample. They also performed phylogenetic analysis of the 172 conserved amino acids of the capsid region from different species (S2 fig) using CLUSTAL W from MEGA v6.0 with default settings.",PMC5453527,PMC5453527_3
The authors identified 5 most important findings from the relevant section based on the study's objective to identify the complete genome sequence of canine astrovirus using multiple sets of primers based on sequences obtained from illumina reads. Each finding was 10 to 20 words in length.,PMC5453527,PMC5453527_4
