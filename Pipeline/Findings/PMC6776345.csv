"A study comparing treatment outcomes for patients with h1n1 acute respiratory failure in 2009 and 2016 in two tertiary referral centers in South Korea found that in-hospital mortality decreased from 44% in 2009 to 18% in 2016, likely due to advances in intensive care unit (ICU) management.",PMC6776345,PMC6776345_0
"The study also found that patients in 2016 received lower tidal volumes for predicted body weight than those in 2009, potentially leading to improved survival.",PMC6776345,PMC6776345_1
"Prone positioning was associated with increased mortality in patients with h1n1 acute respiratory failure, but this may be due to its implementation in patients with severe hypoxia.",PMC6776345,PMC6776345_2
"The study found that the proportion of patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment increased from 15% in 2009 to 21% in 2016, and in-hospital mortality was lower in patients receiving ECMO in 2016 than in 2009, although this was not statistically significant due to the small sample size.",PMC6776345,PMC6776345_3
"The study found that cRRT was more frequently used with acute kidney injury in 2009 than in 2016, but cRRT in acute kidney injury was not associated with decreased in-hospital mortality, possibly due to the small sample size.",PMC6776345,PMC6776345_4
