"In a study by Xu et al., it was found that the ligand cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cgmp) up-regulates epithelial sodium channel (enac) activity via two mechanisms: release of self-inhibition externally and activation through cgmp/cyclic guanosine kinase III (cgkIII) pathway intracellularly.",PMC4807156,PMC4807156_0
"Enac mutants with the mutations γC33a, γC41a, or γC33a/C41a have significantly enhanced sodium self-inhibition and reduced open probability compared with wild-type enacs, suggesting that enac palmitoylation is an important post-translational mechanism of channel regulation.",PMC4807156,PMC4807156_1
"Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, a monogenic disorder of mineralocorticoid resistance characterized by salt-wasting, hyperkalemia, high aldosterone levels, and failure to thrive, is caused by mutations in enac, and is associated with severe and persisting multiorgan symptoms.",PMC4807156,PMC4807156_2
"The relief of self-inhibition by cgmp contributes to the acute effects, in addition to the well-known camp-pka signal pathway, and cgmp increased in murine and rat lungs both in vivo and in vitro following no application.",PMC4807156,PMC4807156_3
"Enac is involved in edema formation and kidney disorders, and compounds such as specific P2Y12 receptor activators and/or self-inhibition inhibitors could be the basis for novel pharmaceutical interventions for combating diseases associated with impaired enac function.",PMC4807156,PMC4807156_4
