"This study enrolled children with influenza during the winter season, and all the circulating influenza B strains belonged to the B/Victoria-lineage within the B/Victoria-lineage viruses persistently circulating in humans since the 2009–2010 season, which has not been changed since then.",PMC5648122,PMC5648122_0
"The study found that the prevalence of B influenza virus in Italy was 57%, which is not substantially different from that found in some other European countries.",PMC5648122,PMC5648122_1
"Among the detected B strains, three were characterized by a different pattern of mutations, and two of them harbored the I97m, K209n, and T258a mutations, while one strain harbored the K56n, V124a, and D526e mutations. These strains belong to two out of three B/Brisbane/60/2008 subclades previously described to circulate in Australia in 2015.",PMC5648122,PMC5648122_2
"The study revealed that among the detected B strains, four influenza B strains harbored a loss of an important glycosylation site in position 194–196 (HA1), and this finding suggests a possible impact of this loss in the antibody recognition after vaccination.",PMC5648122,PMC5648122_3
"The study's overall analysis of selective pressure within the influenza strains sequenced showed that influenza B evolution could be driven by both positive and negative selection, and this moderate evolution of circulating influenza B strains makes these strains antigenically similar to the vaccine strain, as since the 2009–2010 season, the influenza B vaccine strain, B/Brisbane/60/2008, has not been changed. However, based on epidemiological data from this study, it would be more appropriate to use a quadrivalent instead of a trivalent vaccine in Italy, as the introduction of this vaccine could prevent or reduce the circulation of both lineages of influenza B and improve the protection of the population against a potential severe disease.",PMC5648122,PMC5648122_4
