"Previous studies have shown that camels, specifically dromedaries, are the primary reservoir for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, a recent study found that bactrian camels, a different species of camel, can also be infected with MERS-CoV when exposed to the virus through intranasal inoculation.",PMC6977179,PMC6977179_0
"In this study, antibodies against MERS-CoV were detected in both bactrian and hybrid camels from Dubai, where dromedaries are also present, using a spike (S) protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a neutralization antibody test. The study found that 41% of the bactrian camels and 55% of the hybrid camels were seropositive for MERS-CoV, suggesting that these camels may have acquired the virus through contact with MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries.",PMC6977179,PMC6977179_1
"The study also found a strong correlation between the antibody levels detected by ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers, indicating that the tests used in this study accurately measured the presence and level of MERS-CoV antibodies in the camel sera.",PMC6977179,PMC6977179_2
"The study's findings suggest that both bactrian and hybrid camels, in addition to dromedaries, may serve as potential sources of MERS-CoV transmission to humans. Therefore, it may be necessary to immunize all three species of camels to reduce the risk of MERS-CoV transmission to humans.",PMC6977179,PMC6977179_3
"The study's results also suggest that bactrian camels, which were previously thought to not be a reservoir for MERS-CoV, may be another possible source of the virus, as MERS-CoV antibodies were detected in camels from a private collection in Dubai, where dromedaries are also present. However, in all previous studies that investigated MERS-CoV in bactrian camels, none of the camels had detectable MERS-CoV antibodies, and these camels were kept in regions where dromedaries were not present.",PMC6977179,PMC6977179_4
