The study found that there was a significant increase in the expression of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) alpha and beta isoforms in the sputum of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).,PMC3890402,PMC3890402_0
The study also demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the expression of p38 MAPK and the expression of the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL8 in the sputum of COPD patients.,PMC3890402,PMC3890402_1
"The study revealed that the expression of p38 MAPK in the sputum was significantly correlated with the number of neutrophils in COPD patients, indicating a possible role in the initiation and maintenance of airway inflammation.",PMC3890402,PMC3890402_2
"The study showed that the expression of p38 MAPK in the sputum was significantly correlated with a reduction in forced expiratory volume (FEV1)% in COPD patients, indicating a possible role in the development of lung function impairment in COPD.",PMC3890402,PMC3890402_3
"The study suggests that p38 MAPK is a critical factor in the development of airway inflammation in COPD patients through the induction of CXCL8 signaling, which may contribute to airway remodeling in COPD patients.",PMC3890402,PMC3890402_4
