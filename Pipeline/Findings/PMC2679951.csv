The persistence of jhmv-specific CD8+ T cells in the central nervous system (CNS) is independent of IL-15 and IL-7.,PMC2679951,PMC2679951_0
"CD8+ T cells persisting in the CNS express low levels of CD127 and gradually downregulate CD44 expression, suggesting local differentiation into long-lived memory CD8+ T cells.",PMC2679951,PMC2679951_1
Low turnover contributes to CD8+ T cell maintenance in different anatomical compartments.,PMC2679951,PMC2679951_2
CD8+ T cells persisting in the CNS are derived from effector CD8+ T cells recruited into the CNS during peak inflammation and slowly adopt a mixed phenotype with characteristics of both effector and memory CD8+ T cells.,PMC2679951,PMC2679951_3
The CNS has a unique capacity for long-term maintenance of memory CD8+ T cells largely independent of IL-15 and IL-7.,PMC2679951,PMC2679951_4
