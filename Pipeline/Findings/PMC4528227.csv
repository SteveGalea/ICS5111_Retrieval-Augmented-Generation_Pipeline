This study investigated the role of basal autophagy in herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) infection using HSV-2 strain 333 and HSV-2-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-lc3wt plasmid.,PMC4528227,PMC4528227_0
"The authors found that HSV-2 infection induced the formation of LC3-GFP puncta, which were dependent on basal autophagy.",PMC4528227,PMC4528227_1
"They also observed that HSV-2 infection led to an increase in the number of autophagosomes, as well as the accumulation of p62 and SQSTM1 proteins, which are associated with autophagy.",PMC4528227,PMC4528227_2
"The study showed that HSV-2 infection caused an increase in the expression of LC3 and ATG5 proteins, which are involved in the initiation and elongation phases of autophagy, respectively.",PMC4528227,PMC4528227_3
"Additionally, the authors found that HSV-2 infection led to an increase in the phosphorylation of ULK1 and MAP1LC3, which are involved in the activation and maturation phases of autophagy, respectively. These findings suggest that HSV-2 infection induces the formation of autophagosomes through the activation of the autophagy pathway.",PMC4528227,PMC4528227_4
