"This study found that a higher uric acid (UA) level, specifically in the highest UA tertile, was associated with a lower risk of all-cause, cardiovascular (CV), and infection-associated mortality in female end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), independent of several confounding factors.",PMC6262420,PMC6262420_0
"The study's findings contrast those from previous studies, as some reported a j-shaped relationship between UA and mortality, while others reported a protective role for UA in male ESRD patients with diabetes.",PMC6262420,PMC6262420_1
"The reasons for the differences in the impact of UA on patient survival between male and female patients have yet to be clarified, and may be due to patient ethnicity, differences in the follow-up period, differences in the adjusted confounders, and differences in serum UA levels between men and women.",PMC6262420,PMC6262420_2
"The study suggests that women on PD with low UA levels may be at increased risk of mortality due to potential biomarkers of protein-energy wasting, such as low levels of serum albumin and phosphate.",PMC6262420,PMC6262420_3
"The study highlights the need for further prospective studies to confirm the relationship between UA and mortality and to clarify the underlying mechanisms, such as the role of UA in antioxidant capacity.",PMC6262420,PMC6262420_4
