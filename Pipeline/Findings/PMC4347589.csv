"In a study, researchers demonstrated that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) can become airborne and remain infectious while suspended in the air. This was shown through experiments with 12 infected pigs and 8 swine herds located in Oklahoma, USA. PEDV was detected in air samples collected from both infected pigs and field sites. The study revealed that PEDV genetic material can be transported over long distances, up to 10 miles downwind of infected farms, although infectivity could not be shown in air samples collected under field conditions. The authors speculate that this is likely due to the lower viral concentration in field samples or the inactivation of the virus by temperature, solar light intensity, ultraviolet radiation, or during sample storage. The authors suggest that further research is needed to determine the airborne infectious dose needed to induce PEDV infection and the impact of environmental factors such as UV light, relative humidity, and temperature on PEDV viability.",PMC4347589,PMC4347589_0
"The study found that PEDV can remain infectious while suspended in the air, and infectious PEDV particles can be detected in air samples collected both experimentally and under field conditions. Pigs inoculated with diluted air samples developed clinical signs and lesions, indicating that air samples contained infectious PEDV.",PMC4347589,PMC4347589_1

"The study found that PEDV genetic material could be detected in air samples collected from both infected pigs and field sites, with an estimated number of RNA copies per m3 of air ranging from 1x106 to 1x109 in experimentally infected pigs and from 4.99x105 to 4.21x103 in field sites. The authors suggest that further research is needed to determine the airborne infectious dose needed to induce PEDV infection and the impact of environmental factors such as UV light, relative humidity",PMC4347589,PMC4347589_3
