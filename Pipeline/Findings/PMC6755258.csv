"The patient presented with acute-onset unilateral flaccid weakness, which is suggestive of acute flaccid myelitis, but his MRI findings were more consistent with transverse myelitis, involving mainly the cervical spine.",PMC6755258,PMC6755258_0
"The patient's neurological symptoms developed within one week of his respiratory illness, and his MRI showed mainly cervical spinal cord involvement, which is unusual as M. Pneumoniae-associated transverse myelitis usually involves the thoracic spinal cord and arises 2-4 weeks after antecedent respiratory infection.",PMC6755258,PMC6755258_1
"The patient's MRI revealed cord swelling with T2 prolongation and without contrast enhancement extending from the brainstem at the level of the middle cerebellar peduncle through the medulla and the cervical spinal cord to the C7 level, which is most consistent with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) due to involvement of â‰¥3 vertebral segments.",PMC6755258,PMC6755258_2
"The patient's MRI showed t2 prolongation starting in the brainstem at the level of the middle cerebellar peduncle and extending into the medulla and cervical spinal cord to the C7 level, with illdefined margins and no enhancement after gadolinium contrast administration.",PMC6755258,PMC6755258_3
"The patient's MRI revealed high intrathecal antibodies to M. Pneumoniae, which is suggestive of M. Pneumoniae-associated transverse myelitis, as serum M. Pneumoniae antibodies were not obtained due to their poor sensitivity and specificity as mentioned above.",PMC6755258,PMC6755258_4
