The study identifies ifitm1 as a key anti-hcv effector isg that inhibits entry of hcv into hepatocytes by altering the function of essential coreceptors such as cd81.,PMC3566288,PMC3566288_0
"Ifitm1 localizes to hepatic tight junctions and mediates cd81 redistribution into the tight junction complex to impose an enhanced association with occludin and other tight junction factors, disrupting the assembly of coreceptor interactions and suppressing the hcv entry process.",PMC3566288,PMC3566288_1
"The study proposes that the primary role of tetraspanins such as cd81 is the organization of membrane complex formation, an essential process in viral entry into host cells and a likely target of ifitm1-mediated viral disruption.",PMC3566288,PMC3566288_2
The study demonstrates that ifitm1 localizes to hepatic tight junctions and provides new insights into the cellular functions of this molecule.,PMC3566288,PMC3566288_3
The study suggests that strategies that effectively induce ifitm1 expression and function could serve to improve existing anti-hcv therapies to increase sustained sustained virologic response rates.,PMC3566288,PMC3566288_4
