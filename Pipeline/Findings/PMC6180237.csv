"The study found that zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can lead to fetal malformations, as four out of six cases with villous immaturity (observed in hematoxylin and eosin staining and morphometric analysis) were associated with congenital disorders caused by ZIKV infection.",PMC6180237,PMC6180237_0
"The study revealed that human placental samples from women infected with ZIKV at different gestational periods showed ZIKV-positive fetal Hofbauer cells (HFCs) in the placenta, regardless of the period at which infection occurred, suggesting that ZIKV can persist in the placenta for several months after maternal infection and may provide a viral source for continued fetal infection.",PMC6180237,PMC6180237_1
"The study found that Hofbauer cells (HFCs) are the most frequently observed infected cells, as they were detected in placental samples from six cases of ZIKV infection in pregnant women.",PMC6180237,PMC6180237_2
"The study showed that Hofbauer cells (HFCs) are the only ZIKV-positive fetal cells in the placenta, as ZIKV genomic material and viral particles were detected in placental cells until the end of pregnancy, regardless of the trimester in which infection occurred.",PMC6180237,PMC6180237_3
"The study suggested that the most plausible hypothesis for the transplacental transmission of ZIKV would be related to its association with HFCs and its migratory ability to reach the fetal vessels and then infect the fetus either by transcytosis or through ZIKV-infected ""trojan horse"" cells.",PMC6180237,PMC6180237_4
