"A key finding is the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment, leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria with multiple resistance determinants (superbugs) in various environmental compartments, such as soil, water, and food production environments.",PMC3764079,PMC3764079_0
"Another important finding is the potential for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance determinants through horizontal gene transfer events between bacterial species, leading to the potential for the emergence of novel antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in environmental compartments.",PMC3764079,PMC3764079_1
"A third key finding is the potential for the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants between bacterial species to facilitate the spread of resistance determinants to other bacterial species, leading to the potential for the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains with multiple resistance determinants (superbugs).",PMC3764079,PMC3764079_2
"A fourth important finding is the potential for the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants between bacterial species to facilitate the spread of resistance determinants to other bacterial species, leading to the potential for the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains with multiple resistance determinants (superbugs) that may have enhanced virulence and virulence factors, leading to more severe infections and disease.",PMC3764079,PMC3764079_3
"A fifth key finding is the need for the development of dose-response information for secondary illness end points resulting from antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, as well as for the potential for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance determinants through horizontal gene transfer events between bacterial species, leading to the potential for the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains with multiple resistance determinants (superbugs) and their potential impact on human health.",PMC3764079,PMC3764079_4
