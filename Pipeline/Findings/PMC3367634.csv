A new genotype of porcine norovirus (gii-19) closely related to human gii noroviruses has been identified in swine in China.,PMC3367634,PMC3367634_0
"This porcine norovirus genotype, similar to the QW101 strain, shares high amino acid identity with human gii noroviruses from three different continents.",PMC3367634,PMC3367634_1
"The porcine norovirus genotype QW101-like, similar to the human gii norovirus strain, replicated in gnotobiotic pigs and shed through fecal shedding.",PMC3367634,PMC3367634_2
"Antigenic cross-reactivity between antiserum to the porcine norovirus genotype QW101-like and capsid proteins of human gii noroviruses was observed, with highest cross-reactivity to gii-3, 4, and 6 noroviruses.",PMC3367634,PMC3367634_3
The identification of potential recombinant porcine norovirus strains raises questions about whether pigs may serve as reservoirs for the emergence of new human noroviruses or if porcine/human gii recombinants could emerge.,PMC3367634,PMC3367634_4
