"This study detected rvas in 9.4% of fecal samples from four Ohio swine farms, with higher prevalence in nursing piglets (21.1%) than in weaned piglets (2.1%). Asymptomatic rva infections were also reported in nursing and postweaning piglets, with a higher prevalence in nursing piglets (27.7%) than in weaned piglets (6.6%).",PMC3666770,PMC3666770_0
"The study found that the g9 genotype, which was the most commonly detected genotype in Thailand, Spain, and the United States, is also the most common genotype in Ohio swine farms, with a prevalence of 78%. The study also identified three distinct sublineages of rvas, with one sublineage clustering with the India/Thailand strains and another sublineage clustering with the Japan strains, while the third group clustered separately on its own branch.",PMC3666770,PMC3666770_1
"The study reported fewer distinct g-p genotype combinations (17) in Ohio swine farms than in previous studies in Europe and Asia. However, the detected g and p genotypes are common in pig populations worldwide, and the genetic diversity, such as reported in this study, in the same region may have resulted from the introduction of new rva strains.",PMC3666770,PMC3666770_2
"This study found that rvas are more frequently detected in nursing piglets (21.1%) than in weaned piglets (2.1%) and that rva was detected more frequently (9.8%) in asymptomatic animals than in symptomatic animals (19%). Higher maternal immunity levels, naturally attenuated rva strains, or rv shedding before or after the resolution of diarrhea could account for the occurrence of rva infections in asymptomatic animals.",PMC3666770,PMC3666770_3
"This study reported fewer genotype combinations (17) in Ohio swine farms than in previous studies in Europe and Asia. However, since rv infections cannot be diagnosed solely based on clinical signs, laboratory tests are necessary for reliable rv surveillance and can be useful in clinical settings to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics which cannot prevent viral diarrheas. Therefore, given the low frequency of rva detected and the low number of farms surveyed within only Ohio, large-scale epidemiological investigations are needed",PMC3666770,PMC3666770_4
