"The study reports the development of a sandwich elisa for the detection of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, which is specific for SARS-CoV and has a high sensitivity for nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens during the early phase of infection, as early as day 6 from symptom onset.",PMC446266,PMC446266_0
"The elisa is specific for SARS-CoV as the nucleocapsid protein shares only 32.7% and 21.3% amino acid identities with those of human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, respectively.",PMC446266,PMC446266_1
The study shows that nucleocapsid protein can be detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens as early as day 6 from symptom onset and in 83% of samples taken from days 11 to 15.,PMC446266,PMC446266_2
"The study suggests that the elisa may detect cases that RT-PCR has missed, as 6 of the 34 positive nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens and 9 of the 36 positive fecal specimens were found to be negative by RT-PCR.",PMC446266,PMC446266_3
"The study indicates that the elisa may serve as an alternative tool for the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection in laboratories with limited resources and expertise, as it is more convenient and economical than RT-PCR.",PMC446266,PMC446266_4
