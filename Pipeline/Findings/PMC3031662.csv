"Tetracyclines are a class of antibiotics that have been used for over 60 years. The most commonly used tetracyclines are tetracycline (TC), doxycycline (Doxy), and minocycline (Min).",PMC3031662,PMC3031662_0
"TC, Doxy, and Min have all been shown to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. This inhibition is beneficial in many pathological conditions in which MMP-mediated proteolysis contributes to pathogenesis, such as heart remodeling, tumor invasion, and inflammation. Currently, the only clinically available MMP inhibitor is Doxy, and it is indicated only for the treatment of periodontitis.",PMC3031662,PMC3031662_1
"TC, Doxy, and Min all have a multiple-substituted phenol ring, similar to vitamin E. The phenol ring is key to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging abilities of these compounds. Min directly scavenges ROS in several cell-free mixed-radical assays with an IC50 of 3-40 μM, which is 9-250 times more potent than TC or Doxy.",PMC3031662,PMC3031662_2
"In addition to inhibiting MMPs directly, TC, Doxy, and Min all inhibit MMP synthesis. Doxy inhibited cytokine-induced MMP-8 mRNA and protein accumulation in cultured rat synovial fibroblasts. In cultured human skin fibroblasts, TC inhibited interleukin-1 (IL-1)-induced MMP-3 expression. Since MMP transcription is induced by a host of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other growth factors, it is likely that these upstream signaling cascades leading to MMP expression are important targets of TC, Doxy, and Min.",PMC3031662,PMC3031662_3
The tetracyclines possess anti-inflammatory properties. Doxy is successfully used in the treatment of skin conditions such as acne and rosacea. Biopsies of inflammatory lesions of patients with acne yield increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α,PMC3031662,PMC3031662_4
