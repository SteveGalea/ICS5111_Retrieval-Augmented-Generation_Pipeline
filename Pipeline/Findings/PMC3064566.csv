"In Thailand, there is a significant and open trade in exotic reptiles and amphibians, with large numbers of allegedly captive-bred tortoises exported from Kazakhstan and Jordan to Japan, and to a lesser extent Thailand. The CITES Secretariat has expressed concerns about the trade in tortoises from these countries.",PMC3064566,PMC3064566_0
"The trade in live reptiles and amphibians to supply the exotic pet market is well-documented, with periodic surveys and detailed analysis required to gauge the scale of trade and identify trends in species composition, countries of origin, and end-market destinations beyond Thailand.",PMC3064566,PMC3064566_1
"The majority of the amphibians and reptiles imported into Thailand are to supply the exotic pet market, but other than that, the trade is considered commercial. The trade in wild-caught specimens is significant, but the pattern of the ratio of captive-bred to wild-caught specimens being imported is erratic, with a clear increase in volumes imported in some years and none in others.",PMC3064566,PMC3064566_2
"Concerns about the import of allegedly captive-bred testudo spp. Tortoises from Kazakhstan and Jordan to Japan, and to a lesser extent Thailand, have been expressed. The CITES Secretariat has also noted the practice of rearing young from eggs laid by gravid wild females taken temporarily into captivity as a means of producing large numbers of allegedly captive-bred tortoises in Kazakhstan and Jordan.",PMC3064566,PMC3064566_3
"The trade in wildlife from non-CITES parties (Lebanon and Macao) should be investigated to ensure it does not violate the regulations and intentions of CITES. The materials and methods used in this paper involved retrieving data on international trade from the WCMC-CITES Trade Database for the period 1990-2007, focusing on commercial trade in captive-bred and wild-caught live reptiles and amphibians, excluding all non-commercial trade, e.g., exchange between zoos or export for scientific purposes. Data on the conservation status was retrieved from the IUCN Red List website, and we restricted our analysis of volumes and species compositions to the last ten years for which data was available (1998-2007).",PMC3064566,PMC3064566_4
