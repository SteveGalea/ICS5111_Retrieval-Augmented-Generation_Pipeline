"In a study investigating the effects of gene-based vaccination and protein adjuvant combinations on immune responses, it was found that dna priming followed by adenoviral boosting for several antigens can elicit strong cd4 and cd8 cellular immune responses, while protein vaccines typically utilize adjuvants that elicit strong cd4 responses and minimal cd8 responses. Rad vector boosting, on the other hand, elicits strong cd8 responses, but the antibody response is substantial.",PMC1280202,PMC1280202_0
"The study also revealed that inactivated virus with adjuvant can boost animals primed with rad vectors, leading to an antigen-specific increase in cd4 responses and a diminished cd8 response, which is similar in magnitude to the stimulation seen without boosting. The cd8 response was not affected either by the antigen or by the adjuvant.",PMC1280202,PMC1280202_1
"The study suggests that the ability to stimulate the cd4 responses may be desirable if the immune response is largely dependent on neutralizing antibodies, as several s glycoproteins have been identified that are resistant to neutralization, and recent data suggest that the antibody-resistant strains preferentially recognize the civet ace-2 protein.",PMC1280202,PMC1280202_2
"The study found that the ability to perform a prime-boost immunization with clinically relevant products, such as inactivated virus, and to analyze their immunogenicity affords an opportunity to examine synergy between these different vaccine candidates that have clinical implications.",PMC1280202,PMC1280202_3
"The study highlights the need to recognize that vaccines for animal coronaviruses which rely on humoral immunity have not proven efficacious and that current animal models of sars infection that faithfully replicate human disease do not exist. Therefore, it is presently not possible to evaluate relative vaccine efficacy, and a variety of novel approaches, including adaptation of virus to different species, the development of transgenic animals expressing the human ace-2 receptor, and the use of aged animals in challenge models, may assist in this effort in the future.",PMC1280202,PMC1280202_4
