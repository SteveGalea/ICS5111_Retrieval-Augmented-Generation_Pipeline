"A key pathogenic factor in nec development is the disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier function, which leads to the translocation of bacteria and endotoxins into the systemic circulation.",PMC4124648,PMC4124648_0
"The activation of the innate immune response, mediated by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), contributes to the pathogenesis of nec by promoting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to intestinal inflammation and injury.",PMC4124648,PMC4124648_1
The gut microbiota composition and the interaction between the host and the microbiota are crucial factors in the pathogenesis of nec. The overgrowth of enterococcus and the depletion of lactobacillus are associated with an increased risk of nec.,PMC4124648,PMC4124648_2
"The administration of probiotics, such as lactobacillus, can reduce the incidence of nec in preterm neonates, but the optimal dosing strategy and the long-term effects of microbial manipulation on health and development are still not well established.",PMC4124648,PMC4124648_3
