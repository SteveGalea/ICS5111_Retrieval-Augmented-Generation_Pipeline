"In a study of 242 patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbation in Scotland, 12% were found to meet universally agreed criteria for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction with raised troponin and either chest pain or serial electrocardiogram (ECG) changes (Figure 3). The period following an exacerbation was found to be particularly high risk, as in a large observational database in the UK, the relative risks of cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke were 10.71, 3.20, and 2.31 respectively, in 2,289 patients, for the 180 days after their first exacerbation compared to the 180 days preceding it (85).",PMC3750926,PMC3750926_0
