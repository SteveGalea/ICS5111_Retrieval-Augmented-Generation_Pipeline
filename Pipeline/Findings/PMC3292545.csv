The study describes a novel platform for screening of antiviral compounds and antibodies against newly emerging viruses that can be established rapidly using just the sequence information of new and emerging viruses.,PMC3292545,PMC3292545_0
"The system allows for miniaturization to a 384-well format, making it amenable to high-throughput screening.",PMC3292545,PMC3292545_1
"The study demonstrates the feasibility of directly raising antibodies against the native form of the protein, which avoids problems of purity and amount typically encountered with recombinant proteins.",PMC3292545,PMC3292545_2
"The system allows for the simulation of multi-cycle replication of a virus, which distinguishes itself from single-cycle infection assays.",PMC3292545,PMC3292545_3
"The study describes a cost-effective protocol for pseudotyping viruses, which can be used to infect cells expressing glycoproteins of the same virus for simulation of multi-cycle replication.",PMC3292545,PMC3292545_4
