"A study published in the Journal of Virology in 2021 reported that the administration of non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors, including cyclosporine A, DEB025/ALISPROVIR, and NIM811, suppresses the de novo formation of double membrane vesicles, which serve as a compartment where viral rna replication occurs sheltered from innate cell sensors in human coronavirus (HCoV) infection.",PMC4491039,PMC4491039_0
"The study also showed that viruses harboring DEB025/ALISPROVIR or NIM811 are able to generate double membrane vesics in cyclophilin A knockdown cells, consistent with prior observations indicating that these substitutions in DEB025/ALISPROVIR or NIM811 obviate the need for cyclophilin A binding and ppiase catalysis, leading to a cyclophilin A independent phenotype.",PMC4491039,PMC4491039_1
"For HCoV, cyclophilin A, in concert with DEB025/ALISPROVIR or NIM811, plays a highly specific and potentially singular role in the replication cycle by regulating the biogenesis of membranous web formation.",PMC4491039,PMC4491039_2
"The role of cyclophilins in coronavirus infection remains to be understood, but recent reports have demonstrated that the dependence on cyclophilins of distinct viruses for various steps of replication such as viral entry, formation of protective membranous compartments, rna synthesis and multiplication, viral genome uncoating, nuclear import, and nuclear entry, emphasizes the potential of cyclophilin inhibitors as a therapeutic agent.",PMC4491039,PMC4491039_3
"The neutralization of cyclophilin A with cyclosporine A or NIM811 inhibits the replication of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and dengue flaviviruses (DENV). The apparent dependence of distinct viruses on cyclophilins for various steps of replication suggests that cyclophilin inhibitors could be exploited as a first-line of protection against new and emerging viruses.",PMC4491039,PMC4491039_4
