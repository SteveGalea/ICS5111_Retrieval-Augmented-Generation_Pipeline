"Tgev infection in ipec-j2 cells increases glucose uptake through the protein expression of sglt1 and glut2, resulting in enhanced tgev replication.",PMC5112927,PMC5112927_0
"Tgev infection in ipec-j2 cells leads to increased protein expression of sglt1 and glut2, without significant changes in mRNA expression levels, indicating accelerated glucose absorption.",PMC5112927,PMC5112927_1
"The effects of coronaviruses (including tgev) on glucose uptake have not been reported, but the protein expression of egfr and p-egfr, which mediate sglt1 expression, both promote glucose uptake in ipec-j2 cells during tgev infection.",PMC5112927,PMC5112927_2
"Tgev infection in ipec-j2 cells reaches a peak at 48 hpi, and increased glucose absorption enhances tgev replication, suggesting that glucose may be transformed into glutamine in infected cells.",PMC5112927,PMC5112927_3
"The mechanism through which tgev causes diarrhea has not been elucidated, but glucose uptake has been shown to cause diarrhea, and the finding that one mechanism occurs more rapidly than microvilli effacement provides a plausible explanation for the rapid onset of severe watery diarrhea, given the crucial role of sglt1 in the daily uptake of large amounts of fluids from the normal intestine. However, tgev infection resulted in increased sglt1 expression, leading to rapid glucose uptake, which in turn supplied glucose to the virus and promoted long-term infection by tgev in the intestine.",PMC5112927,PMC5112927_4
