"The study found that the hpre and wpre elements, which promote the nuclear export of intronless transcripts, can enhance expression of heterologous genes in vitro, particularly when combined with appropriate promoter/enhancer elements at the transcription level.",PMC2719066,PMC2719066_0
"The study demonstrated that hpre or wpre has a greater effect on gag gene expression in vitro than cmv introna, and pinhgag carrying both elements induced the best immune responses among all groups.",PMC2719066,PMC2719066_1
The study showed that dna vaccine carrying an hiv gene with native codon usage could achieve impressive in vitro expression and in vivo immunogenicity in a rev-independent manner if the elements were appropriately optimized at the posttranscriptional level.,PMC2719066,PMC2719066_2
The study highlighted the application of this alternative gene optimization strategy in high-throughput screening experiments involving native or hiv genes or the production of lentiviral vectors where the codon-optimized gene is not available.,PMC2719066,PMC2719066_3
"The study observed that pinhgag plasmid in general showed the strongest immunogenicity among all constructs, and immune responses induced by 10 Î¼g of pinhgag were comparable to those induced by the same amount of codon-optimized gag dna vaccine.",PMC2719066,PMC2719066_4
