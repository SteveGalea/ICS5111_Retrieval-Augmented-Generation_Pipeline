"Breast cancer - A genomic approach: One of the most significant findings from the study by van't Veer et al. (2002) is the identification of a molecular profile of 70 genes that can predict which patients with early-stage breast cancer are at high risk of developing distant metastases within five years (van't Veer et al., 2002). This study has the potential to significantly improve the current breast cancer classification system and influence treatment, as it can accurately differentiate between low-risk and high-risk women, reducing the number of women who would ordinarily be advised to receive adjuvant treatments from between 70-90% (based on current clinical criteria) to 40%.",PMC3525069,PMC3525069_0
"Breast cancer - A genomic approach: In a validation study by van de Vijver et al. (2002), the expression analysis of 295 new breast cancer tumours was applied to the patient cohort in the initial study by van't Veer et al. (2002), and it again proved to be a more accurate predictor of distant metastases within five years than the conventional clinical criteria, improving the likelihood of identifying the patients who will benefit most from adjuvant therapy. The probability of remaining metastasis-free after ten years was 85.2% in the patients classified as having a 'good-prognosis signature' and 50.6% in the patients classified as having a 'poor-prognosis signature'.",PMC3525069,PMC3525069_1
"Ovarian cancer - A proteomics approach: Petricoin et al. (2001) used mass spectroscopy coupled with an artificial intelligence computer algorithm to develop a system of low molecular weight serum protein profiling and identified a specific protein signature that was associated with ovarian cancer from asymptomatic women with a high risk of developing the disease. This study accurately identified all of the cases of early-stage ovarian cancer, making it a potential diagnostic tool that has so far been lacking in the clinical laboratory.",PMC3525069,PMC3525069_2
"Breast cancer - A genomic approach: The conventional consensus criteria, advised by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus panel and the International Consensus Panel from the St Gallen Conference, advise treatment for up to 90% of patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer.",PMC3525069,PMC3525069_3
