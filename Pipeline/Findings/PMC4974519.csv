"In response to coronavirus infection, various viruses encode proteins that mimic the function of host protein 7, which is highly divergent among coronaviruses and functions to regulate host and viral gene expression. This protein is involved in the regulation of host protein translation, prevents viral and cellular mRNA translation, and facilitates efficient viral gene expression in infected cells.

"Coronavirus nsp1, encoded by α and β coronaviruses, suppresses host mRNAs translation without affecting their stability and also inhibits the expression of reporter genes, probably via binding to ribosomal protein s6 and blocking the mRNA binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit. (10-20 words)",PMC4974519,PMC4974519_1
"The interaction of protein 7 and pp1c, a conserved sequence motif in the 5'-leader sequence of viral mRNA, protects viral mRNAs from nsp1-induced RNA cleavage and facilitates efficient viral gene expression in infected cells. (10-20 words)",PMC4974519,PMC4974519_2
"Coronavirus nsp1, encoded by sars-coronavirus, also selectively targets nuclear host mRNAs and transports them to the cytoplasm for degradation and translation inhibition. (10-20 words)",PMC4974519,PMC4974519_3
"The nsp1-40S ribosome complex also inhibits the translation of different reporter mRNAs in cells or cell extract, but not in the in vitro translation system such as rabbit reticulocyte lysate, indicating that coronavirus nsp1 relies on host factors to exert the inhibitory effect. (10-20 words)",PMC4974519,PMC4974519_4
