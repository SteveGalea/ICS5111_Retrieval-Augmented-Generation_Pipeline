"Alteration of the palmitoylation site in m2 does not affect virus replication, assembly, or filament formation in tissue culture cells.",PMC2738213,PMC2738213_0
"The m2c50s mutation, which leads to a minor attenuation in the virulence of the virus in vivo, does not affect infectious virus production in primary mtec cultures.",PMC2738213,PMC2738213_1
"Defining the precise mechanisms responsible for the subtle change in rwsn-m2c50s virulence observed in the mouse model of infection awaits a more extensive analysis of virus replication in differentiated mtec cultures and other cell types in the lungs, such as dendritic cells and macrophages.",PMC2738213,PMC2738213_2
"In contrast to the critically important role of palmitoylation of the ha protein for virus replication in vitro, palmitoylation of the m2 protein appears to be dispensable for replication in a number of different cell types and culture systems.",PMC2738213,PMC2738213_3
"The expression, oligomerization, and ion channel activity of udorn m2c50s is comparable to that of wild-type m2, and the introduction of a c50s mutation into a reassortant virus consisting of one equine influenza a virus segment in the genetic background of a mouse-adapted human influenza a virus does not affect infectious virus production after infection of mdck cells, calu-3 cells, and mtec cultures.",PMC2738213,PMC2738213_4
