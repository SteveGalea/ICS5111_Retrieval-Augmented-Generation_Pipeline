"Enos, an endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase, was found to be upregulated significantly through recombinant plasmid transfection in the mouse pancreatic β cell line min6, leading to increased sirt1 expression through direct protein-protein interaction.",PMC5526166,PMC5526166_0
"The present study showed that overexpressed enos promoted mouse pancreatic β cell proliferation and protected mouse pancreatic β cells from cell apoptosis, indicating a potential therapeutic target for diabetes.",PMC5526166,PMC5526166_1
"The study suggested that enos-mediated nitric oxide may regulate sirt1 expression during aging of endothelial cells, as the interaction of sirt1 and enos is important in the augmentation of the protective effect of statins against endothelial senescence.",PMC5526166,PMC5526166_2
"The findings also highlighted the importance of the interaction of sirt1 and enos in the augmentation of the protective effect of statins against endothelial senescence, as testosterone-induced enos activity increased sirt1 expression in endothelial cells in type 2 diabetic rats.",PMC5526166,PMC5526166_3
"The study implied that enos may induce sirt1 activation, which is indicated to have a protective role in endothelial cells, and that future research may focus on the identification of an effective drug playing a protective and therapeutic role for diabetes through the targeting of enos and regulation of sirt1.",PMC5526166,PMC5526166_4
