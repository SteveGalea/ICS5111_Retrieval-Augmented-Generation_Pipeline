"In this study, a/h3 was the most frequently detected virus in adults admitted to a tertiary hospital in Australia during the period 2012-2015. However, patients infected with a/h1 had more severe clinical outcomes than those infected with a/h3, indicating that a/h1 is more severe than a/h3 in this population, despite this virus affecting younger ages (mean age 53 vs. 65 years for h1 and h3 patients respectively).",PMC7003621,PMC7003621_0
"Hospitalised patients with influenza a/h1 had more severe clinical outcomes than patients with a/h3, inf-b, and the non-influenza respiratory viruses.",PMC7003621,PMC7003621_1
"Patients with a/h1 were more likely to be admitted to icu, develop pneumonia, and be hospitalised longer than patients with a/h3, indicating that a/h1 is more severe than a/h3 in this population.",PMC7003621,PMC7003621_2
"In this study, patients with influenza a/h1 had similar or greater odds of pneumonia, icu admission, ventilation, and death compared to patients with rsv or hmpv.",PMC7003621,PMC7003621_3
"Comorbidities were common, being present in approximately half of the admitted patients. However, the presence of comorbidity was significantly less likely in patients with a/h3, compared to those with rsv or hmpv. Co-morbidities were also less frequently present in patients with a/h1, however statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.074 and 0.067 for hmpv and rsv respectively). The lower number of comorbidities in patients with influenza may be due to a high proportion of people with comorbidities receiving the annual influenza vaccine, but vaccination status for the patients in this study was not available.",PMC7003621,PMC7003621_4
