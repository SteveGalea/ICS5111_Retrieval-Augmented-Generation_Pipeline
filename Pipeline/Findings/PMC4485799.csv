The study identified two novel mechanisms by which interleukin-10 (IL-10) enhances antitumor cytotoxicity 1 (CD8+) T cell responses in the plasmacytoma J558 tumor model: (a) by inhibiting the expansion of highly suppressive CD4+ T cells and (b) by promoting T cell long-term persistence.,PMC4485799,PMC4485799_0
"The study demonstrated that IL-10 deficiency significantly reduced the expression of IL-27, a cytokine that induces T cell long-term persistence, in CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in T cell persistence and a decrease in antitumor cytotoxicity.",PMC4485799,PMC4485799_1
"The study found that IL-10 deficiency significantly increased the expression of the regulatory T cell marker FoxP3, indicating a higher proportion of regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment, which may contribute to the decrease in antitumor cytotoxicity.",PMC4485799,PMC4485799_2
"The study revealed that IL-10 deficiency significantly decreased the expression of the antitumor cytokine IFN-Î³ and the antitumor cytokine-inducing cytokine IL-27, which further contributed to the decrease in antitumor cytotoxicity.",PMC4485799,PMC4485799_3
"The study showed that IL-10 deficiency significantly reduced the expansion of highly suppressive CD4+ T cells, which may contribute to the decrease in antitumor cytotoxicity by allowing regulatory T cells to suppress antitumor T cell responses.",PMC4485799,PMC4485799_4
