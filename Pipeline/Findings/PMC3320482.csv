"In a mixed undirected-directed network, each vertex (person) has an undirected degree representing the number of undirected edges joining the vertex to other vertexes as well as both an in-degree and an out-degree representing the number of directed edges coming from other persons and going to other persons, respectively. This network allows for analytically predicting the fate of an outbreak based on the probability that any given person in the population has in-degree = j, out-degree = k, and undirected-degree = m, and the average transmissibility t of the disease. The expressions for the transmissibility threshold value, the average size of an outbreak, and the probability of an epidemic are derived using percolation theory and generating function methods in another manuscript. The basic reproductive number r0 can also be calculated based on the degree distribution of the contact network.",PMC3320482,PMC3320482_0
"In a completely undirected network, the expression for the transmissibility threshold value is pjkm = j + k + m - 3, where pjkm is the probability that any given person in the population has in-degree = j, out-degree = k, and undirected-degree = m, and let t be the average transmissibility of the disease, that is, the probability that transmission of the disease occurs between an infected person and a susceptible person that are in contact with each other. The average size of an outbreak is given by s = (ln(n))/(ln(k)), and the probability of an epidemic is given by sprob = pjkm(1 - pjkm)n(n - 1), where n is the population size.",PMC3320482,PMC3320482_1
"In the main text, the authors report the following quantities: the basic reproductive number r0, the epidemic threshold tc, the average size of an outbreak s, and the probability that an epidemic will occur sprob. These quantities are derived using percolation theory and generating function methods in another manuscript.",PMC3320482,PMC3320482_2
"In a completely undirected network equation (1), the expression for the basic reproductive number can be simplified as r0 = ct, where c is the average contact rate, p is the average probability of transmission, and d is the average duration of infectiousness.",PMC3320482,PMC3320482_3
"In epidemiologic compartmental models, this equation has often been used as r0 = cpd, where",PMC3320482,PMC3320482_4
