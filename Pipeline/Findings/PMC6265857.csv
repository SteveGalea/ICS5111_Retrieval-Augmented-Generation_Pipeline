"In the context of the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, a high level of heterogeneity in secondary cases was observed, with almost 80% of 186 confirmed cases infected by five super-spreaders (147/186). One super-spreader alone infected 53% of the MERS-CoV cases via other super-spreaders (79/147). The connectivity of individuals and a higher level of infectivity were found to be the most significant factors for the MERS-CoV transmission dynamics.",PMC6265857,PMC6265857_0
"In the context of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the basic reproduction number r 0 was found to be 1.5-2.8, and a higher transmission rate led to a larger r 0 . The effect of super-spreaders on disease transmission was also observed, with super-spreaders accounting for 60% of secondary cases.",PMC6265857,PMC6265857_1
"In the context of the 2015 mers-CoV outbreak in South Korea, a small number of infectious individuals, known as super-spreaders, were found to be responsible for the majority of cases. The longer contact range and higher infectivity produced a more rapid and severe disease spread in this context. The effectiveness of isolation strategies was also investigated, with a random isolation reducing incidence proportionally, while a targeted isolation reduced the peak size and delayed the peak time.",PMC6265857,PMC6265857_2
"In the context of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the impact of isolation strategies on disease transmission was also investigated. A random isolation reduced incidence proportionally, while a targeted isolation reduced the peak size and delayed the peak time. However, a targeted isolation was found to be more effective in both contexts, while a random isolation was more effective in the context of the 2015 mers-CoV outbreak in South Korea.",PMC6265857,PMC6265857_3
"In the context of the 2015 mers-CoV outbreak in South Korea, the effectiveness of intervention strategies was also explored. Various factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers, were found to be worthy of investigation and should be incorporated into",PMC6265857,PMC6265857_4
