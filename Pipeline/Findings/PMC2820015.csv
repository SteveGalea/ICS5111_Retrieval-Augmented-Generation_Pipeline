"Gag, a viral precursor protein synthesized by HIV-1, plays a crucial role in envelope transport into lipid-rich plasma membrane domains known as detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) in primary CD4+ T cells, facilitating envelope assembly onto budding virions.",PMC2820015,PMC2820015_0
"The matrix domain of gag, specifically the lysine residue at position 30 (l30), is crucial for envelope association with DRMs and CD59-enriched compartments in primary CD4+ T cells, as disruption of this domain (l30E mutation) abrogates envelope incorporation onto virus particles and its interaction with CD59.",PMC2820015,PMC2820015_1
"The L30E mutation in gag also downmodulates envelope association with CD59-enriched compartments in primary CD4+ T cells, indicating that gag mediates envelope transport into these compartments.",PMC2820015,PMC2820015_2
"Cholera toxin B subunit (CTXb), a marker for lipid-raft-associated glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, is also found to be associated with DRMs in primary CD4+ T cells, providing further evidence for the role of lipid rafts in envelope assembly and transport.",PMC2820015,PMC2820015_3
"Disruption of the gag-env interaction in HIV-1, as seen in the L30E mutation, results in downmodulation of envelope assembly onto virus particles in CD4+ T cells, highlighting the importance of gag in this process.",PMC2820015,PMC2820015_4
