"The study characterizes the human cough aerosol model by quantifying the number and size of droplets expelled during a single cough, revealing that coughs generate predominantly small droplets (median volume 0.12 microl, median concentration 3.36 × 103 particles/mL), which rapidly dissipate (median half-life 8.2 seconds, geometric standard deviation 3.2).",PMC3331822,PMC3331822_0
"The study identifies high emitters (median concentration 14.36 × 103 particles/mL) and low emitters (median concentration 2.36 × 103 particles/mL), with no significant association between these categories and age, sex, body mass index, or smoking status.",PMC3331822,PMC3331822_1
"The study finds that cough aerosols contribute to direct, indirect, and/or airborne transmission of respiratory infections, such as influenza A virus, and highlights the need for a multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral approach to mitigate transmission through the optimization of control strategies.",PMC3331822,PMC3331822_2
"The study suggests that the viscoelastic properties of airway mucus, determined by rheological analysis, may affect airway mucus aerosolization during coughing, potentially providing insights into cough-associated droplet formation and transmission.",PMC3331822,PMC3331822_3
"The study emphasizes the need for a consensus on the effect of natural and/or non-natural compounds on airway mucus aerosolization during coughing as a critical factor in respiratory infectious disease transmission, and highlights the need for immediate attention to fill the knowledge gap and lack of consensus in this area.",PMC3331822,PMC3331822_4
