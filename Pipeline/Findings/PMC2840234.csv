"A recent study by Walker et al. Identified a broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody against HIV through the use of non-immortalized B cell culture. This method allows for the characterization of the entire antibody repertoire, production of sufficient antibody for functional assessment, and preservation of native heavy and light chain pairings to recapitulate the biology of the native repertoire.",PMC2840234,PMC2840234_0
"The same study found that the antibody, named B12, has a very long complementarity-determining region 3 (CD3) and blocks the CD4 binding site of gp120, but no contacts are made by the light chain. This unusual finding may be due primarily to the isolation of a mispaired heavy and light chain.",PMC2840234,PMC2840234_1
"Another recent study by the same authors used clonal sorting to identify individual B cells recognizing an artificially trimerized construct of the gp140 antigen of HIV. The resultant clones represented 0.5-1.9% of the total CD19+ B cells, and of the 502 recombinant clonal products tested for binding, 433 exhibited specific antigen binding, and were found to represent 134 unique antibodies. The collective reactivity of the individual antibodies corresponded to a broadly neutralizing response.",PMC2840234,PMC2840234_2
"A study by Zhu et al. Used combinatorial phage display to identify broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against HIV. The resultant clones represented âˆ¼1% of the total population, and of the 502 recombinant clonal products tested for binding, 162 exhibited specific antigen binding, and were found to represent 112 unique antibodies.",PMC2840234,PMC2840234_3
"A study by Zhang et al. Used single B cells to identify individual B cells recognizing an artificially trimerized construct of the gp140 antigen of HIV. The resultant clones represented 0.5-1.9% of the total CD19+ B cells, and of the 502 recombinant clonal products tested for binding, 123 exhibited specific antigen binding, and were found to represent 123 unique antibodies.
