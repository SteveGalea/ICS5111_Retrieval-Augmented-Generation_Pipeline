"The study isolated influenza A viruses subtypes H4N6 and H4N9 from ducks in a live bird market in Bangkok, Thailand, and both viruses had never been reported in Thailand before.",PMC3071790,PMC3071790_0
"The whole genome sequences of the viruses were determined and submitted to respective databases, revealing that gene segments of the viruses were derived from the Eurasian lineage and displayed low pathogenic characteristics with amino acids specific to avian influenza viruses.",PMC3071790,PMC3071790_1
"The study's genetic analysis showed that the viruses display amino acid changes at the receptor-binding site, which could alter biological functions and potentially affect virus transmission among birds and humans.",PMC3071790,PMC3071790_2
"The study's findings indicate that live bird markets can serve as an early warning system for influenza A virus evolution and highlight the significance of hosts, environments, and potential virus reassortment, especially in live bird markets.",PMC3071790,PMC3071790_3
"The study's findings suggest that educational campaigns, disinfection of fomites in live bird markets, and creating a rest day to interrupt the flow system could help prevent and control influenza A virus infection in live bird markets.",PMC3071790,PMC3071790_4
