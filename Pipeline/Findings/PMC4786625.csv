"In a study investigating the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant protein composed of residues 377-588 of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RBD domain fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (s377-588-fc), researchers identified several adjuvants that could further improve the immune responses. Among these adjuvants, MF59, an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant that activates non-TLR sensing receptors, was found to be superior to other adjuvants, including aluminum and freund's, in enhancing and broadening protection against MERS-CoV infection, allowing for antigen dose-sparing and increasing seroconversion and cross-reactive antibody titers after vaccination with only two doses.",PMC4786625,PMC4786625_0
"The study revealed that MF59, unlike other adjuvants, has unique characteristics, as it is the first adjuvant licensed for human use after aluminum and is an effective and safe vaccine adjuvant approved in Europe for use with influenza vaccines. Because of its strong efficacy in potentiating the immunogenicity of influenza virus antigen, MF59 allows for antigen dose-sparing and enhancing cross-reactive antibody titers after vaccination with only two doses, making it less appealing than MF59.",PMC4786625,PMC4786625_1
"The study showed that the MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccine, when formulated with MF59 adjuvant, induced highly potent specific immune responses, suggesting that MF59 is an ideal adjuvant for MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines. This finding provides a foundation for evaluating the adjuvanticity of MF59 in subunit vaccines against influenza viruses and other viruses with class I fusion proteins, such as HIV, SARS-CoV, Ebola virus, and Nipah virus.",PMC4786625,PMC4786625_2
"The study also demonstrated that the MF59-adjuvanted MERS-CoV RBD protein induced highly potent neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV infection, while another adjuvant, MPLA-SM, elicited",PMC4786625,PMC4786625_3
