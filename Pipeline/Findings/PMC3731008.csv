"During the two-year study in Khanh Hoa province, Vietnam, over 57% of the 1541 specimens tested by locally trained Vietnamese scientists were found to be positive for at least one virus, with influenza viruses, most commonly the pandemic strain A(H1N1)pdm09, being the most commonly detected.",PMC3731008,PMC3731008_0
"The study also revealed that the pandemic strain A(H1N1)pdm09 quickly replaced an established outbreak of A(H3N2) in 2009 in central Vietnam, as observed in other geographical locations.",PMC3731008,PMC3731008_1
"The study found that enterovirus circulation was restricted to the dry season in both study years, whereas rhinovirus and adenovirus circulated throughout the year, with the latter often associated with co-infections, making their clinical significance unclear.",PMC3731008,PMC3731008_2
"The study showed that the circulation and morbidity associated with common viruses, such as influenza and less common viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and coronaviruses, had a wide age demographic, as the intervention of the pandemic strain A(H1N1)pdm09 hampered the efforts to comprehensively study the seasonality of respiratory viruses in this region of Vietnam because the scale of the outbreak minimized the likelihood of detecting other circulating respiratory viruses.",PMC3731008,PMC3731008_3
"The study also highlighted the important role of enteroviruses in respiratory disease, as suspected cases appeared to have been admitted as a precaution while information on the clinical severity of this novel strain was gathered over time. The study also revealed the importance of coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses in respiratory disease, as they circulated throughout the year, with the exception of enterovirus, which circulated only in the dry season in both study years.",PMC3731008,PMC3731008_4
