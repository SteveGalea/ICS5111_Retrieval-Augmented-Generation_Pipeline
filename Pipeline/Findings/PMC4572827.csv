"After infection with bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2 (BVDV-2), leukopenia, lymphopenia, and granulocytopenia persisted longer than in previous challenge experiments for this strain (BVDV-1), with a rebound in CD4+ T-cell numbers during clinical recovery from BVDV-2 observed in BVDV-2-infected animals relative to healthy, control (BVDV-) animals.",PMC4572827,PMC4572827_0
"After infection with BVDV-2, a delay in igg response to ovalbumin in the presence of BVDV was observed, with interactions between ovalbumin status and BVDV status altering specific PBMC counts, including CD4+, CD8+, and γδ-T subsets.",PMC4572827,PMC4572827_1
"After infection with BVDV-2, a prolonged increase of CD20+ cells in the infected group compared to the controls was observed, indicating that progenitor cells for these cell types were still functional.",PMC4572827,PMC4572827_2
"After infection with BVDV-2, impaired regeneration from the bone marrow was observed, explaining the difference in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts between the BVDV+ and BVDV- groups on days 35 and 37 post-infection.",PMC4572827,PMC4572827_3
"After infection with BVDV-2, changes in total numbers of PBMC confirmed BVDV suppression of cellular responses and were temporally consistent with the observed delay in mounting a response to the novel antigen, ovalbumin, increasing the co-infection risk for fall-placed beef calves and enhancing the potential transmission between individuals within a pen.",PMC4572827,PMC4572827_4
