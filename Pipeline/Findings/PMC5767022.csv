Removing just 5.6% of nodes (25 LBMs with highest betweenness scores) significantly reduces network connectedness and the size of output and input domains by more than 50%.,PMC5767022,PMC5767022_2
Discriminating poultry types is necessary to understand how trading networks are shaped and the level of risk of disease spread they promote.,PMC5767022,PMC5767022_3
