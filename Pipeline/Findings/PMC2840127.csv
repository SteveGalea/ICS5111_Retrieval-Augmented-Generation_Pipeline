"The study demonstrates that the hepatitis B virus (HBV) induces autophagy to enhance its replication, and this induction requires the viral protein HBx, which binds to the protein PI3KC3 to enhance its activity (Findings 1 and 2).",PMC2840127,PMC2840127_0
"The study shows that HBV induces autophagy in the absence of nutrient starvation, and this induction of autophagy by HBV is mediated by PI3KC3 and autophagy (Findings 1, 2, and 3).",PMC2840127,PMC2840127_1
"The study reveals that the replication of wild-type HBV is sensitive to suppression of PI3KC3 activity, whereas the replication of the HBX-negative mutant is not (Findings 2, 3, and 4).",PMC2840127,PMC2840127_2
"The study suggests that HBV may enhance its replication via the combination of its multiple activities, including the induction of autophagy, and that the suppression of autophagy, such as by PI3KC3 knockdown, may instead exert a negative effect on HBV replication (Findings 1-4).",PMC2840127,PMC2840127_3
The study raises the possibility of targeting the autophagic pathway for the treatment of HBV patients (Findings 2-4).,PMC2840127,PMC2840127_4
