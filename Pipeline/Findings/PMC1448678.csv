"The study found that hMPV, a recently discovered respiratory virus, is associated with approximately 15% of respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children in central Israel who are negative for other common respiratory pathogens during the two winter seasons studied.",PMC1448678,PMC1448678_0
"The study revealed that hMPV infection presents with a clinical picture similar to bronchiolitis caused by RSV, with symptoms ranging from mild self-limiting respiratory illness to severe illness requiring mechanical ventilation.",PMC1448678,PMC1448678_1
"The study showed that hMPV group 1, the predominant serotype circulating, had the highest circulation rate (92% of sequenced samples) among the four subgroups reported, followed by subgroup 1b (65%) and subgroup 2b (10%).",PMC1448678,PMC1448678_2
"The study found that hMPV seroprevalence increases with age, reaching 100% within the age group of 5 to 14 years olds, and then decreases in individuals older than 14 years, ranging from a low of 72% in the age group of 20 to 49 to a high of 80% in individuals older than 60 years of age.",PMC1448678,PMC1448678_3
"The study highlighted that the viral genetic lineages and the prevalence of hMPV infections in central Israel have been identified, allowing the identification of a significant number of respiratory tract infections, and more upper respiratory tract infections will be identified when sensitive diagnostic techniques are developed and routinely applied, particularly for testing common respiratory pathogens such as rhinoviruses and coronavirus.",PMC1448678,PMC1448678_4
