"In a systematic review of 30 studies on influenza pandemic preparedness, it was found that only 4% of studies addressed all three components of pandemic preparedness: mitigation, containment, and suppression. This highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to pandemic preparedness.",PMC4481577,PMC4481577_0
"A study on the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic found that social distancing measures, such as school closures and workplace closures, reduced the effective reproduction number (R) by 40-50%.",PMC4481577,PMC4481577_1
"A modeling study on the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa found that a combination of early case detection, contact tracing, and quarantine measures could have prevented up to 70% of cases.",PMC4481577,PMC4481577_2
"A review of the use of compartmental models in pandemic preparedness and response found that such models can provide useful insights into the dynamics of epidemics and the impact of interventions, but they should be used in conjunction with other sources of information, such as laboratory studies and epidemiological data.",PMC4481577,PMC4481577_3
"A study on the use of individual-based models in pandemic preparedness and response found that such models can provide more detailed and nuanced insights into the spread of disease and the impact of interventions, but they are computationally intensive and require large amounts of data.",PMC4481577,PMC4481577_4
"A review of the use of phylogenetic methods in pandemic preparedness and response found that such methods can provide insights into the evolutionary history of pathogens and the transmission dynamics of epidemics, but they require specialized expertise in molecular biology and evolutionary theory.",PMC4481577,PMC4481577_5
"A study on the use of agent-based models in pandemic preparedness and response found that such models can provide insights into the complex and dynamic interactions between individuals and the impact of interventions in real-world settings, but they require large amounts of data and are computationally intensive.",PMC4481577,PMC4481577_6
"A review of the use of network-based models in pandemic preparedness and response found that such models can provide insights into the transmission dynamics of epidemics and the impact of network structure on disease spread, but they require specialized expertise in network theory and graphical algorithms.",PMC4481577,PMC4481577_7
A modeling study on the use of machine learning algorithms in pandemic preparedness and response found that such algorithms can provide insights into the prediction of epidemic outcomes,PMC4481577,PMC4481577_8
