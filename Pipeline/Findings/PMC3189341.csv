"Many viruses, including those causing serious human diseases, utilize sialic acid as a binding site for cell attachment.",PMC3189341,PMC3189341_0
"Viruses achieve specificity for a single type of sialylated oligosaccharide through the formation of additional contacts with functional groups beyond the sialic acid itself, and by excluding some possible ligands through steric clashes.",PMC3189341,PMC3189341_1
The viral attachment protein adenovirus fiber knob achieves selectivity for its gd1a glycan receptor by multivalent binding to a single receptor carrying two terminal sialic acid moieties separated by a defined spacer.,PMC3189341,PMC3189341_2
The interaction between adenovirus fiber knob and its gd1a glycan receptor involves a bivalent interaction in which two protomers interact with the same receptor carrying two terminal sialic acid moieties separated by a defined spacer.,PMC3189341,PMC3189341_3
Structural analysis of the interaction between adenovirus fiber knob and its gd1a glycan receptor has led to the design and synthesis of a trivalent compound that blocks attachment of adenoviruses that cause ekc.,PMC3189341,PMC3189341_4
