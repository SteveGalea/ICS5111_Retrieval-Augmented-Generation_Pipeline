"The study found that prrsv-induced il-1ra interferes with antigen-specific T helper (Th) cell differentiation and proliferation, which contributes to the poor adaptive immune response usually observed in prrsv-infected pigs.",PMC6443931,PMC6443931_0
"The study demonstrated that prrsv-induced il-1ra significantly suppresses mitogen- as well as antigen-dependent T cell expansion, which is in part responsible for the negative immunomodulatory effects of prrsv-induced il-1ra on porcine innate and adaptive immune functions.",PMC6443931,PMC6443931_1
"The study showed that prrsv-induced il-1ra could help to maintain prrsv-specific regulatory T (Treg) population, which is consistent with previous reports on the role of il-1ra in prrsv immunopathogenesis.",PMC6443931,PMC6443931_2
"The study highlighted the inhibitory effects of prrsv-induced il-1ra on apoptosis (APC) functions, including phagocytosis and maturation, as well as interfering with the induction phase of T lymphocyte responses.",PMC6443931,PMC6443931_3
"The study confirmed the role of il-1ra as a key immunosuppressor during the course of prrsv infection, which supports the notion that il-1ra is, in part, responsible for negative immune responses in the prrsv-infected pigs.",PMC6443931,PMC6443931_4
