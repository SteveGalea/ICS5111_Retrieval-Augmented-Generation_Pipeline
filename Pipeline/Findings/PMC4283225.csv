"The study identified 11 potential human microRNAs (miRNAs) with significant sequence identity to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) genome, out of which 10 have not been previously associated with any function in humans or other animals. These miRNAs, including hsa-miR-628-5p, hsa-miR-18a-3p, and hsa-miR-332-3p, have been linked to various diseases such as cancers, cardiovascular disease, schizophrenia, psoriasis, and primary muscular disorders.",PMC4283225,PMC4283225_0
"The study found that the miRNA hsa-miR-628-5p, which is associated with most common brain cancer glioma, acts as a protective factor during glioma progression, and its expression decreases gradually as the cancer progresses.",PMC4283225,PMC4283225_1
"Another miRNA, hsa-miR-18a-3p, is unregulated in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin compared with non-lesional skin, and its target genes are predominantly involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion during the process of malignant transformation.",PMC4283225,PMC4283225_2
"The study also found that hsa-miR-332-3p is linked to idiopathic prion disease and its upregulation may be a general phenomenon in late-stage prion disease, which could potentially be used as a novel marker for animal and human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).",PMC4283225,PMC4283225_3
"The findings suggest that the identified miRNAs, including hsa-miR-628-5p, hsa-miR-6804-3p, hsa-miR-4289, hsa-miR-208a-3p, hsa-miR-510-3p, hsa-miR-18a-3p, hsa-miR-329-3p, hsa-miR-548ax, hsa-miR-3934-5p, hsa-miR-4474-5p, hsa-",PMC4283225,PMC4283225_4
