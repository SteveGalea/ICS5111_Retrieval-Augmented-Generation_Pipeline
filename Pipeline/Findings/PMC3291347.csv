"A large-scale survey conducted in Hong Kong during the summers of 2003 and 2004 identified coronavirus-related viral genomic rna in 37 bats, representing a prevalence of 12%. Among the 64 published studies involving bat coronaviruses, no researchers were able to isolate live virus from any of the swab samples collected despite the use of many different cell lines and the presence of high levels of viral genetic materials shown by quantitative PCR. This suggests that the majority of bat coronaviruses discovered so far seem to be species-specific, and different bat species from a similar location harbor different coronaviruses.",PMC3291347,PMC3291347_0
"A study conducted in Hong Kong during November 2004 to March 2006 collected samples from 985 bats: 35 species in 14 genera and 3 families at 82 different sites in 15 provinces. Among the 64 published studies involving bat coronaviruses, no researchers were able to isolate live virus from any of the swab samples collected despite the use of many different cell lines and the presence of high levels of viral genetic materials shown by quantitative PCR. Among the 64 pcr-positive products sequenced, only 3 (all from the genus Rhinolophus) were clustered with known bat sars-like–covs (or group 2b), 40 belonged to group 1, and the remaining 22 formed a separate cluster in group 2, most likely clustering with the group 2c viruses reported by Woo et al. (2012).",PMC3291347,PMC3291347_1
