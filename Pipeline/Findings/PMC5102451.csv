"The study identified a novel nidovirus, shingleback nidovirus 1, associated with severe respiratory disease in wild shingleback lizards (Tiliqua rugosa) in Western Australia.",PMC5102451,PMC5102451_0
"The virus is related to the recently discovered ball python nidovirus and python nidovirus, which are also associated with severe respiratory disease.",PMC5102451,PMC5102451_1
The study found that the similarity across the pp1ab between shingleback nidovirus 1 and the python nidoviruses is greater than that between shingleback nidovirus 1 and members of the bafinivirus and torovirus genera.,PMC5102451,PMC5102451_2
"The study found that rt-pcr positive individuals were not necessarily cases of respiratory disease, highlighting the potential for false negatives due to an unknown incubation period, shedding rates, and routes, and the need for further investigation into bacterial species in affected and unaffected individuals.",PMC5102451,PMC5102451_3
"The study highlights the importance of ongoing collaborative arrangements between researchers and wildlife rehabilitation centres in detecting and describing emerging wildlife diseases and monitoring of existing diseases, as well as the need for further investigation into the distribution and impact of the virus in wild shingleback lizards and related genera.",PMC5102451,PMC5102451_4
