"Sp-a and sp-d, two innate immune defence proteins produced by the lung, have been shown to play a key role in the clearance of viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and influenza virus.",PMC6738215,PMC6738215_0
"Both sp-a and sp-d have been shown to be essential for maintaining a non-inflamed environment within the lungs by balancing the immune system, avoiding excessive inflammation or autoimmune responses.",PMC6738215,PMC6738215_1
"The trimeric structure of sp-a and sp-d allows for their broad selectivity, allowing them to recognise and competitively bind structurally similar trimeric viral fusion proteins, preventing their attachment to the host cell and neutralising the virus while enhancing its clearance from the body.",PMC6738215,PMC6738215_2
"The dual function of these collectins could be of particular advantage when considering therapeutics for inflammatory lung diseases, such as severe asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, where there is a deficiency in the level of sp-d in the lungs.",PMC6738215,PMC6738215_3
"Sp-a and sp-d are innate immune defence proteins that are structurally similar to the viral fusion proteins that they selectively bind, and have the potential to be exploited for the development of novel, anti-infective, and immune-modulatory therapeutics.",PMC6738215,PMC6738215_4
