"Using data from high-income countries only, the study estimated approximately 3,263 severe mers cases in source countries, with Saudi Arabia having the largest number (2,269).",PMC5038414,PMC5038414_2
The study's sensitivity analyses showed that estimates of epidemic size that incorporated data from lower-income countries were 60% lower than estimates obtained by using data from high-income countries alone.,PMC5038414,PMC5038414_3
The study's results are consistent with improvements in surveillance practices across source countries during 2014 and add information by focusing on severe infections and providing more up-to-date information.,PMC5038414,PMC5038414_4
