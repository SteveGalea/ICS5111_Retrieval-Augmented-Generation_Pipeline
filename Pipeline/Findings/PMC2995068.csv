"Nsp13 helicase, belonging to the non-processive family, exhibits substantial processivity in unwinding duplex nucleic acids in vitro through functional cooperativity rather than structural contacts between helicase monomers.",PMC2995068,PMC2995068_0
"The length of the ss region at the 5'-side of the dna duplex is a major determinant for the efficiency of dna unwinding by nsp13, as unwinding of longer substrates is facilitated by functional cooperativity of multiple nsp13 monomers loaded on the same ssDNA track.",PMC2995068,PMC2995068_1
Nsp13 helicase more efficiently unwinds partial-duplex nucleic acid substrates containing ss regions at the 5'-side that are long enough to allow the binding of multiple monomers.,PMC2995068,PMC2995068_2
"Chemical cross-linking assay shows that oligomerization of nsp13 is an intrinsic property of the protein, which is facilitated in the presence of long ssDNA and ATP.",PMC2995068,PMC2995068_3
"Nsp13 helicase has a higher degree of cross-linking in the presence of longer ssDNA and ATP, suggesting that a dynamic oligomeric status of the helicase might exist in the presence of ssDNA.",PMC2995068,PMC2995068_4
