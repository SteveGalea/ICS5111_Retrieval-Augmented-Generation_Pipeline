"The study found no significant overall associations between selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and invasive aspergillus (IA) infection, but the best result was the association of the interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) rs12203592 SNP with an increased risk of IA in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant patients, suggesting a weak effect of this locus on the risk of IA in HSC patients that might become evident only in those patients with a more profound degree of immunosuppression.",PMC4982195,PMC4982195_0
"The study did not provide strong evidence of a relationship between polymorphisms within nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) 1, NFKB2, CREB (CREL), RELB (RELB), and IRF4 genes and IA risk, but given the limited statistical power of the HSC-stratified analysis and the evidences suggesting a functional role of the IRF4rs12203592 SNP, further evaluation of whether the IRF4 locus may have a role in determining the susceptibility to IA in larger HSC populations is warranted.",PMC4982195,PMC4982195_1
"The study found a small effect of common haplotypes on IA risk, but the magnitude of these effects suggested that the observed association was likely due to the IRF4rs12203592 SNP rather than the combined effect of the IRF4 SNPs.",PMC4982195,PMC4982195_2
The study did not observe any consistent interaction model that could affect the risk of developing IA.,PMC4982195,PMC4982195_3
"The study was supported by grants from several funding sources, including the Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias, the Era-Net Pathogenomics, the Austrian Science Fundation, and the Portuguese Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, among others. However, the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.",PMC4982195,PMC4982195_4
