Exercising at 3 metabolic equivalents (METs) while wearing an N95 mask reduced tidal volume by 23.0% and minute ventilation by 25.8% in pregnant women.,PMC4647822,PMC4647822_0
Breathing through an N95 mask during low-intensity work (3 METs) reduced expired oxygen concentration by 3.2% and increased expired carbon dioxide by 8.9%.,PMC4647822,PMC4647822_1
"Breathing through an N95 mask did not change maternal or fetal heart rates, capillary lactate levels, oxygen saturation, or rating of perceived exertion at a work intensity of 3 METs.",PMC4647822,PMC4647822_2
Using an N95 mask during low-intensity work imposed an additional workload on the metabolic system of pregnant healthcare workers.,PMC4647822,PMC4647822_3
The study suggests that the benefits of using an N95 mask to prevent serious emerging infectious diseases should be weighed against the potential respiratory consequences associated with extended N95 respirator usage in pregnant healthcare workers.,PMC4647822,PMC4647822_4
