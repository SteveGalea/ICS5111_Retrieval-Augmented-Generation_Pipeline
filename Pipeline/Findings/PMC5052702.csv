The study identified 12 electrophilic probes and 20 nucleophilic fragments as potential inhibitors of the 3C protease of coxsackie virus B3.,PMC5052702,PMC5052702_0
"The inhibitory activity of the electrophilic probes was amplified by the nucleophilic fragments, resulting in irreversible inhibition.",PMC5052702,PMC5052702_1
The study used a template-assisted assembly approach to identify the most potent inhibitors.,PMC5052702,PMC5052702_2
The initial phases of the crystal structure of the protease-inhibitor complex were obtained using molecular replacement with the previously solved 3C protease structure as a search model.,PMC5052702,PMC5052702_3
"The study used a detailed binding confirmation approach for inhibitors through ligand docking, protein data bank, and the plp scoring function with 25 ga runs per ligand in the most accurate mode without water molecules and default parameter settings.",PMC5052702,PMC5052702_4
