"Fleximers, a new class of nucleoside analogues, were found to exhibit potent antiviral activity against a variety of viruses, including herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C, Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika viruses, due to their ability to sample more of the binding site and engage in secondary interactions with the enzymes, leading to selective inhibition.",PMC5890542,PMC5890542_0
"Fleximers, by reversing the connectivity of the base and sugar moieties, were found to be recognized by both purine and pyrimidine metabolizing enzymes, leading to potential antiparasitic and anticancer activity.",PMC5890542,PMC5890542_1
"Fleximers, by incorporating modified sugars found in FDA-approved nucleoside therapeutics, were found to exhibit potent activity against human coronaviruses, dengue, and yellow fever viruses, highlighting the importance of understanding the selectivity of these unique nucleosides.",PMC5890542,PMC5890542_2
"Fleximers, by utilizing an enzymatic transglycosylation approach, were found to prefer a co-planar arrangement, leading to their selectivity rather than indiscriminate activity.",PMC5890542,PMC5890542_3
"Fleximers, by employing a wide range of substituted benzene rings instead of the typical ribose sugar, were found to exhibit excellent activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis, highlighting the potential of these unique nucleosides to target biologically significant enzymes.",PMC5890542,PMC5890542_4
