"In response to increased extreme precipitation events attributed to climate change, the risk of water- and food-borne illnesses will likely increase due to alterations in existing conditions governing human-mosquito interactions in large parts of the United States.",PMC1570072,PMC1570072_0
"Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation events attributed to climate change will generally increase the incidence of rodent-borne illnesses, particularly hantavirus, due to alterations in existing conditions governing human-rodent interactions in large parts of the United States.",PMC1570072,PMC1570072_1
"Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation events attributed to climate change will generally increase the incidence of tick-borne illnesses, particularly Lyme disease, due to alterations in existing conditions governing human-tick interactions in large parts of the United States.",PMC1570072,PMC1570072_2
"Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation events attributed to climate change will generally increase the incidence of food-borne illnesses, particularly salmonellosis infections, due to alterations in existing conditions governing food production, storage, and preparation recommendations in large parts of the United States.",PMC1570072,PMC1570072_3
"Increases in ambient temperatures attributed to climate change will generally decrease the susceptibility of the United States population to epidemics, assuming increased amounts of time will be spent indoors in air-conditioned environments. However, the potential for population explosions and crashes that could increase disease risk in large parts of the United States due to alterations in existing conditions governing human-mosquito interactions cannot be excluded.",PMC1570072,PMC1570072_4
