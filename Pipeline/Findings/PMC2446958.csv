"The sars-cov protein 6 interacts with cellular factors involved in nuclear protein import, preventing their entry into the nucleus and suppressing antiviral responses. This function of protein 6 is provided by its n-terminal hydrophobic portion, and its central activity is largely independent of effects on the virus.",PMC2446958,PMC2446958_0
"Reducing importin-β levels in cells using sirnas specific for importin-β mRNAs can functionally replace the c-terminal residues of protein 6, arguing for a bifunctional accelerator of mhv growth with major contributions from the n-terminal residues and independent contributions from the c-terminal residues once protein 6 levels are sufficiently high to achieve titration of nuclear import factors.",PMC2446958,PMC2446958_1
"Disrupting classical nuclear import pathways can modestly improve mhv replication, as nuclear transport machinery controls the bidirectional transport of many biologically important molecules, and these pathways must be maintained for host cells to mount effective antiviral responses.",PMC2446958,PMC2446958_2
The distribution of proteins in cell nuclei and cytosol might be globally altered by protein 6 in ways that create superior environments for the replication of coronaviruses.,PMC2446958,PMC2446958_3
"The c-terminal portion of protein 6 can sequester importin-β, a crucial protein carrier, from nuclear entry, which can limit the nuclear accumulation of 3xgfp-sv40 nls and enhance the production of infectious mhvs, to levels about 5-fold above those generated by control sirnas.",PMC2446958,PMC2446958_4
