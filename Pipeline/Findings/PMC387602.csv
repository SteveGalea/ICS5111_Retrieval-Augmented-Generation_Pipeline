"All seven assays developed for the detection of SARS-CoV RNA demonstrated similar sensitivities and specificities, with sensitivities ranging from 83.3% to 100% and specificities ranging from 94% to 100%.",PMC387602,PMC387602_0
"The two most sensitive assays, assays 7 and 6, had analytical sensitivities that were 166 and 16 times higher, respectively, than the other assays, as determined by probit regression analysis using dilutions for 50% detection.",PMC387602,PMC387602_1
"The costs of performing each assay, including the costs of both reagents and technologist's time, ranged from $5.46 to $9.81 CDN per test, with the least expensive being the two-step ChB assays and the most expensive being the two-step LC assay.",PMC387602,PMC387602_2
"The commercial assay had a cost of $40.37 per test, which may be reduced with contract purchasing.",PMC387602,PMC387602_3
"Laboratories setting up SARS-CoV PCR testing for the first time without pedigreed specimens and controls can choose between various PCR assay formats and have an assay suited to their specific needs and instrumentation that will provide good sensitivity and specificity, with the use of a second confirmatory PCR with a different amplification target providing laboratories with some assurance that specimens giving positive PCR results are true positives.",PMC387602,PMC387602_4
