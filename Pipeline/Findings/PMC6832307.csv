"During the 2013-2016 outbreak of EVD, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its guidelines regarding precautions to prevent the transmission of EVD in healthcare settings. The updated guidelines emphasized the use of standard personal protective equipment (PPE) and airborne infection isolation rooms, as well as the use of eye protection and N95 or higher respirators when performing aerosol-generating procedures, such as manual ventilation and bronchoscopy, on EVD patients.",PMC6832307,PMC6832307_0
The CDC also made similar recommendations for MERS-CoV during an interim guidance period.,PMC6832307,PMC6832307_1
"The ambiguity of which procedures and viruses require additional protective measures during aerosol-generating procedures, such as the use of surgical masks or unfitted N95 respirators, which do not provide proper protection, has led to breaches in protocol during many nosocomial transmission events.",PMC6832307,PMC6832307_2
Proper patient triage and diagnosis are the first steps to ensuring that precautions are undertaken when performing aerosol-generating procedures.,PMC6832307,PMC6832307_3
"More evidence of nosocomial transmission events of emerging viruses, such as Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), and other viruses, as well as procedures, such as bronchoscopy, is likely to prompt future guidelines.",PMC6832307,PMC6832307_4
"While on-site sampling for viruses during aerosol-generating procedures can provide clinically relevant data, such as the quantity, concentration, travel distance, and size of aerosols formed during agmps, determining the risks of certain viruses and procedures is essential, and communicating their respective precautions and providing resources is equally important.",PMC6832307,PMC6832307_5
Proper patient triage and diagnosis are crucial for ensuring that precautions are undertaken when performing aerosol-generating procedures.,PMC6832307,PMC6832307_6
"The risks of certain viruses and procedures, such as bronchoscopy, are likely to be significant, and emerging viruses or novel procedures may also play significant roles.",PMC6832307,PMC6832307_7
"More research and communication about the risks of certain viruses and procedures, as well as their respective precautions, are necessary to resolve the uncertainty surrounding their role in nosocomial virus transmission and aerosol-generating procedures.",PMC6832307,PMC6832307_8
