"The Ebola virus disease outbreaks in Africa have presented challenges and opportunities in responding to emerging infectious diseases, including neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) prevention, control, and management, as well as health system coverage and service delivery bottlenecks. These challenges and opportunities have included widespread ignorance, lack of knowledge, and potential panic over Ebola virus disease, resulting in trepidation, isolation, dignity impoundment, stigmatization, and ostracism from associated socio-ecological and public health consequences.",PMC4130433,PMC4130433_1
"To combat Ebola virus disease outbreaks and other emerging infectious diseases, there is an urgent need for accelerating the response through the provision of minimum essential information on risk communication for behavioral impact, developmental communication and health promotion/education personnel and communities, working in multidisciplinary teams to respond to the disease outbreaks. This includes harnessing all stakeholders' collaboration, communication, and networking, including communities, to improve community participation, informal and formal health education, ownership, and empowerment of the programs and to ensure human rights for all ages at all levels.",PMC4130433,PMC4130433_2
"The development of new tools, strategies, and approaches, such as improved diagnostics, novel therapies including vaccines, is needed to prevent, control, and contain Ebola virus disease and other emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS, bird flu, Lassa fever, Dengue, and MERS outbreaks.",PMC4130433,PMC4130433_3
"Developing surveillance response systems against emerging infectious diseases and controlling and eliminating NTDs, as well as early warning and emergency systems, cannot be overemphasized. Concerted actions to empower communities",PMC4130433,PMC4130433_4
