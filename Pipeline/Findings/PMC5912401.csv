"This study identified a high degree of genetic polymorphism among S. aureus isolates recovered from different environments, with an average of 2.5 allelic substitutions detected in every 100 loci from a common ancestral strain.",PMC5912401,PMC5912401_0
"The study found that highly related S. aureus strains can emerge or remain in clinical microenvironments over prolonged periods of time, possibly due to horizontal/vertical spreading of such strains.",PMC5912401,PMC5912401_1
The study revealed that S. aureus strains can survive on dry surfaces for an average of 5 days and can be transmitted between patients and dental staff via clinical environments.,PMC5912401,PMC5912401_2
"The study found that the dental clinic environment is an appropriate setting for S. aureus cross-transmission, with the highest level of contamination observed on gloved hands and the auxiliary table and storeroom, located at the center of the clinic.",PMC5912401,PMC5912401_3
The study highlighted the need for strategies to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains in dental settings and emphasized the importance of applying infection control guidelines and published research related to dental infection control principles and practices.,PMC5912401,PMC5912401_4
