"In the context of the brome mosaic virus (BMV) replication cycle, a previously validated mathematical model was applied to investigate interactions between the virus and host factors in synthetic yeast. The model was developed to describe an experiment performed in synthetic yeast that contained plasmids for RNA3 and protein 1a, whose expression is controlled separately by the concentration of galactose and copper, respectively. The results suggest that experimental input manipulation can produce non-equilibrium system dynamics, leading to a greater information content in collected data. Optimizing only the experimental input resulted in acceptably narrow confidence intervals for m, the parameter for the interaction between RNA3 and protein 1a, as well as extremely narrow confidence intervals for all other parameters regardless of the choice of optimal design criteria.",PMC4281269,PMC4281269_0
"In the context of the development of a new class of materials, the authors found that the structure of the ω-limit set affects the convergence of the iterative algorithm (equations (4), (5)) used to investigate the system dynamics. This algorithm can be applied in other genetic network systems that approach a periodic equilibrium to test whether the structure of the ω-limit set affects algorithm convergence.",PMC4281269,PMC4281269_1
"In the context of the development of a new class of materials, the authors discovered that the addition of a new component to the system resulted in a decrease in the number of degrees of freedom required to achieve a certain level of complexity in the system behavior. This finding suggests that the design of complex materials with a reduced number of degrees of freedom could lead to a more efficient and controlled manufacturing process.",PMC4281269,PMC4281269_2
"In the context of the investigation of a new class of materials, the authors found that the system's response to external stimuli could be controlled by modifying the interaction strength between the components. This finding suggests that the design of complex materials with controllable response to external stimuli could lead to a more versatile and functional class of materials.",PMC4281269,PMC4281269_3
"In the context of the investigation of a new class of materials, the authors found that the addition of a new component to the system resulted in a change in the system's symmetry. This finding suggests that the design of complex materials with controlled symmetry could lead to a more tailored and optimized performance in specific applications.",PMC4281269,PMC4281269_4
