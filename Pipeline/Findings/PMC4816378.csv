"A scarlet fever epidemic occurred in Beijing, China, in 2011, with an emm12-predominant type of group A Streptococcus (GAS) strains.",PMC4816378,PMC4816378_0
"The epidemic was characterized by a high resistance rate to erythromycin, tetracycline, and clindamycin among GAS isolates, possibly due to the overuse of antimicrobial drugs in humans and animals in China.",PMC4816378,PMC4816378_1
"Almost all GAS isolates from the 2011 Beijing epidemic harbored the superantigen spec, and ssa became the primary superantigen of emm1 and emm12 isolates.",PMC4816378,PMC4816378_2
The level of GAS resistance to clindamycin was lower than that to erythromycin and tetracycline among isolates in China and other countries.,PMC4816378,PMC4816378_3
"The epidemic peaked in early summer, possibly because in early summer, compared with winter, each year an emm type that is relatively new to young children sweeps through a population of children that does not have an effective level of population immunity.",PMC4816378,PMC4816378_4
