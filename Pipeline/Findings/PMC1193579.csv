"The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is a permissive host for hmpv replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, with peak virus titers of 103.6 pfu/g in the nasal turbinates and 104.4 pfu/g in the lungs on day 4 postinfection.",PMC1193579,PMC1193579_0
"Hmpv infection in cotton rats is associated with significant inflammation in the lower respiratory tract, including disruption of the epithelial architecture, sloughing of epithelial cells, loss of ciliation, and presence of inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.",PMC1193579,PMC1193579_1
"The cotton rat model of hmpv infection is sensitive to virus replication, with high titers of virus in both nose and lungs, and provides an appropriate animal model to study the pathogenesis of hmpv and the immune response to the virus.",PMC1193579,PMC1193579_2
"The cotton rat model is also useful to measure the effects of vaccines or prophylactic antibodies on virus replication and histopathology, as it allows for the use of cotton rat-specific immunologic and molecular reagents that are commercially available.",PMC1193579,PMC1193579_3
The cotton rat model of hmpv infection is less permissive for rsv replication than cotton rats but may still be appropriate when particular immune mechanisms can be studied only in a murine system because of transgenic or knockout technologies or reagent availability.,PMC1193579,PMC1193579_4
