"Cardiac arrest occurs in 1.4 per 10,000 pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia, with medication-related and cardiovascular causes accounting for 69% of all arrests.",PMC5386604,PMC5386604_0
"In the pediatric population, airway events with hypoxemia remain the most common etiology of bradycardia, but negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of anesthesia and medications, such as propofol and sevoflurane, can lead to profound hemodynamic changes.",PMC5386604,PMC5386604_1
"Spinal anesthesia is a suitable alternative to general anesthesia in high-risk pediatric patients due to its remarkable cardiovascular stability, which has been well documented.",PMC5386604,PMC5386604_2
"Spinal anesthesia is appropriate in many cases where avoidance of general anesthesia is desired, regardless of the reason, as it provides intraoperative hemodynamic stability, effective surgical anesthesia, patient immobility, and adequate operating conditions without the use of neuromuscular blocking agents.",PMC5386604,PMC5386604_3
"The potential for hemodynamic changes should always be considered and appropriate monitoring employed with ready access to resuscitation medications if needed, but the reflex response to high spinal anesthesia is primarily diminished parasympathetic tone that offsets the blockade of sympathetic function in infants and children less than 6 years old.",PMC5386604,PMC5386604_4
