"The PowerChek MERS assay, developed by Kogene Biotech, has been approved by the China National Drug Administration (CNDA) and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) in South Korea for the rapid and specific diagnosis of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",PMC5587821,PMC5587821_0
"The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, evaluated the analytical sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and diagnostic performance of the PowerChek MERS assay, which targets the UreA Polymerase (UPE) and Open Reading Frame 1a (ORF1a) regions.",PMC5587821,PMC5587821_1
"The study used 100 clinical specimens, including 50 from MERS-confirmed patients and 50 from MERS-negative individuals, to compare the results of the PowerChek MERS assay with those of nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and nucleocapsid (N) genes.",PMC5587821,PMC5587821_2
"Both methods gave concordant results for all 100 specimens, with a kappa value of 1.00, and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the PowerChek MERS assay were both 100% (95% confidence interval, 91.1â€“100%).",PMC5587821,PMC5587821_3
"The PowerChek MERS assay has good diagnostic performance for detecting MERS-CoV RNA, and its simplicity and efficiency reduce the workload required for diagnosis, making it a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of MERS and controlling MERS outbreaks. However, further studies are needed to evaluate its performance using other specimen types and real-time PCR platforms.",PMC5587821,PMC5587821_4
