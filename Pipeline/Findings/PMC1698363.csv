"The rt-lamp assay reported in this study is a simple diagnostic tool that allows rapid and real-time detection of Japanese encephalitis (JEV) in clinical specimens. It involves a single-tube accelerated reaction carried out by mixing the buffer, primers, reverse transcriptase, and DNA polymerase and incubating the mixture at 63Â°C for 60 minutes. This method has higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) due to continuous amplification under isothermal conditions using six primers that recognize eight distinct regions of the target.",PMC1698363,PMC1698363_0
"The rt-lamp assay has the advantage of reaction simplicity and detection sensitivity compared to RT-PCR and real-time PCR. The higher amplification efficiency of the rt-lamp reaction yields a large amount of a by-product, pyrophosphate ion, leading to white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate in the reaction mixture. Since the increase in turbidity of the reaction mixture according to the production of precipitate correlates with the amount of DNA synthesized, real-time monitoring of the rt-lamp reaction can be achieved by real-time measurement of turbidity.",PMC1698363,PMC1698363_1
"The rt-lamp assay allows rapid, real-time detection and quantification of JEV in acute-phase CSF samples without requiring sophisticated equipment. It has potential usefulness for clinical diagnosis and surveillance of JEV in developing countries due to the substantial reduction in time required for confirmation of results compared to conventional RT-PCR.",PMC1698363,PMC1698363_2
"Retrospective analysis of clinical samples positive by rt-lamp revealed the presence of virus-specific IgM antibodies in corresponding CSF samples, suggesting confirmatory infection. The rt-lamp assay has demonstrated a higher sensitivity by correctly detecting nine additional positive samples with low levels of virus that were missed by RT-PCR. These may be the samples collected during the window period of the disease, where the viremia is in decline and the IgM antibody started appearing to a detectable limit. The rt-lamp assay has potential for the detection of low-level virus in clinical specimens, which is crucial for the early diagnosis of viral infections.",PMC1698363,PMC1698363_3
