"Case report: A 61-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and hypogammaglobulinemia presented with shortness of breath and a 4-week history of cough. He received oral corticosteroids but died 6 days later due to progressive pneumonia caused by Candida albicans.",PMC3811645,PMC3811645_0
"Autopsy findings: HBV1, a newly discovered respiratory disease-causing pathogen, was present in very high copy numbers in the patient's trachea, nasopharynx, and blood. Rhinovirus and Epstein-Barr virus were also detected. Antibodies against HBV1 were not detected, possibly due to secondary hypogammaglobulinemia.",PMC3811645,PMC3811645_1
"Virus prevalence: More than 94% of adults have antibodies against HBV1-4, with a seroprevalence of 60% against HBV1.",PMC3811645,PMC3811645_2
"Clinical outcomes: HBV1 infection is increasingly recognized as a cause of respiratory infections worldwide, and recent studies provide evidence that HBV1 may cause encephalitis, life-threatening complications, and fatal coinfections, particularly in children and immunocompromised individuals.",PMC3811645,PMC3811645_3
"Coinfections: HBV1 dna-positive subjects have a high coinfection rate, up to 83% in respiratory samples, with other viruses, which may influence the clinical effects of HBV1 infection, particularly during immunosuppression or advanced age.",PMC3811645,PMC3811645_4
