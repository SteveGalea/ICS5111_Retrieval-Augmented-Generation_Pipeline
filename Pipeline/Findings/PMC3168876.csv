"In the study, the authors found that the human protein BZIP TF ANXA2 interacts with a pseudoknot structure in the 3' untranslated region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomic RNA. This interaction is important for efficient HIV-1 replication and is mediated by the HIV-1 accessory protein REV.",PMC3168876,PMC3168876_0
"The authors also found that ANXA2 is a host cell factor required for efficient HIV-1 replication, and that ANXA2 expression enhances HIV-1 replication in both T and non-T cell lines.",PMC3168876,PMC3168876_1
"In addition, the study identified two different siRNA sequences targeting the ANXA2 mRNA, which can be used to knock down ANXA2 expression in cells.",PMC3168876,PMC3168876_2
"The authors also developed a dual luciferase reporter system to study the role of ANXA2 in HIV-1 replication, which allows for the simultaneous measurement of the activity of both the wild-type and mutant HIV-1 luciferase reporters in cells.",PMC3168876,PMC3168876_3
"The study also provided insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 frameshifting, a process by which a single open reading frame can be used to translate two or more proteins from a single mRNA molecule. The authors found that a frameshifting sequence is amplified from a specific region of the HIV-1 genomic RNA, and that this process is important for efficient HIV-1 replication.",PMC3168876,PMC3168876_4
