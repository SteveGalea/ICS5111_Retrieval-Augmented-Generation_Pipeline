"The study provides evidence for homologous recombination (HR) in negative-sense RNA viruses, specifically in hantaviruses, through the generation and spread of advantageous genetic combinations and the purging function attributed to HR, i.e. recombination between homologous parental molecules through crossover at homologous sites.",PMC552329,PMC552329_0
"The study reports the first evidence for HR in negative-sense RNA viruses, specifically in hantaviruses, through the identification of a mosaic-like structure of the s RNA segment and the n protein of tula hantavirus (TULV), which is formed by a relatively long hairpin-like structure within the ""hot-spot"" between nt 332 and nt 368 in the s RNA segment.",PMC552329,PMC552329_1
"The study shows that HR occurs in hantavirus, which is maintained in nature in persistent infection in natural host species, resulting in the formation of a recombinant virus, which presents no real match to the original cell adapted variant and has a stable genotype, as observed in the case of rectulv, which forms foci similar in size to those of the original variant, tulv02, and grows to similar titers.",PMC552329,PMC552329_2
"The study reveals that the survival time of the recombinant virus, in this case rectulv, in the presence of the parental virus, tulv02, is sufficient for transmission of a recombinant virus, in a hypothetical in vivo situation, from one rodent to another, as observed in the case of hantavirus.",PMC552329,PMC552329_3
"The study suggests that the hairpin-like structure formed by a highly conserved inverted repeat in the 3'-noncoding region of the s RNA segment of tulv, which presents obstacles for sliding of the viral RNA polymerase along the template, might be involved in HR events, as observed in the case of puumala hantavirus.",PMC552329,PMC552329_4
