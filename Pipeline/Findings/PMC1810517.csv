"The study found that the feline receptor fapn is not a functional receptor for ibv entry, as ibv-infected bhk-21 cells did not show an increase in viral infectivity for any ibv strain, despite the expression of fapn on bhk-21 cell surface.",PMC1810517,PMC1810517_0
"The study found that ibv cannot utilize feline apn (fapn) as a functional receptor, as primary chicken kidney cells (ckc) infected with ibv did not show an increase in viral infectivity for any ibv strain, despite the expression of fapn on bhk-21 cell surface.",PMC1810517,PMC1810517_1
"The study found that ibv-infected bhk cells did not show an increase in viral infectivity for any ibv strain, despite the expression of fapn on bhk-21 cell surface.",PMC1810517,PMC1810517_2
"The study found that ibv-infected bhk cells did not show an increase in viral infectivity for any ibv strain, despite the expression of fapn on bhk-21 cell surface and the presence of fapn in chicken apn (capn) and human apn (hapn) in chicken kidney cells (ckc) infected with ibv.",PMC1810517,PMC1810517_3
"The study found that chicken apn (capn) and human apn (hapn) in chicken kidney cells (ckc) infected with ibv did not show an increase in viral infectivity for any ibv strain, despite the presence of fapn in chicken apn (capn) and human apn (hapn) in chicken kidney cells (ckc) infected with ibv.",PMC1810517,PMC1810517_4
