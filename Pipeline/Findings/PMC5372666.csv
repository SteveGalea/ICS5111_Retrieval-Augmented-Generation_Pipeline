"The study found a relationship between coinfection with other viral agents and severity of rsv disease, but this association was not significant. This may be explained, in part, by the older age of the coinfected group.",PMC5372666,PMC5372666_0
"The study confirmed the alternating dominance of rsv-a and rsv-b antigenic groups during winter outbreaks in Santiago, Chile, in agreement with previous studies. However, no association was found between the rsv antigenic group or genotype and clinical severity.",PMC5372666,PMC5372666_1
The study found that a delayed viral clearance might be associated with greater airway injury and disease severity.,PMC5372666,PMC5372666_2
"The study suggests that a delayed viral clearance might contribute to greater airway injury and disease severity, as new antiviral drug therapies hold the promise of shortening the clearance of rsv in the respiratory tract and thus might mitigate severity of disease.",PMC5372666,PMC5372666_3
"The study found that higher viral loads were found when sampling occurred earlier during the respiratory illness, but this was only significant for hmpv and not for rsv.",PMC5372666,PMC5372666_4
