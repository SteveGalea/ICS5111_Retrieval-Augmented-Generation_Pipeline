"MHV enters progenitor oligodendrocyte CG-4 cells but restricts viral replication and prevents cell death, resulting in persistent, nonproductive infection.",PMC538726,PMC538726_0
"Overexpression of the cellular survival gene BCL-XL in MHV-infected CG-4 cells converts acute infection to persistent, nonproductive infection and prevents cell death.",PMC538726,PMC538726_1
"Infectious MHV is not recovered from CG-4 cells beyond two passages, indicating that MHV persistence in CG-4 cells is nonproductive.",PMC538726,PMC538726_2
"Viral genomic RNA sequences are consistently amplified from persistently infected CG-4 cells, suggesting that downregulation of viral gene expression and function is an important mechanism for viral persistence in CG-4 cells.",PMC538726,PMC538726_3
"MHV persistence in CG-4 cells is likely controlled by intracellular factors rather than by neutralizing antibodies, as observed in MHV-infected B-cell-deficient mice, where neutralizing antibodies prevent reinfection but do not severely block intracellular virus replication.",PMC538726,PMC538726_4
