"In a study conducted in South Korea during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, a pre-hospital triage system was implemented at a large tertiary medical center's emergency department (ED). The study found that the isolation level determined based on the triage system was moderately well correlated with the isolation level required by the final diagnosis.",PMC5546975,PMC5546975_0
"Of the 4,128 ED patients screened during the study period, 97 (23%) were diagnosed with a contagious disease requiring isolation, and 74 (76%) of these patients were isolated.",PMC5546975,PMC5546975_1
"The study found that patients with a transplant history were more likely to have a contagious disease requiring isolation, but they were less likely to have fever or leukocytosis compared to patients with non-contagious diseases.",PMC5546975,PMC5546975_2
"The study also found that during the study period, 3 of the 114 patients who were moved to the resuscitation zone died in the ED. This highlights the need for special medical resources, such as computed tomography, to be available or applied early in the screening process to prevent clinical deterioration during screening.",PMC5546975,PMC5546975_3
"The study found that maintaining a separate screening system outside the ED requires considerable personnel and financial resources, as the ED screening process was activated every 2 hours, and the screening process was focused on contagious diseases, which may not be feasible for most hospitals.",PMC5546975,PMC5546975_4
