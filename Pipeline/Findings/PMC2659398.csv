"This study demonstrates that the cgmmv vector has a preference for read-through codon signals, specifically the leaky uag codon. Chimeric cgmmv transcripts utilizing this signal were not infectious, but a chimeric cgmmv carrying a read-through sequence from the wild-type cgmmv genome was infectious.",PMC2659398,PMC2659398_0
"This study also suggests that there is a preference for read-through codon signals between different species of tobamoviruses, as the leaky uag codon utilized by cgmmv is the same as the one used by tmv, the closest genome similarity to cgmmv. However, the study shows that the efficiency of the leaky uag codon for tmv is not high, as transcripts utilizing this signal for tmv were not infectious.",PMC2659398,PMC2659398_1
"This study shows that the order of removal of the transgene from a chimeric virus in a natural host is speculated to be the 5' to 3' direction. Two additional nucleotides, together with the read-through sequence ""cc-aaa-tag,"" were detected downstream from the cgmmv cp orf.",PMC2659398,PMC2659398_2
"The study shows that the efficiency of the leaky uag codon for the chimeric cgmmv transcripts utilizing this signal was relatively high, giving a ratio of modified to unmodified cp of approximately 1:1. This is further supported by the detection of relatively equal yield of chimeric and wild-type cgmmv cp.",PMC2659398,PMC2659398_3
"This study provides a rational harvesting timeline for the chimeric virus carrying inserted foreign peptides, making this system exploitable for implementation in a plantation scale in the future. The study suggests that once host plants are infected with the chimeric virus carrying inserted foreign peptides, the optimum harvesting time would be at around 14 dpi or not more than 20 dpi in order to obtain maximum yield of the full-length transgene. Growth of the infected plants for longer periods to obtain higher yields of the chimeric virus may induce unwanted transgene deletions.",PMC2659398,PMC2659398_4
