"The study identified three distinct hepatitis B virus (HBV) species in bats, which share high sequence similarity in key domains required for infection and host tropism.",PMC3791787,PMC3791787_0
"The bat HBV species tupaiid hepatitis B virus (THBV) has a zoonotic potential for humans, as it can infect human hepatoma cells and its surface proteins can mediate infection in a similar manner to HBV.",PMC3791787,PMC3791787_1
"The study found evidence for a zoonotic potential for THBV, as it is capable of infecting human hepatoma cells and is not neutralized by high-titered anti-HBs antibodies from vaccinated individuals, similar to the occasional failure of the standard HBV vaccine against heterologous human HBV genotypes.",PMC3791787,PMC3791787_2
"The study highlights the need for screening of human and nonhuman primate sera from remote tropical areas for bat-associated hepatitis B viruses, as bats can adapt to anthropogenic influence and impose an ongoing risk of zoonotic human infections.",PMC3791787,PMC3791787_3
"The study suggests that future vaccination concepts against HBV may need to integrate considerations of the zoonotic potential of primate and nonprimate hepatitis B viruses, as the genetic distance between bat HBV species and HBV may go undetected in routine serological and molecular screening programs.",PMC3791787,PMC3791787_4
