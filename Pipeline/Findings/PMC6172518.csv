"Over the 8-year period from 2007 to 2014, the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia decreased in children and adolescents in Korea, with the exception of a unique spike in 2011, which is speculated to have resulted from a Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. Pneumoniae) epidemic.",PMC6172518,PMC6172518_0
"During the study period, the prevalence of pleural effusion and empyema also decreased, with the exception of a unique spike in prevalence in 2011, which is speculated to have resulted from the M. Pneumoniae epidemic.",PMC6172518,PMC6172518_1
"The study findings provide evidence of the probable contribution of the pneumococcal vaccination (PCV) program in lowering the risk for pneumonia in children and adolescents, but the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in this study varied greatly with age groups, with those <1 and 13â€“18 years of age showing particularly high ICU admission rates.",PMC6172518,PMC6172518_2
"The study results suggest that prevention of severe interstitial lung disease, vaccination, and health measures are needed more, as bacterial pneumonia and empyema found significant seasonality in December and May, respectively, which is similar to the results of previous studies in other areas of PCV introduction and the cause of seasonality in pneumococcal disease.",PMC6172518,PMC6172518_3
"The findings of this study are limited by the use of NEDIS data, which is based on the diagnoses written in the medical records from the emergency department (ED), as it did not include those who were treated in outpatient clinics or those who were hospitalized through outpatient clinics, and the reliability of diagnosis and treatment may be limited by the proficiency of primary care physicians.",PMC6172518,PMC6172518_4
