"In this study, 26 cases of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) with neurologic signs were investigated, and gross neuropathologic changes were observed in 58% of the cases. Hydrocephalus, a secondary neurologic disease, was the most common gross change, occurring in 38% of the cases.",PMC6505806,PMC6505806_0
"The overall neurohistopathological changes in FIP-affected cats were similar among the cases, but the distribution of these changes varied considerably, regardless of the type of inflammation and the presence or absence of lesions in other organs. Three distinct distributions of neurohistopathological changes were observed: periventricular encephalitis, rhombencephalitis, and diffuse leptomeningitis with superficial encephalitis.",PMC6505806,PMC6505806_1
The histologic changes in the brain of FIP-affected cats were not always reflective of the typical pyogranulomatous pattern attributed to this viral infection. The macrophage population within the lesions was not only composed of epithelioid macrophages but also non-epithelioid macrophages and foamy macrophages (gitter cells).,PMC6505806,PMC6505806_2
"A definitive clinical diagnosis of FIP is challenging and should rely on the history and clinical pathology data, such as complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, and effusion or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, in combination with direct or indirect viral detection.",PMC6505806,PMC6505806_3
"Effusion and CSF analysis often reveals high protein content and may provide further evidence for a clinical diagnosis of FIP. However, laboratory tests have been shown to be unreliable given the frequent false-negative results. PCR is a sensitive method that can be useful for diagnostic support in cases of FIP, especially in cats that have tested negative using other procedures. Genomic sequencing can discriminate between the viral strains and has offered encouraging results when compared to other tests. However, as shown by the results of this study and by other investigations, fat can be useful as a quick test during or immediately after autopsy, but IHC is a much more reliable test for diagnostic confirmation, especially in cases in which neurologic involvement was confirmed, given that the viral load in brain samples of cats affected by FIP has been",PMC6505806,PMC6505806_4
