"The trp-rich region of the S protein in SARS-CoV is essential for viral infectivity. Mutations in the aromatic amino acid residues of this region, such as global substitution, tri-, tetra-, and penta-substitution with alanine, completely abrogate infectivity, while single- and double-substitution with alanine decreases infectivity by >90%.",PMC2519895,PMC2519895_0
The aromatic residues in the trp-rich region play crucial roles during the viral entry process. Phe-substituted mutants in this region restore 10-25% infectivity compared to wild-type SARS-CoV.,PMC2519895,PMC2519895_1
"The trp-rich region functions as ""feet"" in the pre-fusion state to interact with the lipid-water interface and anchors the S protein on a lipid rafts-like environment on the viral surface. Mutations in this region change its hydrophobic moments and ability to anchor stably on the membrane to support the fusion process.",PMC2519895,PMC2519895_2
The trp-rich region has a similar motif as the consensus sequence found in a group of proteins that sequester to cholesterol-rich regions of membranes. This region may interact with lipid rafts in triggering the aggregation of lipid rafts and promoting membrane fusion.,PMC2519895,PMC2519895_3
Lipid rafts are involved in the viral entry process in SARS-CoV infection. The aromatic amino acid residues in the trp-rich region play crucial roles in viral infectivity and may interact with lipid rafts in triggering the aggregation of lipid rafts and promoting membrane fusion.,PMC2519895,PMC2519895_4
