"A study conducted in Saudi Arabia has provided molecular evidence of influenza A virus infection in dromedary camels imported from Sudan and Djibouti, but not in locally raised camels.",PMC6767964,PMC6767964_0
"The study detected viral RNA from both male and female camels of various ages, suggesting that dromedary camels could serve as a potential unknown host and zoonotic source for influenza A viruses.",PMC6767964,PMC6767964_1
"The study found that viral RNA was detected in both male and female camels of various ages, indicating that dromedary camels could potentially serve as a host for influenza A viruses.",PMC6767964,PMC6767964_2
"The study detected viral RNA from camels arriving from two different African countries, Sudan and Djibouti, at multiple time points over two years, which reduces the possibility of environmental contamination or simple respiratory exposure to infected humans or animals.",PMC6767964,PMC6767964_3
"The study suggests that dromedary camels could be a source of influenza A virus transmission to other livestock, highlighting the need for enhanced field surveillance for influenza A viruses as well as other pathogens in dromedary camels to implement better preventative one-health plans and programs.",PMC6767964,PMC6767964_4
