"Exposure to air pollutants, particularly fine particulate matter (pm2.5), is associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases and premature mortality, as demonstrated by both epidemiological and experimental studies.",PMC5473351,PMC5473351_0
"Nanoparticles (np) and ultrafine particles (ufps) have unique physicochemical properties, such as high surface reactivity and pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects, that may contribute to adverse health effects, including lung fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis.",PMC5473351,PMC5473351_1
"The toxicity of np and ufps is dependent on their physicochemical properties, such as size, shape, surface chemistry, and dispersibility, as well as the route and duration of exposure.",PMC5473351,PMC5473351_2
"The toxicological effects of np and ufps are more pronounced than those of their larger counterparts due to their high deposition rate in the alveolar region, impaired clearance by alveolar macrophages, and higher surface reactivity and pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects.",PMC5473351,PMC5473351_3
"Future research is needed to better understand the impact of nano-scale pollutants on human health, including the mechanisms of toxicity, the potential long-term effects, and strategies for prevention and mitigation.",PMC5473351,PMC5473351_4
