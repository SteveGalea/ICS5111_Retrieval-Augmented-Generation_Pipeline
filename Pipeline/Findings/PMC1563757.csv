"Experimental data shows that etm, flanked with two lysine residues, incorporated in model lipid bilayers adopts an Î±-helical conformation, with a transmembrane topology, i.e., c- and n-termini in opposite sides of the lipid bilayer.",PMC1563757,PMC1563757_0
This pentameric form could be responsible for the ion channel effects observed in vitro in the full length polypeptide of protein e.,PMC1563757,PMC1563757_1
"The pentameric form we report is unlikely to be an artifact, because these tm interactions and oligomeric size are consistent with evolutionary conservation data and expression of the complete sars-cov e polypeptide, and also consistent with the reported ion channel activity.",PMC1563757,PMC1563757_2
"The ion conductance of this putative channel, using the pore radius profile, is 74 ps, which is remarkably similar to that reported experimentally (80 ps) using a synthetic polypeptide of sars-cov e (9).",PMC1563757,PMC1563757_3
"The pentameric form of etm, with a transmembrane topology, is unlikely to be an artifact because it is consistent with evolutionary conservation data and expression of the complete sars-cov e polypeptide, and also consistent with the reported ion channel activity.",PMC1563757,PMC1563757_4
