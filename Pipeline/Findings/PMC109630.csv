"Tgev viral assemblies detected in infected swine testicular (ST) cells include characteristic budding profiles, large spherical viral particles with an electron-dense internal periphery and a clear center, and smaller viral particles with a homogeneously dense internal core.",PMC109630,PMC109630_0
"The small viral particles contain an annular, dense internal structure, and both large and small viral particles coexist in the golgi complex of infected cells.",PMC109630,PMC109630_1
"The large virions are more abundant in the perinuclear region, which is rich in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated elements.",PMC109630,PMC109630_2
"Treatment with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole arrests the transport of viral particles beyond the golgi complex, preventing the formation of large annular virions with a very electron-dense periphery and a less dense center.",PMC109630,PMC109630_3
"Treatment with the drug brefeldin A (BFA) disrupts the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi complex, leading to the formation of large cisternae with accumulation of large virions with an electron-dense periphery and a less dense center.",PMC109630,PMC109630_4
