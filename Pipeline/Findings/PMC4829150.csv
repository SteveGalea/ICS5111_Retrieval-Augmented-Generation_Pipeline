"This study demonstrates a novel equilibrium in the vascular wall of ace2-deficient mice through processes associated with increased aortic oxidative stress and decreased •NO bioavailability, leading to endothelial dysfunction.",PMC4829150,PMC4829150_0
"The study reveals a drastic reduction in •NO availability in ace2-deficient mice, which is caused by two different effects of ace2 depletion: a reduction in active eNOS and an inactivation of •NO by ROS.",PMC4829150,PMC4829150_1
"The study shows that endothelial dysfunction in ace2-deficient mice is associated with increased local and systemic tbARs levels, indicating increased lipid peroxidation.",PMC4829150,PMC4829150_2
"The study reveals that ace2-deficient mice show a significant decrease in ucp2 mRNA levels in aorta, which may directly contribute to the increase in ROS bioavailability and decreased •NO bioavailability, leading to endothelial dysfunction.",PMC4829150,PMC4829150_3
"The study provides insights into the role of ace2 in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis and the role of the RAS in both vascular and systemic redox balance, highlighting ace2/ANG-(1–7)/MAS axis as a potential target for the development of novel cardiovascular protective and/or antioxidant drugs.",PMC4829150,PMC4829150_4
