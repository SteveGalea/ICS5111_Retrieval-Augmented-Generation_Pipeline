The present study reveals that epac1 plays a critical role during ebov infection in endothelial cells by regulating viral uptake via modulation of the pi3k signaling pathway-mediated filoviral macropinocytosis.,PMC6213290,PMC6213290_0
"Inactivation of epac1 by esis significantly attenuates ebov infection in endothelial cells by abrogating the creation of ebov-induced macropinocytosis formed in the ruffling regions of the endothelial plasma membrane, suggesting that ebov gp-mediated virus uptake requires the involvement of the host camp-epac1 signaling pathway.",PMC6213290,PMC6213290_1
"Owing to the generally large size of filamentous particles, these viruses are predominantly taken up through macropinocytosis in which classic clathrin-, caveolin-, and phagocytosis-mediated endocytosis is not critically involved.",PMC6213290,PMC6213290_2
"Epac1 is known to regulate all of the aforementioned cellular functions, but the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which epac1 controls ebov uptake is not clear.",PMC6213290,PMC6213290_3
"The present study using an ex vivo model reveals a novel role for epac1 in ebov infection, namely epac1 governs ebov internalization via regulation of pi3k pathway-mediated filoviral macropinocytosis in vascular endothelial cells.",PMC6213290,PMC6213290_4
