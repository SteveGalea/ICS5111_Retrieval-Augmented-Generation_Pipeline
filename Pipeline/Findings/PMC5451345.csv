"The study showed that patients with hrv detected in the lower respiratory tract have similar outcomes to patients with lri due to known pathogenic viruses such as rsv, piv, and influenza virus, even after excluding other potential bacterial, fungal, and viral co-pathogens.",PMC5451345,PMC5451345_0
"Mortality in patients with hrv lri is similar to that for other well-established viral pneumonias, such as rsv, piv, hmpv, and influenza virus, even after adjusting for several important factors, such as the presence of co-pathogens and oxygen use at the time of diagnosis.",PMC5451345,PMC5451345_1
"The study documented a high viral load for hrv in lung tissue, as evidenced by the ability to culture hrv from lung biopsies in 6 of 22 patients who had cultures performed.",PMC5451345,PMC5451345_2
"The study provides further evidence that hrv is a serious pathogen in the lower respiratory tract of hct recipients, supported by similar outcomes of patients with hrv in the bal compared to those with well-established respiratory pathogens such as rsv and influenza virus and by the presence of hrv in lung tissue.",PMC5451345,PMC5451345_3
"The study documented mortality rates approaching 20% by 3 months after diagnosis in patients who likely had minimal or no acute lung injury at the time of diagnosis, indicating an important negative impact on survival, especially in patients with oxygen use at the time of diagnosis.",PMC5451345,PMC5451345_4
