"The study identified 18 out of 20 brown Norway (BN) rats from a natural outbreak of Helicobacter pullorum (HP) in mice as being infected with HP. This was confirmed by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, which also identified 10 out of 12 HP isolates from human patients with inflammatory bowel disease.",PMC3541769,PMC3541769_0
"In experimentally infected BN rats, HP was also confirmed as being persistently colonised for 30 weeks, and caused no clinical signs or gastrointestinal pathology.",PMC3541769,PMC3541769_1
"The study also found that HP was naturally colonising rats and mice, and was able to experimentally infect rats and mice.",PMC3541769,PMC3541769_2
"The study highlights the need for further studies on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of HP, as it poses a zoonotic risk to personnel exposed to HP-infected animals.",PMC3541769,PMC3541769_3
The study also suggests that HP should be included in the differential diagnosis when HP-specific PCR results are positive.,PMC3541769,PMC3541769_4
