The study found that hand washing during outdoor activities significantly reduces the incidence of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in basic military training facilities.,PMC6078659,PMC6078659_0
The study revealed that early implementation of hand washing during outdoor activities decreased the ARI rate by 15%.,PMC6078659,PMC6078659_1
"The study suggests that hand washing during outdoor activities should be emphasized as early as possible, especially in group living settings where endemic viral infections are expected.",PMC6078659,PMC6078659_2
"The study highlights the importance of hand washing during outdoor activities in preventing ARIs, as the probability of transmission of viruses is higher during training due to the close contact of trainees and sharing of training tools.",PMC6078659,PMC6078659_3
The study suggests that future studies are needed to demonstrate whether other methods such as alcohol-based hand cleansing during field training further decrease ARI incidence at military training facilities.,PMC6078659,PMC6078659_4
"The study found that early implementation of hand washing during outdoor activities decreased the ARI rate by 15% during the last 2 weeks of basic military training, and the overall cumulative incidence rate of ARI during the last 2 weeks after intervention was significantly lower in the early hand washing group compared to the late hand washing group.",PMC6078659,PMC6078659_5
"The study found that the overall cumulative incidence rate of ARI during the 4 weeks of basic military training was significantly lower in the early hand washing group compared to the late hand washing group, with effect sizes ranging from small to medium.",PMC6078659,PMC6078659_6
The study suggests that the implementation of early hand washing reduced the ARI rate by 13% during the 4 weeks of basic military training.,PMC6078659,PMC6078659_7
"The study found that the effect size of the difference in ARI incidence between the early hand washing group and the late hand washing group was from small to medium, taking a value of 0.38 during the 4 weeks of basic military training and from small to medium, taking a value of 0.35 during the last 2 weeks of basic military training after intervention.",PMC6078659,PMC6078659_8
"The study found that the overall cumulative incidence rate of ARI during the last 2 weeks after intervention was significantly lower in the early hand washing group compared to the late hand washing group, with effect sizes ranging from small to medium, taking a value of 0.35.",PMC6078659,PMC6078659_9
