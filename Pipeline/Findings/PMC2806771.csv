"The structure-activity relationship of small-molecule inhibitors targeting viral fusion proteins reveals that binding of high affinity compounds, such as tmc353121, involves the formation of a distorted 6-helix bundle, with the compound sandwiched between hr1 and hr2 at the end of the 6-helix distal to where the two fusing membranes are brought together. This binding mode disrupts the natural closing of the zipper process required for stable pore formation, which may prevent the formation of a fusion-competent conformation of the fusion protein and/or alter the timing of 6-helix bundle formation required for stable pore formation.",PMC2806771,PMC2806771_0
"The current model of paramyxoviral fusion predicts that the viral membrane is brought close to the host cell membrane by refolding of the fusion protein from a “prehairpin” to a “hairpin” conformation. In agreement with this model, the observed distorted 6-helix bundle in the presence of bound tmc353121 may disrupt the timing of 6-helix bundle formation required for stable pore formation.",PMC2806771,PMC2806771_1
"The binding mode of tmc353121 explains the selection of the d486n resistance mutation, as the sidechain of d486 forms a hydrogen bond with tmc353121 and an additional intramolecular hydrogen bond, d486n likely destabilizes the interaction with tmc353121, consistent with the reduction in susceptibility observed for the d486n mutant virus.",PMC2806771,PMC2806771_2
"Resistance mutations in fusion protein regions distinct from the binding site of fusion inhibitors have previously been described in rsv, measles virus, arenavirus, and influenza a viruses, as well as in other viruses, and alter the stability of the fusion protein to reestablish optimal viral fusion kinetics.",PMC2806771,PMC2806771_3
"The observed binding mode of tmc353121 does not explain the k394r and s398l mutations in the globular loop region. However, resistance mutations in fusion protein regions distinct from the binding site of fusion inhibitors have previously been described in rsv (24, 28), as well as in other viruses",PMC2806771,PMC2806771_4
