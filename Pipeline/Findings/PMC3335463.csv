"The human genome contains viral and bacterial double-stranded DNA, as well as human DNA, due to homology between viral and human proteins. This homology allows viruses to subvert human protein networks, promoting disease by either interfering with their human counterparts or by occupying and blocking them, resulting in increased levels of the corresponding ligands.",PMC3335463,PMC3335463_0
"The human genome also contains multiple homologous viral proteins to both viral and human proteomes. These homologous proteins can be targeted by autoantibodies, resulting in autoimmune-related attack of diverse compartments, including oligodendrocyte cell loss, impaired synaptic connectivity, and pyramidal cell dendrite shrinkage, as seen in schizophrenia.",PMC3335463,PMC3335463_1
"The human genome is also subject to phage or viral infection, as many viruses have been found to bind to human proteins with homology to their viral risk factors. Infection and genetics therefore appear to be interdependent, as the genes promote disease if the homologous pathogen is encountered, targeting many relevant proteins at once.",PMC3335463,PMC3335463_2
"Pathogens may promote disease if the human genes encode for proteins with homology to the viral risk factors, but on a massive scale, targeting many relevant proteins at once. Viral interference with these same proteins might be expected to promote the same effects in schizophrenia and other conditions, but on a massive scale, targeting many relevant proteins at once.",PMC3335463,PMC3335463_3
"Pathogen detection and elimination or vaccination, particularly prior to pregnancy, might reduce the incidence of schizophrenia and other conditions, as well as improve the armoury and safety of drugs against parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii and Borrelia, and related autoimmune diseases caused by pathogens but dependent on our genes. Autoimmunity, involving several key schizophrenia-related proteins, may well be a consequence of pathogen infection, and related to viral/human protein homology.",PMC3335463,PMC3335463_4
