"In a large cohort study of pediatric patients infected with common respiratory viruses, an immunocompromised state was associated with an increased risk of severe lower respiratory tract disease in multivariable models.",PMC6437838,PMC6437838_0
"Younger age, the presence of an underlying pulmonary disorder, and the detection of a respiratory copathogen were also associated with lower respiratory tract disease or severe lower respiratory tract disease.",PMC6437838,PMC6437838_1
"The study found striking seasonality of the four common strains of respiratory viruses, with higher rates of detection for all four strains in winter but much lower rates in other seasons of every year.",PMC6437838,PMC6437838_2
"In a subset analysis of immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised children admitted for febrile illness regardless of localizing signs, respiratory viruses, including human coronavirus (hCoV), were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) frequently in febrile children without localizing signs.",PMC6437838,PMC6437838_3
"The study found that compared to hCoV alone, the odds of lower respiratory tract disease or severe lower respiratory tract disease were much higher in children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) coinfection than in those with coinfection with a non-RSV copathogen.",PMC6437838,PMC6437838_4
