"The study found that control measures had a substantial psychological effect on contacts and members of their household, with stress-related complaints persisting for a longer period. The interference scale score was found to be the main predictor of perceived stress, suggesting that the disturbance experienced in daily life determines the magnitude of the psychological effect.",PMC3376788,PMC3376788_0
"The study revealed that compliance with temperature monitoring and prohibitions on leaving the country was difficult to include in daily life, with some respondents having already paid for a holiday trip and subsequently having to cancel it. Increased costs that persons incurred imply that compensation policies (e.g., insurance) should be explained or made available in preparedness plans.",PMC3376788,PMC3376788_1
"The study showed that control measures had a measurable psychological effect and personal consequences (such as restrictions on social life) on respondents in both risk contact groups. Some respondents had already paid for a holiday trip and subsequently had to cancel it, and increased costs that persons incurred imply that compensation policies (e.g., insurance) should be explained or made available in preparedness plans.",PMC3376788,PMC3376788_2
"The study found that practical constraints related to temperature monitoring should be addressed to facilitate communication with health care providers and that once a day monitoring is usually followed by twice a day monitoring, although twice a day monitoring is not an evidence-based recommendation.",PMC3376788,PMC3376788_3
"The study demonstrated that control measures had a substantial psychological effect on contacts and members of their household, with stress-related complaints persisting for a longer period. The study also showed that the disturbance experienced in daily life determines the magnitude of the psychological effect, as indicated by the interference scale score being the main predictor of perceived stress. The study reinforced the hypothesis that psychological symptoms may persist longer.",PMC3376788,PMC3376788_4
