"TGEV induces apoptotic cell death in porcine cells through internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, nuclear DNA content decrease, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, and activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer cell factor (NF-κB), leading to nuclear DNA degradation and cell membrane integrity disruption.",PMC110052,PMC110052_0
"The apoptotic effect of TGEV is mediated by the activation of caspases, as evidenced by the inhibitory effects of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk and the apoptotic inhibitory peptide pyrrolidone (PDT).",PMC110052,PMC110052_1
"TGEV-induced apoptosis is associated with a breakdown of mitochondrial function, as shown by the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential.",PMC110052,PMC110052_2
"The activation of NF-κB in TGEV-infected cells is secondary to apoptosis, as revealed by the inhibitory effects of NF-κB decoy oligonucleotides.",PMC110052,PMC110052_3
"The antioxidant PDTC has a protective effect against TGEV-induced apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of oxidative stress in the cell death process.",PMC110052,PMC110052_4
