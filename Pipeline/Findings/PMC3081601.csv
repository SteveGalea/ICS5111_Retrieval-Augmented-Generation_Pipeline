"The solution structure of nsp7 at pH 6.5 reveals a conserved core of helices α2 and α3, with helices α1 and α4 adopting different conformations. The crystal structure at pH 7.5 shows a flat three-helix sheet with helices α2, α3, and α4 packed against each other.",PMC3081601,PMC3081601_0
"The nsp7 structure at pH 6.5 shows a reduced population of helix α4, which is not compatible with the binding mode observed in the crystal structure. This suggests that locking of helix α4 in a conformation that prevents binding to nsp8 could impair the replication machinery of the virus.",PMC3081601,PMC3081601_1
"The study confirms indications from earlier work that helices α2 and α3 form a conserved core of the nsp7 structure, with helices α1 and α4 adopting different conformations. This implies that the nsp7 fold could be interpreted as a scaffold consisting of a three-helix bundle, with a fourth helix in equilibrium with transiently unfolded forms affecting the species specificity of physiological activity.",PMC3081601,PMC3081601_2

This implies that the nsp7 fold could be interpreted as a scaffold consisting of a three-helix bundle, with a fourth helix in equilibrium with transiently unfolded forms affecting the species specificity of physiological activity. This finding is in line with the fact that the sequence in helices α1–α3 is highly conserved among all CoVs, while the sequence of helix α4 is quite variable, indicating that the nsp7 fold could be interpreted as a scaffold consisting of a three-helix bundle, with a fourth helix in equilibrium",PMC3081601,PMC3081601_4
