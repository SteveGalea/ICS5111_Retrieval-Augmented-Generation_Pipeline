"In Argentina, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (iiv3) was introduced into the national immunization program (NIP) in 2011 for children 6 months to 2 years old and other target groups, and vaccine coverage in young children (6 months to 2 years old) ranged between 72% (for the first dose) and 50% (for the second dose) from 2011 to 2015. A case-control study carried out at three pediatric hospitals in Argentina showed that iiv3 effectiveness was 73% in children 6 months to 2 years old.",PMC6645205,PMC6645205_0
"In Brazil, influenza immunization is routinely administered to children 6 months to 5 years old, adults 60 years old and older, pregnant or postpartum women, health care workers, the indigenous population, individuals in prison, and high-risk groups, and vaccine coverage exceeded 80% in all groups from 2011 to 2014. In 2015, approximately 50 million people (25% of the population) were immunized.",PMC6645205,PMC6645205_1
"In Argentina, a study carried out using the influenza A/H1N1 mF59-adjuvanted vaccine in 2013 showed that vaccinated pregnant women had a lower risk of giving birth to low-weight babies (odds ratio: 0.74) and premature deliveries (odds ratio: 0.79).",PMC6645205,PMC6645205_2
"In Brazil, in 2015, the majority of vaccines used during the influenza season were manufactured locally by Instituto Butantan (SÃ£o Paulo).",PMC6645205,PMC6645205_3
"Challenges in influenza prevention in Argentina and Brazil include parent misinformation, decreasing immunization rates, and safety concerns for the use of repetitive doses of adjuvanted vaccines in young children. Strategies and actions to improve protection include developing an influenza monitoring system, estimating case-fatality rates, increasing vaccine coverage, promoting vaccination at childcare centers, carrying out long-term vaccine safety surveillance, considering the introduction of adjuvanted vaccines, and considering universal vaccination of schoolchildren in Brazil. Education and communication actions include enhancing education of health professionals, reinforcing the nurse's role",PMC6645205,PMC6645205_4
