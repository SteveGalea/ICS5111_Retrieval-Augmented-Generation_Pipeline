"This study found that hantavirus RNA can be detected in the saliva of patients with nephropathia epidemica (NPE), indicating that hantavirus RNA may be transmitted through saliva during coughing or kissing.",PMC2570843,PMC2570843_0
"The study found that hantavirus RNA was present in the saliva of most (14 out of 14) hospitalized NPE patients, suggesting that hantavirus RNA in saliva could have a high infectious potential.",PMC2570843,PMC2570843_1
"The study found that hantavirus RNA was detectable in saliva up to 9 days after onset of symptoms, indicating that hantavirus RNA in saliva could persist for several days.",PMC2570843,PMC2570843_2
"The study found that hantavirus RNA in saliva was most closely related to hantavirus strains found in northern Sweden, where NPE is endemic, supporting the hypothesis that person-to-person transmission of hantavirus may occur through inhalation of rodent excreta.",PMC2570843,PMC2570843_3
"The study found that hantavirus RNA in saliva was present in patients with respiratory symptoms, indicating that hantavirus may be transmitted through respiratory secretions such as coughing and kissing.",PMC2570843,PMC2570843_4
