"A bat found in Germany in 2009 with rabies-like symptoms was identified as a natterer's bat, and a new lyssavirus, named Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV), was discovered.",PMC3381583,PMC3381583_0
"BBLV is antigenically atypical and differs from other lyssavirus species, as indicated by a distinctive pattern in the reaction with a panel of antinucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies.",PMC3381583,PMC3381583_1
"Phylogenetic analysis showed that BBLV is most closely related to KHUV, followed by European bat lyssavirus (EBLV)-2, and is pathogenic, causing a fatal disease in the natterer's bat with symptoms similar to rabies.",PMC3381583,PMC3381583_2
"Viral antigen was present in many locations of the brain, but surprisingly not in the salivary glands, and the exact date of infection is unknown, with an estimated incubation period greater than 4 months.",PMC3381583,PMC3381583_3
"Whether BBLV is the natural reservoir species or whether it was a cross-species spillover remains a subject for further studies, but closely related lyssavirus species have been isolated from Myotis spp. Bats, indicating their key role in lyssavirus epidemiology.",PMC3381583,PMC3381583_4
