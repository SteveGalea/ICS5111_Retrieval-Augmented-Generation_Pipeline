This study demonstrates that cpbvdv-induced cytoplasmic vacuolization is an early response to viral infection that is distinct from apoptosis and necrosis.,PMC2289992,PMC2289992_0
"The autophagy-like cellular response to cpbvdv is different from apoptosis, necrosis, and recently described necroapoptosis.",PMC2289992,PMC2289992_1
"Virus-induced vacuoles possess phagocytic properties, responsible for digestion of cytoplasm and cytoplasmic components, suggesting that this form of vacuole-mediated autolysis could be named phagoptosis.",PMC2289992,PMC2289992_2
"Three classes of autophagy have been described: macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and microautophagy. Bvdv-induced cytoplasmic vacuolization is inconsistent with macroautophagy.",PMC2289992,PMC2289992_3
The absence of three out of four parameters for determination of macroautophagy suggests that bvdv-induced vacuolization is different from macroautophagy.,PMC2289992,PMC2289992_4
