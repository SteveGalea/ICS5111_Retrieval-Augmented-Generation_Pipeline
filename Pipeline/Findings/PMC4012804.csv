"The study developed an SNP real-time RT-PCR for detecting a drug-resistant NA r292k mutant of influenza A(H7N9) virus, with a sensitivity threshold of 10% for a minor component in a mixed viral population.",PMC4012804,PMC4012804_0
The assay had a linear range of sensitivity from 102 to 108 copies/reaction and could detect the mutant in a mixture at a proportion of 2% of 104 copies/reaction.,PMC4012804,PMC4012804_1
The assay was specific for detecting the mutant NA gene of influenza A(H7N9) virus and did not cross-amplify with other respiratory viruses.,PMC4012804,PMC4012804_2
"The study validated the assay with clinical samples and found that seven of eleven samples had positive results, with correct estimation of mutant proportion ranging from 10% to 98%.",PMC4012804,PMC4012804_3
"The study suggested that influenza A(H7N9) virus mutated under the pressure of antiviral treatment, leading to failure of the virus to clear lower respiratory tracts, but host immune response played a major role in controlling the mutant virus, as evidenced by the recovery of two patients infected with the drug-resistant mutant virus.",PMC4012804,PMC4012804_4
