"Pi4k enzymes and their product lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), play a crucial role in the replication of multiple different RNA viruses, including picornaviruses, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and dengue virus.",PMC3389303,PMC3389303_0
"PtdIns4P lipids are required for viral RNA synthesis and serve as a panviral target for antiviral therapy, as they are produced by viruses during replication and are essential for their propagation.",PMC3389303,PMC3389303_1
"Viruses hijack the host cell's PtdIns4P lipid biosynthetic machinery by interacting with and recruiting host proteins, such as the acetyl-CoA carboxylase 3 (ACC3) protein, which is involved in viral replication and is recruited by viruses through their 3A proteins.",PMC3389303,PMC3389303_2
"Inhibition of PtdIns4P lipid production or disruption of the interaction between viral proteins and PtdIns4P lipids can effectively inhibit viral replication, as shown in studies using picornaviruses and hepatitis C virus.",PMC3389303,PMC3389303_3
"Understanding the roles of PtdIns4P lipids in viral replication may also shed light on their functions in eukaryotic and prokaryotic RNA metabolism, as these lipids are involved in the regulation of viral RNA synthesis and may contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis in host cells.",PMC3389303,PMC3389303_4
