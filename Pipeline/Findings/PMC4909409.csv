"Hippuristanol, a polyhydroxylated steroid, selectively inhibits eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) by locking it in an aberrant closed conformation, preventing its transition from a closed to an open state, which is essential for its helicase activity.",PMC4909409,PMC4909409_0
"Hippuristanol is a more potent inhibitor of eIF4A than pateamine A and rocaglates, which stimulate eIF4A:RNA binding, and differs from them in the mechanism of action.",PMC4909409,PMC4909409_1
"Hippuristanol inhibits the atpase activity of both eIF4AI and eIF4AIi, with eIF4AIi, which has a higher degeneracy within the hippuristanol-binding site, requiring 10 times more hippuristanol for inhibition.",PMC4909409,PMC4909409_2
"Hippuristanol exhibits anti-neoplastic activity, and has been shown to block eIF4A/eIF4F function in tumor cells, delaying tumor onset and progression in a chemically-induced skin tumor model.",PMC4909409,PMC4909409_3
Increased eIF4E levels and eIF4F activity have been linked to resistance to pi3k/mtor targeted therapies in cancer.,PMC4909409,PMC4909409_4
