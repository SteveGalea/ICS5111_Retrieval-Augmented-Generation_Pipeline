"Mers-cov entry and replication are mediated by the viral structural protein E and accessory proteins 3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b. These proteins are difficult to study due to their low expression level and low molecular weight, but they have been identified as essential targets for anti-viral therapeutics. 2. The chloropyridine ester ce-5, previously identified as an inhibitor of sars-cov, also inhibits mers-cov 3clpro, which is involved in the inhibition of ifn production and works as a strong inhibitor of type 1 ifn by inhibiting dsrna recognition by cellular rig-i-like helicases. 3. The rna-binding domain of 4a, which binds dsrna and does not allow it to bind to the rna-binding domain of rig-i-like helicases, thereby inhibiting the anti-viral signaling pathway, is a key residue involved in the binding of rna to the rna-binding domain in 4a. 4. Mycophenolic acid, cyclosporin a, ifnα, and ifnβ effectively inhibit mers-cov replication, and ribavirin has previously been used against sars-cov with increased efficiency when cotreated with ifnα2b. 5. The mers-cov e protein, which is involved in viral assembly, budding, and intracellular trafficking, can also be targeted for anti-viral activity. These findings have been confirmed through in vitro studies and the availability of drug-testing techniques has sped up the identification of new drugs and the confirmation of their anti-viral efficacy.",PMC4558490,PMC4558490_0
