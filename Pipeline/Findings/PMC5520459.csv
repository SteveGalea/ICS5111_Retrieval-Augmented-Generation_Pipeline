"The paper highlights the existence of a new class of virus-cell interactions, where viruses 'hijack' host cell death machinery, such as caspases, for their own benefit. This strategy offers new avenues to explore towards understanding and controlling viral pathogenesis.",PMC5520459,PMC5520459_0
"The paper presents examples of viruses that 'hijack' non-apoptotic forms of cell death, such as necroptosis, to facilitate their own replication. These strategies could offer new insights into viral pathogenesis.",PMC5520459,PMC5520459_1
The paper presents a systematic survey of predicted caspase-3 cleavage sites in endemic human pathogenic viruses. This survey could include some true positive cleavage events among the false positives.,PMC5520459,PMC5520459_2
"The paper presents a screen for novel caspase cleavage events based on simple criteria, such as a reduction or defect of intracellular viral replication under caspase inhibition and the existence of one or more viral proteins that undergo caspase-dependent cleavage.",PMC5520459,PMC5520459_3
"The paper presents examples of viral proteins that undergo caspase-dependent cleavage, such as the nucleocapsid protein of crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus, which is cleaved by caspase-3 activity. This finding could offer new insights into viral pathogenesis.",PMC5520459,PMC5520459_4
