A systematic review of medical reports published between 1985 and 2018 has identified a strong association between respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and adverse outcomes in lung transplant recipients (LTRs). RSV was found to be the most commonly linked virus to these outcomes.,PMC6930876,PMC6930876_0
The review also found that influenza A viruses and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) are major causes of morbidity and mortality among LTRs.,PMC6930876,PMC6930876_1
"RSV infection was noted to occur most frequently during the winter months, when RSV is most prevalent. PIVs, on the other hand, were reported as causing adverse outcomes throughout the year.",PMC6930876,PMC6930876_2
"The study suggests that intensive, year-round surveillance for respiratory viruses among LTRs is warranted due to the severity and frequency of these adverse outcomes.",PMC6930876,PMC6930876_3
"The authors argue that these observations support the need for continued evaluation of the relationship between respiratory virus infection and adverse LTR outcomes, as well as intensive, year-round surveillance for respiratory viruses among LTRs.",PMC6930876,PMC6930876_4
