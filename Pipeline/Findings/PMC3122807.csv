The authors developed a sensitive assay utilizing pyrosequencing technology for the detection of individual and mixed variants at position 222 in ha of the ph1n1 2009 influenza virus.,PMC3122807,PMC3122807_0
"The authors showed that the new approach, using a customized nucleotide dispensation order, is more informative than the traditional Sanger sequencing method and the pyrosequencing with the cyclic nucleotide dispensation order.",PMC3122807,PMC3122807_1
The authors demonstrated that the customized dispensation order approach allows the circumvention of the time-consuming and costly cloning of RT-PCR products from specimens containing virus variants.,PMC3122807,PMC3122807_2
The authors showed that the new approach can be useful in identifying the presence of multiple variants within influenza viruses and other pathogens.,PMC3122807,PMC3122807_3
The authors demonstrated that the quantitative nature of pyrosequencing allowed the calculation of virus variant proportions with the use of the peak heights within a pyrogram generated using the customized dispensation order.,PMC3122807,PMC3122807_4
