"The study found that neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) of mice infected with the neurotropic MHV virus survive the initial viral infection and continue to function, as evidenced by the expression of subgenomic mRNA and the preservation of OB structure and function.",PMC5660484,PMC5660484_0
"The study also found that a subgroup of neurons, including inhibitory neurons, continue to survive and function in the OB after infection with the highly pathogenic MHV virus, which causes clinical disease and death in mice.",PMC5660484,PMC5660484_1
"The study utilized a cre-recombinase system to label and track cells surviving mHV infection, allowing for the study of the cytokinetic and cytogenetic effects of the virus on cells in the OB.",PMC5660484,PMC5660484_2
"The study found that mice infected with the MHV virus have a high mortality rate, with 80% mortality by day 12 post-infection, but some surviving mice exhibit demyelinating disease.",PMC5660484,PMC5660484_3
"The study also found that mice infected with the MHV virus exhibit demyelination in the OB, as evidenced by the expression of the myelin basic protein (MBP), which is a marker for myelin.",PMC5660484,PMC5660484_4
