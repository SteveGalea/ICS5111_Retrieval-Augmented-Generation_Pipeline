"A study by Neumann et al. (2009) identified key amino acids in the influenza A virus nucleoprotein that contribute to oligomerization and RNA binding, shedding light on the mechanism by which the nucleoprotein forms oligomers and binds RNA.",PMC6505565,PMC6505565_0
"A comparison of the genomes of human and avian influenza A viruses by Chen et al. (2006) revealed genomic signatures that distinguish human and avian strains, providing insights into their evolutionary origins.",PMC6505565,PMC6505565_1
"A study by Finkelstein et al. (2006) elucidated the mechanism by which the influenza A virus nucleoprotein forms oligomers and binds RNA, which has implications for RNA binding, oligomerization, and vaccine design.",PMC6505565,PMC6505565_2
"A study by Huang et al. (2004) reported the generation of synthetic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus pseudoparticles, which has implications for assembly and vaccine production.",PMC6505565,PMC6505565_3
"A study by Tamura et al. (2011) presented molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods, shedding light on the evolutionary history of influenza viruses.",PMC6505565,PMC6505565_4
