"In Vancouver, patient 0 with SARS had a travel history to Hong Kong and was hospitalized with full respiratory precautions within 15 minutes of arrival. His wife, also with SARS, was recovering from mild illness, and no further follow-up was arranged. Contact tracing revealed no further spread.",PMC3291383,PMC3291383_0
"Patient 2, also with SARS, was asymptomatic but had prolonged contact with family members in Hong Kong. Upon return, she remained self-isolated with no contacts, but chest radiograph showed bilateral consolidation. She was admitted to an NPIR and transferred to the ICU. Neither of her household contacts had detectable SARS-CoV antibodies at day 215.",PMC3291383,PMC3291383_1
"Patient 3, also with SARS, cared for patient 2 at the hospital and assisted her in using the toilet. She followed guidelines in place at the time but did not wear eye protection. She remained self-isolated with no contacts but developed symptoms on April 4. She went to the hospital, and initial chest radiograph was normal, but computed tomography scan showed widespread, patchy, ground-glass opacification of both lungs. She was admitted to an NPIR. Her son, who drove her to the hospital masked, had no detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV at day 200.",PMC3291383,PMC3291383_2
