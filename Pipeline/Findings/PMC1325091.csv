The study demonstrated that both the hepa-filtration system and the low-cost-filtration system significantly reduced the spread of PRRSV by aerosols when compared with the use of UVC irradiation and the control condition.,PMC1325091,PMC1325091_0
"The performance of the hepa-filtration system was significantly better than that of the low-cost-filtration system, potentially due to the relatively small particle size of the artificial aerosols (0.3 to 3.0 Î¼m).",PMC1325091,PMC1325091_1
"UVC irradiation provided no reduction of aerosol transmission of PRRSV, potentially due to insufficient contact time despite a relatively low air velocity (1.5 m/s).",PMC1325091,PMC1325091_2
"Biosecurity protocols, such as proper transport-vehicle sanitation and the use of on-farm insect-control measures, in combination with hepa filtration of air, may provide farms with a high level of biosecurity against PRRSV.",PMC1325091,PMC1325091_3
"The study had much strength, including sufficient power for statistical analysis and the use of controls, but acknowledged limitations, such as the lack of detection of PRRSV in air samples and the need for lower challenge doses of PRRSV to clarify whether alternative methods have value.",PMC1325091,PMC1325091_4
