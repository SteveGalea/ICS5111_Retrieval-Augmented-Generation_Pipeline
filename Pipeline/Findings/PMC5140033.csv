"Rhinovirus (RV) is commonly detected in hospitalized patients, with 75% of the study population infected with RV, RV-A, or other respiratory viruses (non-RV). (Table SIII)",PMC5140033,PMC5140033_0
"The distribution of illness severity variables is significantly different between RV, RV-A, RV-C, and non-RV infections in hospitalized patients. (Table SV)",PMC5140033,PMC5140033_1
RV-A and RV-C infections are associated with differences in illness severity variables in hospitalized patients with atopy compared to those without atopy. (Table SVI),PMC5140033,PMC5140033_2
"Phylogenetic analysis based on sequences of the partial VP4/VP2 region of RV types using specific primers reveals distinct clustering of RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C reference types. (Figures S2-S4)",PMC5140033,PMC5140033_3
"Additional supporting information, including primers used for RV PCR and sequencing, as well as patient characteristics, can be found in the online version of the article. (Table SI)",PMC5140033,PMC5140033_4
