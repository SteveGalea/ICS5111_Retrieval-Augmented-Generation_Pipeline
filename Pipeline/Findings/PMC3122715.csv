"A study found that using skim milk-tryptone-glucose-glycerol (STGG) bacterial transport and storage medium for collecting nasopharyngeal swab specimens can preserve respiratory viruses, including adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with sensitivities of 96% and 100%, respectively, compared to using viral transport medium (VTM) for nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs).",PMC3122715,PMC3122715_0
"However, for influenza virus, particularly influenza B virus, detection from the STGG medium was disappointing, with an overall sensitivity of 77%. This could be due to the deleterious effect of a freeze-thaw cycle for bacterial culture or low viral load in some cases.",PMC3122715,PMC3122715_1
"The study found that all low positive results were repeated, and all influenza A virus-positive specimens were confirmed by a second PCR to determine the hemagglutinin type.",PMC3122715,PMC3122715_2
"The study suggests that STGG medium may be reliably used for viral nucleic acid detection, particularly for adenoviruses, influenza A virus, and RSV. Further work is required to optimize detection of influenza B virus RNA and to confirm the reproducibility of these findings in a larger panel of respiratory viruses.",PMC3122715,PMC3122715_3
