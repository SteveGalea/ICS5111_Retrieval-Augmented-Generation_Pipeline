"In this study, overexpression of occludin in vero e6 and ipec-j2 cells was achieved by introducing small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes to knock down endogenous occludin expression, followed by infection with pedv. This approach allowed for specific gene silencing and analysis of virus infection.",PMC5411586,PMC5411586_0
"Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to visualize pedv infection in vero e6 and ipec-j2 cells. Mouse anti-pedv spike protein mAb was used to stain cells, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch).",PMC5411586,PMC5411586_1
"In this study, western blot analysis was performed to analyze pedv infection and protein expression in vero e6 and ipec-j2 cells. The rabbit anti-occludin polyclonal antibody, rabbit anti-claudin-1 mAb, and mouse anti-β-actin mAb were used to stain cells, followed by incubation with an IRDye-conjugated secondary antibody (LI-COR).",PMC5411586,PMC5411586_2
"In this study, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was also used to visualize pedv infection and protein expression in vero e6 and ipec-j2 cells. Mouse anti-pedv spike protein mAb was used to stain cells, followed by incubation with FITC/TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch).",PMC5411586,PMC5411586_3
"In this study, the macropinocytosis inhibitors, 5-(n-ethyl-n-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) and rottlerin, were used to ablate endogenous occludin protein expression in vero e6 and ipec-j2 cells, followed by infection with pedv. These inhibitors were used at 50 μM and 10 μM, respectively, and their effects on virus infection were assessed.",PMC5411586,PMC5411586_4
