"Increased atp generation is required for efficient vaccinia virus (vv) production, and this is achieved through up-regulation of genes involved in atp production.",PMC2741444,PMC2741444_0
"Up-regulation of genes involved in atp production occurs after viral dna replication, as treatment with apigenin and ara c reduces the up-regulation of nd4 expression and the increase in atp generation.",PMC2741444,PMC2741444_1
"Increased atp generation is a bcl-2 independent event, as the amount of bcl-2 protein in the host cell does not increase after vv infection.",PMC2741444,PMC2741444_2
"Vv n1l protein, which has similar secondary structure as bcl-2 protein, does not influence atp levels in vivo, as neither nd4 nor coii gene was up-regulated by n1l protein.",PMC2741444,PMC2741444_3
"Up-regulation of genes involved in atp production occurs after viral dna replication, as these findings are consistent with the observation that neither nd4 nor coii gene was up-regulated by n1l protein, which is an early gene product.",PMC2741444,PMC2741444_4
