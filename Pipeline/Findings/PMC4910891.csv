"The study found that experimental respiratory viral infection can result in increases in carriage density of common bacteria or increases in acquisition, raising the possibility that bacteria exploit the ubiquitous respiratory viral infections of early childhood to promote colonization and transmission while minimizing serious pathology in their hosts.",PMC4910891,PMC4910891_0
The study confirmed an association between carriage of Haemophilus influenzae and rhinitis in healthy children and found a potential increase in bacterial acquisition induced by the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.,PMC4910891,PMC4910891_1
"The study found that colonization at the time of vaccination was associated with greater overall rises in density, suggesting that increases in bacterial load were due not to acquisition of new strains but to proliferation of those already present.",PMC4910891,PMC4910891_2
The study detected and quantified species-specific bacterial DNA using PCR rather than viable bacteria by conventional culture techniques and found that individuals with discordant PCR and culture results tend to have low density colonization.,PMC4910891,PMC4910891_3
"The study found that changes in nasal bacterial colonization density were evident around 28 days after immunization, raising questions about the time course of this effect in children.",PMC4910891,PMC4910891_4
