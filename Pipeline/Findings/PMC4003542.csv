"Blm administration in rats resulted in significant inflammation, exacerbated fibrosis, and severe alveolar destruction in rat lungs, as well as a dramatic increase in tgf-β1 expression, indicating the development of pf.",PMC4003542,PMC4003542_0
"Tanshinone IA (tiia) treatment significantly prevented the decrease in ace-2 and ang-(1-7) expression, as well as the accumulation of interstitial lung collagen, alleviating blm-induced pf in rat lungs.",PMC4003542,PMC4003542_1
"Tanshinone IA treatment notably halted the progression of fibrosis and collagen deposition in rat lungs after blm exposure, reversed the reduction of ace-2 and ang-(1-7) expression, and decreased the elevated tgf-β1 levels in rat lungs after blm administration.",PMC4003542,PMC4003542_2
The present study further explored the protective effects and mechanisms of tanshinone IA on pf models of rat and may offer basic information for clinical treating strategies on pf.,PMC4003542,PMC4003542_3
"The study revealed that tiia may exert protective effects on blm-induced pf in rat lungs, and the ace-2/ang-(1-7) axis may answer for those protective effects.",PMC4003542,PMC4003542_4
