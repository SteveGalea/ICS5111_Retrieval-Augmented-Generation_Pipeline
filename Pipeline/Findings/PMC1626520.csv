"In a study of households affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada, the secondary attack rate was 10.2%, with a linear association between the number of days the index case remained at home and the secondary attack rate. Households where the index case worked in healthcare had a significantly lower secondary attack rate than other households. Poor hand hygiene practices and poor use of respiratory protective measures were associated with increased risk of transmission, while engagement in household pastimes and time spent in close contact with the index case were both factors that were protective against SARS infection.",PMC1626520,PMC1626520_0
"A study of households affected by SARS in Singapore found a secondary attack rate of 12.3%. The study also found a linear association between the number of days the index case remained at home and the secondary attack rate, as well as lower secondary attack rates in households where the index case worked in healthcare.",PMC1626520,PMC1626520_1
"A study of households affected by SARS in Hong Kong found a secondary attack rate of 14.9%. The study also found lower secondary attack rates in households where the index case worked in healthcare, as well as a linear association between the number of days the index case remained at home and the secondary attack rate.",PMC1626520,PMC1626520_2
"Poor hand hygiene practices were associated with increased risk of transmission in the Canadian study, as well as in the other studies from Singapore and Hong Kong.",PMC1626520,PMC1626520_3
"In the Canadian study, the number of masks worn by household members was a risk factor for SARS transmission, and use of additional masks each day was associated with a 17% increase in the risk of secondary cases. In the adjusted model, engagement in household pastimes and time spent in close contact with the index case were both factors that were protective against SARS infection.",PMC1626520,PMC1626520_4
