"The study revealed that host factors, such as a very low level of immunity, are determinants of disease outcome rather than virus type in chronic rhinovirus infections in immunocompromised hosts.",PMC3119694,PMC3119694_0
The study found that chronic rhinovirus infections in immunocompromised hosts presented a similar propensity to infect the lower respiratory tract as in immunocompetent hosts infected with the same virus type.,PMC3119694,PMC3119694_1
"The study identified specific changes in the 5â€²utr polypyrimidine tract and two non-synonymous changes, one in the vp2 immunogenic site 2 and the second in protein 2a, after several months of infection in the lower respiratory tract populations.",PMC3119694,PMC3119694_2
"The study suggested that immunocompromised patients cannot clear viral infections as immunocompetent individuals, and represent a potential reservoir for the emergence of new variants and inter-host transmission due to longer chronic viral infection.",PMC3119694,PMC3119694_3
"The study highlighted the emergence of new therapies and progress in transplantation as constantly increasing the population of immunocompromised patients, which could accelerate the ability of viruses to adapt to the host, evolve, and propagate and may favor a more rapid emergence of new viral variants.",PMC3119694,PMC3119694_4
