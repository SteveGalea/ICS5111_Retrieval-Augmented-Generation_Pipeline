"In the context of sars-cov, traditional public health interventions, such as case finding and isolation, quarantine of close contacts, and enhanced infection control measures in healthcare settings, were effective in containing the spread of the virus. These measures also contained a smaller sars outbreak in 2004 that originated from a laboratory-acquired infection.",PMC3329045,PMC3329045_0
"Limited information exists on the relative effectiveness of methods of providing information on sars (or other illnesses) to travelers. For inbound travelers who may have been exposed to sars, such information should include what to do if symptoms develop and the need to inform healthcare workers who provide care for them in advance to take appropriate precautions.",PMC3329045,PMC3329045_1
"In the context of sars, contact tracing was facilitated by its relatively long serial interval and incubation period. Most infections did not lead to further transmission, although a small number of ""super-spreading"" events occurred in which single unrecognized cases transmitted to many people, usually in hospitals or households, before appropriate infection control precautions were in place.",PMC3329045,PMC3329045_2
"In the context of sars, transmission occurred primarily in healthcare or household settings, with close person-to-person contact. Cases among children were uncommon, and children did not seem to be involved in transmission.",PMC3329045,PMC3329045_3
"For countries lacking specific countermeasures, such as drugs and vaccines, nonmedical public health interventions may be the only measures available to combat epidemics. Decisions regarding implementation should be based on expert scientific advice from WHO and national authorities; the epidemiologic features of the disease and available resources should be taken into account.",PMC3329045,PMC3329045_4
