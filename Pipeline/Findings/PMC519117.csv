"In bacterial genomes, frameshift signals play a crucial role in the translation of mRNA into proteins, as they allow for the decoding of stop codons and the synthesis of proteins with N-terminal methionines. The presence or absence of frameshift signals can also affect the expression level and regulation of genes.",PMC519117,PMC519117_0
"The program fsfinder, developed by the authors, is capable of predicting both -1 and +1 frameshift signals in long DNA or mRNA sequences with increased sensitivity and specificity compared to existing computational models. This is achieved by considering most of known potentially relevant components and by searching both + and - strands, prioritizing candidate signals in the overlapping regions of open reading frames.",PMC519117,PMC519117_1
"In Borrelia burgdorferi, a well-known example of frameshift signals, fsfinder predicted a cuuugac heptameric sequence in the overlapping region of the orfs in the +1 strand of the genome, which corresponds to a known +1 frameshift site in prfb. It also predicted a new -1 frameshift site in the overlap region.",PMC519117,PMC519117_2
"In Escherichia coli, a well-known example of frameshift signals, fsfinder missed 11 frameshift sites in 38 bacterial genomes with rf2 genes from GenBank since their slippery sequences were of the form cuu ura c. However, on average, fsfinder detected no -1 frameshift sites and 0.9 +1 frameshift sites in the overlapping regions of open reading frames.",PMC519117,PMC519117_3
"Biochemical experiments are currently underway to confirm the predictions made by fsfinder in Borrelia burgdorferi. This highlights the importance of fully understanding the underlying mechanisms and discovering new genes associated with frameshift signals. However, frameshift signals are diverse and organism-dependent, so fsfinder will be extended in the future to find any frameshift site modeled by the user.",PMC519117,PMC519117_4
