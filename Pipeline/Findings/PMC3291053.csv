"In the context of global health governance, the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 represents a seminal development for global health surveillance. The IHR 2005 prescribes essential elements of a surveillance system and seeks to achieve critical attributes of usefulness, sensitivity, timeliness, and stability.",PMC3291053,PMC3291053_0
"In the context of emerging infectious diseases, the sensitivity of surveillance systems for new pathogens has historically been limited, particularly if such pathogens presented themselves in unusual or unexpected ways. Recent modeling has shown that the ability to control the spread of a new pathogen is influenced by the proportion of transmission that occurs before the onset of overt symptoms or through asymptomatic infection.",PMC3291053,PMC3291053_1
"In the context of political commitment, questions remain about the level of political commitment countries will demonstrate in implementing IHR 2005. The IHR 1969 suffered because state parties frequently failed to report notifiable diseases and routinely applied excessive trade and travel restrictions. The relevance of such trade and travel concerns was most recently illustrated during the SARS pandemic through China's initial fears that disclosing the pandemic would harm its economy and foreign trade.",PMC3291053,PMC3291053_2
"In the context of resource challenges, the demands of IHR 2005 surveillance obligations will confront many countries, particularly developing countries, with resource challenges. IHR 2005 does not include financing mechanisms, which leaves each state party to bear the financial costs of improving its own local, intermediate, and national level surveillance capabilities.",PMC3291053,PMC3291053_3
"In the context of uncertainty, uncertainty lingers as to whether the obligations specified in IHR 2005 will fare better in terms of state party compliance than similar ones in IHR 1969. Conclusion: Establishing effective global public health surveillance is at the heart of IHR 2005, and evaluating the surveillance system specified by IHR 2005 is necessary to understand the potential for this new set of international legal rules to contribute to global health governance. However, turning the blueprint detailed in IHR 2005 into functional architecture that benefits all is one of the great public health challenges of the first decades of the 21st century, and the obstacles complicating this challenge, including lack of financial resources to upgrade surveillance systems, especially in developing countries, will be",PMC3291053,PMC3291053_4
