"The RAFT program, implemented at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, Canada, significantly reduced the time to diagnosis for febrile returned travelers, allowing for closer follow-up and reduced workload in the emergency department. Over 78% of patients were seen at the RAFT clinic, with a 72% reduction in repeat ED visits and 288 hours of ED bed usage averted.",PMC4985841,PMC4985841_0
"Adherence to national guidelines for assessment of febrile returned travelers was generally good, with respiratory tract infections being the second most common presentation among this group of febrile returned travelers, including eight cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza.",PMC4985841,PMC4985841_1
"The RAFT program allowed for more timely care to be provided to ambulatory febrile returned travelers, filling a gap in care faced by such travelers prior to implementation of the program. It also reduced ED bed usage by providing an alternate setting for follow-up malaria screening and offloaded the responsibility for treatment of infectious diseases that can be managed in an outpatient setting from the ED.",PMC4985841,PMC4985841_2
"The program underscored the range of febrile illnesses that are imported to Canada by travelers on a daily basis, reinforcing the need to combine history, physical examination, and a minimum set of laboratory investigations to exclude potentially life-threatening imported illnesses such as malaria and bacteremia.",PMC4985841,PMC4985841_3
"The program highlighted the need for a thorough sexual and behavioral history, especially in the context of known disinhibition on the part of travelers, as common STIs including secondary syphilis, acute HIV, acute HSV1 or HSV2, and gonococcemia can all lead to fever in the returned traveler with a compatible history and clinical picture.",PMC4985841,PMC4985841_4
