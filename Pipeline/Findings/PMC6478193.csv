"During 2014-2017, 264 detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses were identified in poultry across 20 states.",PMC6478193,PMC6478193_0
"Of the 4,555 responders potentially exposed to these viruses, 23 became ill and were tested, but no human infections with avian influenza viruses were detected.",PMC6478193,PMC6478193_1
"The risk for infection with avian influenza for responders varied by year and virus, but was generally low.",PMC6478193,PMC6478193_2
"In response to the outbreaks of infection with North American wild bird lineage HPAI viruses in poultry during 2016 and 2017, CDC and USDA revised recommendations for monitoring illness in responders.",PMC6478193,PMC6478193_3
"When responding to HPAI viruses similar to those previously encountered in the US, passive monitoring is recommended for persons wearing adequate PPE. For response personnel with inadequate or no PPE, or after experiencing a breach of PPE, active monitoring is recommended. If personnel are responding to an avian influenza virus of unknown origin, active monitoring is recommended during exposure and for 10 days postexposure, regardless of PPE use.",PMC6478193,PMC6478193_4
