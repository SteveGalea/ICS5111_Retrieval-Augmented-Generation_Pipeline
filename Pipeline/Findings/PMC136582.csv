"The np gene of ndv, which is already engaged in performing multiple essential functions throughout the virus cycle, can be engineered to fulfill additional functions, such as displaying foreign epitopes and inducing protective immunity against unrelated pathogens.",PMC136582,PMC136582_0
"Deletion of the complete helix peak in the np gene of velogenic strain of ndv did not prevent the generation of infectious recombinant ndv, while deletion of a partial helix structure in ndv-δ12 did not lead to the recovery of infectious ndv.",PMC136582,PMC136582_1
Replacement of np sequence (amino acids 444 to 459) with an equivalent number of mhv amino acids or replacement of 12 amino acids at positions 444 to 455 of the np with 10 amino acids comprising the 5b19 mhv epitope resulted in genetically stable viruses expressing foreign epitopes.,PMC136582,PMC136582_2
"All chickens vaccinated with ndv-δ18, ndv-mhv1, or ndv-mhv2 completely lacked antibodies directed against the deleted ide as determined by 18-mer np-peptide-based elisa, while all sera from animals immunized with conventional live or inactivated vaccines were positive with the np peptide elisa, indicating 100% sensitivity and specificity of the test at least under laboratory conditions.",PMC136582,PMC136582_3
"Recombinant vectors, such as herpesvirus of turkey (hvt) and fowlpox virus expressing ndv f and/or hn, have been successfully constructed and their safety and efficacy have been studied, and administration of a combined np-based live marker ndv vaccine with a vector vaccine, for instance hvt expressing f and/or hn, into day-old chickens will have an advantage in providing long-lasting local and systemic immunity and avoids the necessity of revaccination and repeated handling of chickens.",PMC136582,PMC136582_4
