"The study found that only 25% of sampled practices (n=913) were using their web sites to disseminate zika virus information in January 2016, and this number increased to 36% in August 2016. However, the proportion of practices posting zika virus information on their social media accounts decreased from January to August, with 15% of practices posting in January versus 9% in August for Facebook, and 12% versus 8% in August for Twitter.",PMC5636051,PMC5636051_0
"The study found that only 14% of practices posted advice on the use of insect repellent during the August data collection period, which was a decrease of 1% from the January data collection period. Similarly, a decrease in the proportion of practices posting travel advisories was seen, with 21% posting information about travel advisories in January compared with only 14% in August.",PMC5636051,PMC5636051_1
"The study found that in August 2016, only 5% of practices offered zika virus information in Spanish, and this number did not significantly differ between the January and August data collection periods.",PMC5636051,PMC5636051_2
"The study found that practices affiliated with hospital systems (either university-affiliated or nonâ€“university-affiliated) were significantly more likely to post zika virus information in any location during both the January and August data collection periods, compared with practices that were ""ob-gyn-only"" (i.e., practices with a focus on obstetrics and gynecology).",PMC5636051,PMC5636051_3
"The study highlights the need for public health organizations to emphasize the importance of continually promoting the most effective risk-reduction behaviors, no matter how ""common,"" as the low proportion of web sites posting zika virus information and the decrease in observed content themes over time may be due to a provider's inability to dedicate the necessary time and resources to maintaining an updated practice web site, as larger, hospital-affiliated practices were significantly more likely to post content about zika virus. The study also suggests the need for public health organizations to be mindful of the potential information overload or confusion over what to post for providers, as the most well-designed patient-centered public health communication materials may never be utilized by the majority of providers if posting the content on their web sites is not easy.
