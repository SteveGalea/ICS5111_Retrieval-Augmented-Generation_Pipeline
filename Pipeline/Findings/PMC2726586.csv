"The authors identified two different human naive Fab antibodies, HA1 and HA2, that specifically recognize the CD22 antigen in both its soluble and membrane-bound forms.",PMC2726586,PMC2726586_0
The Fab HA2 antibody was shown to have a higher affinity for CD22 than the Fab HA1 antibody.,PMC2726586,PMC2726586_1
The authors successfully isolated a panel of anti-CD22 antibodies from a human naive Fab library using two different panning procedures.,PMC2726586,PMC2726586_2
"The authors were able to purify a CD22 sub-domain containing ig-like domains 1 and 2, which was used to select antibodies targeting this region.",PMC2726586,PMC2726586_3
"The authors demonstrated that the HA2 Fab antibody has a higher affinity for CD22 than the HA1 Fab antibody, as evidenced by flow cytometry analysis of CD22-expressing cells.",PMC2726586,PMC2726586_4
