"The study reports the discovery of a new coronavirus, named hcov-nl63, which was identified in pigs in the Netherlands. This virus is closely related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), both of which are known to cause diarrhea and vomiting in pigs.",PMC538260,PMC538260_0
The study found that hcov-nl63 shares approximately 86% nucleotide sequence identity with TGEV and PEDV in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome. This suggests a potential common origin for these viruses.,PMC538260,PMC538260_1
"The study also identified the complete genome sequence of hcov-nl63, which is deposited in the GenBank under accession number nc_005831.",PMC538260,PMC538260_2
The study found that the core sequence of the leader (L) region in the genome of hcov-nl63 is presented in the single-stranded loop of the viral RNA in a similar manner as seen in TGEV and PEDV.,PMC538260,PMC538260_3
"The study reports the discovery that the core body (B) region and the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of hcov-nl63 share approximately 98% nucleotide sequence identity with TGEV and PEDV, respectively. This finding further supports the close relationship between hcov-nl63, TGEV, and PEDV.",PMC538260,PMC538260_4
