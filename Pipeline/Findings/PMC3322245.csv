"In response to infection with the Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, cells form stress granules (SGs) that contain the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein and promote viral replication. RVF is a single-stranded RNA virus, and its N protein is required for viral replication and the formation of SGs. The formation of SGs is dependent on the activation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and the phosphorylation of eIF2α, a process that is also necessary for viral replication. The presence of the N protein in SGs suggests a role for RVF in the formation and function of SGs.",PMC3322245,PMC3322245_0
"Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces SG formation, but the mechanism of SG induction is not fully understood. HCV RNA binding protein (HCV-BP) and HCV IRES element-binding protein (HCV-IBP) are required for HCV replication and are found in SGs. The presence of these proteins in SGs suggests a role for HCV in the formation and function of SGs.",PMC3322245,PMC3322245_1
"Infection with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) induces the formation of antiviral granules (AVGs) that contain viral RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and translation initiation factors. AVGs are distinct from typical SGs and do not contain translationally silenced messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The formation of AVGs is linked to the activation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and the phosphorylation of eIF2α, which is required for viral replication. The presence of RBPs and initiation factors in AVGs suggests a role for VSV in the formation and function of AVGs.",PMC3322245,PMC3322245_2
"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inhibits SG formation through the expression of the viral accessory protein Vpr. Vpr interacts with the cellular protein Cks1p36, which is required for SG formation. The inhibition of SG formation by Vpr is dependent on the expression of the viral protein",PMC3322245,PMC3322245_3
