"Bat type I III interferon receptor (IFNAR) genes, IFNλR1 and IL10R2, share similar genomic organization and high conservation with human and mouse IFNAR genes, but show considerable variation in expression between tissues in bats, similar to humans and xenopus, with small intestine and spleen having relatively higher expression of IFNλR1 compared to other organs.",PMC3181264,PMC3181264_0
"Bat IFNλR1 is capable of responding to stimulation with IFN-λ, providing evidence that it is a functional receptor. Bat splenocytes, which are a rich source of immune cells, display a high IFNλR1 expression and respond to IFN-λ treatment with the induction of rig-i and ISG56. However, in the absence of specific cell markers to characterize bat immune cells, it is currently unknown which populations of cells express IFNλR1 and respond to IFN-λ.",PMC3181264,PMC3181264_1
"Bat IFNλR1 and IL10R2 share similar genomic organization and high conservation with other mammalian IFNAR genes, but no alternative splice variants of IFNλR1 were identified in bats, despite extensive screening of spleen and thymus RNA by RT-PCR. The absence of such variants with the ability to downregulate the IFN-λ response may lead to a more pronounced IFN response in bat cells.",PMC3181264,PMC3181264_2
"Bat IFNλR1 is expressed in all tissues tested, however, considerable variation exists between tissues with small intestine and spleen having relatively higher expression of IFNλR1 compared to other organs. The three hematopoietic organs tested, PBMC, spleen and lymph nodes, displayed the highest IFNλR1 expression, likely reflecting its role as a receptor for a number of cytokines. This expression pattern correlates with the pattern of TLR7, 8 and 9 expression in bats. At the cellular level, bat IFNλR1 is capable of responding to stimulation with IFN-λ, providing evidence that it is a functional receptor. Bat spleen cells, which are a rich source of immune cells, display a high IFNλR1 expression and responded to IFN-λ treatment with the induction of rig-",PMC3181264,PMC3181264_3
