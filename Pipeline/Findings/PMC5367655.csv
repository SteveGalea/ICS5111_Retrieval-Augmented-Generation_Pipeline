"In the section on serum protease activity, the authors found that the activity of the protease ace2 is inversely associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with well-preserved eGFR (eGFR â‰¥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) had higher ace2 activity compared to patients with lower eGFR. This finding suggests that reduced eGFR may be associated with decreased ace2 activity, potentially as a compensatory mechanism to counteract disease-associated induction of the classical renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) axis.",PMC5367655,PMC5367655_0
"The authors also found that the activity of the protease dpp4 is negatively associated with eGFR in patients with CKD. Patients with lower eGFR had higher dpp4 activity compared to patients with higher eGFR. This finding suggests that increased eGFR may be associated with decreased dpp4 activity, potentially as a result of altered RAAS activity or other pathophysiological conditions.",PMC5367655,PMC5367655_1
"In the same section, the authors noted that the activity of several other serum peptidases, including ace, enpep, and npepps, did not show a significant association with eGFR in patients with CKD. However, further studies are needed to fully elucidate the role of serum ectopeptidases in the pathogenesis of CKD and underlying molecular mechanisms.",PMC5367655,PMC5367655_2
"The authors also found that the activity of the protease dpp4, but not the activity of several other serum peptidases, was associated with age and sex in some studies, suggesting that the specific response to diverse pathophysiological conditions may depend on age and sex.",PMC5367655,PMC5367655_3
"The authors noted that the activity of the protease ace2 and dpp4, but not the activity of several other serum peptidases, was associated with eGFR in patients with CKD, potentially as a result of altered RAAS activity or other pathophysiological conditions. However, further studies are needed to test whether these enzymatic activities are truly associated with eGFR and to identify the precise role of serum ectopeptidases in the pathogenesis of CKD",PMC5367655,PMC5367655_4
