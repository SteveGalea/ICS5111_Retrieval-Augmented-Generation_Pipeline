"The extract from the flowers of p. Fortunei (epf) contains high amounts of flavonoids, such as apigenin, luteolin, rutin, and hesperetin, which have been shown to have anti-obesity, anti-hyperglycemic, and hypolipidemic effects in previous studies.",PMC5622719,PMC5622719_0
"Epf supplementation in high-fat diet (hfd)-induced obese mice for eight weeks decreased body weight gain, liver weight, and liver triglyceride content in a dose-dependent manner, as well as lowered serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) levels.",PMC5622719,PMC5622719_1
"Epf supplementation also down-regulated the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (srebp-1c), a key transcription factor involved in the control of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, and its downstream molecule insulin receptor substrate 1 (irs-1) in livers of hfd mice, as well as up-regulated the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (cpt1), a key enzyme involved in the rate-limiting step of hepatic fatty acid Î²-oxidation.",PMC5622719,PMC5622719_2
"Epf supplementation partially or completely prevented all the alterations associated with hfd consumption, suggesting that epf might be a natural flavonoid-rich extract and the activator of irs-1, which in turn regulates the expression of downstream genes involved in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism to lower blood glucose and lipid.",PMC5622719,PMC5622719_3
These findings emphasize the importance of dietary intervention in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases induced by hfd.,PMC5622719,PMC5622719_4
