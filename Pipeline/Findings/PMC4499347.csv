The study constructed tumor vaccines by covalent attachment of mg7-ag and a tlr7 agonist (t7).,PMC4499347,PMC4499347_0
Conjugation of t7 with an mg7-ag tri-epitope (t7-mg3) significantly increased the release of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin (il)-12 in bone marrow dendritic cells and interferon-γ and il-12 in mouse lymphocytes in vitro.,PMC4499347,PMC4499347_1
"Immunization with t7-mg3 was efficacious in reversing tolerance and generating therapeutic response in ehrlich ascites carcinoma-bearing mice, through enhancing specific humoral and cellular immunity, which were displayed as higher antibody titers, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, cytotoxic t lymphocyte activity.",PMC4499347,PMC4499347_2
"Although a simple commixture of t7 and mg3 was able to inhibit tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice because of the immune enhancement, the effects of t7-mg3 were greater, especially on the induction of cytotoxic t lymphocytes.",PMC4499347,PMC4499347_3
"However, vaccines with an mg7-ag mono-epitope showed no significant effect on either the promotion of immunity or the reduction of tumor size.",PMC4499347,PMC4499347_4
