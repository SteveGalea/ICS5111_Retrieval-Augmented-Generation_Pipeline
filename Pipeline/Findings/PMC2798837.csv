"In a study following rats for 21 days after dosing with complete Freund adjuvant, haptoglobin increased nearly 700% of normal values within 12 hours. This increase occurred concurrently with a significant decrease in albumin and increases in α2 and β globulins, as quantitated by protein electrophoresis (PE). Alterations in globulin, albumin, and haptoglobin concentration continued to be present until day 21, when normal levels were observed in all parameters.",PMC2798837,PMC2798837_0
"In a retrospective evaluation of inflammatory conditions in dogs, app showed significant changes in the absence of changes in the total or differential white blood cell count. App also showed significant changes in dogs with naturally occurring bacterial infection, with haptoglobin having 85% sensitivity and specificity compared with 52% sensitivity and 75% specificity of white blood cell counts in those animals with bacterial infection.",PMC2798837,PMC2798837_1
"In a study of naturally occurring babesiosis in dogs, crp levels were significantly higher in dogs with severe or complicated disease.",PMC2798837,PMC2798837_2
"In a study of canine leishmaniasis, crp was increased in symptomatic but not asymptomatic animals.",PMC2798837,PMC2798837_3
"In a study of dogs with pyometra before and after surgical sterilization, crp, haptoglobin, and saa values in dogs with pyometra peaked within 24 hours after surgery and then declined slowly in dogs that recovered without complications.",PMC2798837,PMC2798837_4
