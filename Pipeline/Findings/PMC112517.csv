"Mice lacking both functional type I and II interferon (IFN) receptors (ar129 mice) are unable to control systemic dissemination of the highly attenuated pseudorabies virus (ge−tk−prv), despite high levels of IFN-γ and interleukin (IL)-6 in their sera.",PMC112517,PMC112517_0
"Mice lacking both functional IFN-α/β and IFN-γ receptors (agr129 mice) are also unable to control ge−tk−prv replication, but specific lymphocytes induced and antiviral antibodies (abs) produced in these mice are capable of inhibiting virus replication between days 3 and 14.",PMC112517,PMC112517_1
"Mice lacking both functional IFN-α/β and IFN-γ receptors (agr129 mice) are unable to control ge−tk−prv replication early after infection, but specific lymphocytes induced and antiviral abs produced in these mice are capable of inhibiting virus replication between days 3 and 14.",PMC112517,PMC112517_2
"Mice lacking both functional IFN-α/β and IFN-γ receptors (agr129 mice) have higher efficiency with which ge−tk−prv can replicate in the IFN-receptor-deficient host compared to ge−tk−prv in wild-type mice, but ag129 mice infected with ge–tk−prv were unable to control ge–tk−prv replication before 3 days post-infection.",PMC112517,PMC112517_3
"Mice lacking both functional IFN-α/β and IFN-γ receptors (agr129 mice) have higher efficiency with which ge–tk−prv can replicate in the IFN-receptor-deficient host compared to ge–tk−prv in wild-type mice, but specific lymphocytes induced and antiviral abs produced in these mice are capable of inhibiting virus replication between days 3 and 14.",PMC112517,PMC112517_4
