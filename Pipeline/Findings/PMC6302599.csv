"Two distinct felv outbreaks were recorded in the Florida panther population during 2001-2016, with felv-pco resulting from initial spillover from domestic cats, presumably during a predator event. Three independent isolates of felv-pco were identified in Florida panthers, and a third felv strain might be present in contemporary samples and represented by partial felv sequences derived from one panther.",PMC6302599,PMC6302599_0
"Felv-b, a recombinant of felv-a and enfelv, an endogenous retrovirus harbored only by members of the genus felis, was identified and sequenced in a contemporary Florida panther. This finding is of concern because felv-b is oncogenic and associated with increased illness and death in domestic cats, and felv-b horizontal transmission has been described only on three previous occasions.",PMC6302599,PMC6302599_1
"Felv infection of panthers and other non-felis cat species is a greater concern for long-term population effects, as infection with this virus has also led to higher incidence of secondary infections, such as chlamydiosis and neoplasias, and early endogenization might result in decreased fitness.",PMC6302599,PMC6302599_2
Annual sampling of a proportion of the Florida panther population that is sufficient to detect an felv incidence of 3% with relative certainty and increased vaccination of panthers and domestic cats along sites of potential interaction are recommended measures to protect against future outbreaks.,PMC6302599,PMC6302599_3
"Movement of felv from cats would represent a greater risk for endangered non-felis cat species, as felv-b is oncogenic and associated with increased illness and death in domestic cats, and felv-b horizontal transmission has been described only on three previous occasions.",PMC6302599,PMC6302599_4
