"Bovine coronavirus (BCV) was identified and confirmed as an early type of infection among commingled calves in this study. Calves from two different groups in the study, representing sick and healthy animals, were found to have BCV infections in nasal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) virus isolations from sick calves in the first 4 days after arrival, but not from calves in the fifth to fourteenth days after arrival.",PMC3122965,PMC3122965_0
The study also demonstrated the recovery of BCV from some healthy calves as well.,PMC3122965,PMC3122965_1
The levels of BCV-neutralizing antibodies in ranch-raised calves upon entry to the feedlot were found to be predictive of whether a calf might be treated for clinical BRD in the feedlot after arrival. Calves with very low levels of BCV-neutralizing antibodies (â‰¤ 16) were more likely to be treated than calves with higher levels.,PMC3122965,PMC3122965_2
"The study identified and confirmed that BCV is an early type of infection among the commingled calves, and that BCV is recovered from lung samples (BAL) in addition to nasal swabs. This finding suggests that BCV may play a role in lung lesions such as pneumonias.",PMC3122965,PMC3122965_3
"The study identified varied levels of BCV immunity among beef-breeding herds. This is an important aspect of the study as it demonstrates again that calves entering the marketing channel where they may mix with calves from different sources may become infected during the process of sale and delivery to the feedlot or during backgrounding operations. The study suggests that BCV immunoprophylaxis (delivery of vaccines) would be best for the calves before weaning, giving them sufficient time to gain active immunity before commingling with other cattle.",PMC3122965,PMC3122965_4
