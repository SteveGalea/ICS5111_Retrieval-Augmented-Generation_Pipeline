"Swine ifitms, including swifitm1 to -5, are upregulated by type I interferon and influenza virus infection in porcine cells.",PMC4301123,PMC4301123_0
"Swine ifitms, such as swifitm1a and -1b, display plasma membrane localization, while swine ifitm2 and -3 are found to colocalize with a marker for late endosomes.",PMC4301123,PMC4301123_1
"Overexpression of swine ifitms results in reduced influenza virus reporter activity and reduced viral titers, with swifitm2 and swifitm3 displaying the strongest antiviral activities.",PMC4301123,PMC4301123_2
Endogenous swine ifitms also contribute to the antiviral activity of type I interferon in porcine cells.,PMC4301123,PMC4301123_3
Further studies can examine the antiviral potential of swine ifitms from different swine breeds to identify pig breeds with increased resistance to influenza virus infections.,PMC4301123,PMC4301123_4
