"Dominant negative mek-1 expression significantly enhanced hcv replication, indicating the involvement of the mek/erk signaling pathway in hcv replication.",PMC2759292,PMC2759292_0
"Inhibition of mek signaling by pharmacological agents increased hcv gene expression and plus-strand rna synthesis, suggesting the involvement of the mek/erk signaling pathway in hcv replication.",PMC2759292,PMC2759292_1
"Blockage of mek/erk signaling by dominant negative mek-1 expression significantly enhanced hcv replication, ruling out the possibility that these inhibitors or dominant negatives enhanced hcv replication by interfering with the ifn-Î± anti-viral response.",PMC2759292,PMC2759292_2
"Serially diluted in vitro transcribed hcv rnas were used as standards for real-time rt-pcr quantitation to quantify hcv rna in the supernatants, and a positive correlation among the increase in hcv proteins, plus-strand rna accumulation in the cells, and hcv production in the culture supernatant was observed, supporting the notion that targeting mek/erk signaling as therapeutic intervention to treat hepatocellular carcinoma may lead to acceleration of hcv pathogenic process.",PMC2759292,PMC2759292_3
"The mek/erk signaling pathway regulates hcv ires translational activity but has no effects on the cap-dependent translation, suggesting that the hcv ires translational machinery can be specifically targeted with pharmacological agents without affecting the host translational system.",PMC2759292,PMC2759292_4
