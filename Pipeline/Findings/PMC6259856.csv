"The study identified three novel targeted sites for si-n gene specific siRNAs: si-n213, si-n863, and si-n1240.",PMC6259856,PMC6259856_0
"The study found that si-n213 and si-n863 were more effective in inhibiting n gene expression than si-n#16, which targets a 12 nucleotide deletion region in the n gene.",PMC6259856,PMC6259856_1
"The study also observed that si-n1240, which targets the 3' terminal sequence of the n gene, was similarly effective in inhibiting n gene expression as si-n#16.",PMC6259856,PMC6259856_2
"The study demonstrated that sars-cov n gene products were able to enhance infÎ² production, and n gene specific siRNAs could functionally reduce this enhancement.",PMC6259856,PMC6259856_3
"The study identified structural differences between vector expressed n mRNA and virus derived subgenomic n mRNAs, which might contribute to discrepancies observed in si-n gene specific siRNA efficacy compared to a previous report.",PMC6259856,PMC6259856_4
