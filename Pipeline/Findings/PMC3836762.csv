"A one-step sybr green i-based quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was developed for the rapid detection of hantavirus (HTNV) infection in clinical samples. This assay allows for the amplification of specific HTNV products, as well as the detection of other viruses such as Hantaan (HTNV, HTNII, HTNVIII), hantan orthohantaviruses (HTNV-V, HTNV-VI, HTNV-VII), and Sin Nombre Grande (SNG) viruses (SNG-I, SNG-II, SNG-III) using the same amplifying primers and reaction conditions. The detection limit of the qRT-PCR was determined using 10-fold serial dilutions of HTNV CRNA ranging from 1×106 to 1×10-1 copies/μl in duplicate.",PMC3836762,PMC3836762_0
"The qRT-PCR assay was optimized by testing different parameters such as the gradient of annealing temperature (ranging from 51°C to 61°C), the gradient of primer concentrations, and amounts of CRNA templates in 25 μl of reaction volume.",PMC3836762,PMC3836762_1
"The reproducibility of the assay was evaluated by assaying serial dilutions of HTNV CRNA standards ranging from 1×107 to 1×101 copies/μl to evaluate intra-assay variance, and three independent HTNV CRNA dilutions were tested in a single run to evaluate inter-assay variance.",PMC3836762,PMC3836762_2
"The standard curve was plotted as the mean CT values versus the log HTNV CRNA copy numbers. The regression analysis, standard curve slopes, and amplification efficiencies were calculated using automated software (Bio-Rad iQ5 2.0 Standard Edition Optical System Software).",PMC3836762,PMC3836762_3
"A standard curve was generated using the qRT-PCR assay for the construction of a standard curve, 10-fold serial dilutions of the HTNV CRNA standards spanning 1×108 to 1×103 copies/μl in easy dilution (Takara Bio Technology, Dalian, China).",PMC3836762,PMC3836762_4
