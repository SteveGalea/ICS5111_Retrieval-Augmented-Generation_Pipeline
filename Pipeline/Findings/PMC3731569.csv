"A structural study of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and its interaction with the cellular receptor, human dipeptidase 4 (DPP4), has been reported. The study revealed that the RBD of MERS-CoV is distinct from that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, with a lower affinity for DPP4. The structural differences in RBD and DPP4 are expected to contribute to the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and may guide the development of therapeutics against this virus.",PMC3731569,PMC3731569_0
"The study also showed that a mutation in the RBD of MERS-CoV, K48R, significantly impaired its binding to DPP4, suggesting that this mutation may contribute to the virulence and/or transmission of MERS-CoV.",PMC3731569,PMC3731569_1
"In addition, the study identified a potential therapeutic target, a region in DPP4 that is not involved in SARS-CoV binding but is critical for MERS-CoV binding. This finding provides a novel approach for the development of therapeutics against MERS-CoV.",PMC3731569,PMC3731569_2
"The study also demonstrated that soluble RBD and DPP4 can inhibit MERS-CoV infection, providing a proof-of-concept for the development of RBD- and DPP4-based therapeutics against MERS-CoV.",PMC3731569,PMC3731569_3
"Furthermore, the study provided insights into the structural features that are important for the interaction between RBD and DPP4, which will aid in the design of RBD- and DPP4-based therapeutics against MERS-CoV.",PMC3731569,PMC3731569_4
