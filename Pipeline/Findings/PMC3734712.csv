"In the pre-clinical study conducted by the authors, they developed a rabies vaccine using a recombinant DNA technology, and it was found to be safe and effective in rhesus monkeys. The study involved sub-chronic and chronic toxicity evaluations, immunogenicity and immunotoxicology testing, and organ necropsy and histopathology analysis. The vaccine was found to be safe at a 10-fold higher dose than the therapeutic dose, and there was no evidence of anti-dsDNA or anti-nuclear antibodies in the serum of animals on day 120 post-exposure.",PMC3734712,PMC3734712_0
"The study also found that the vaccine induced a maximum immune stimulating response at the highest dose, but no adverse reactions were observed at this dose, suggesting the safety of the test material.",PMC3734712,PMC3734712_1
"The authors noted that the safety evaluation of biological products, including biotechnology-manufactured substances, requires relevant species with appropriate immunological response. They selected rhesus monkeys, a non-human primate, as the species for safety evaluation because of their relative affinity, distribution of receptors for the intended clinical product, and appropriate immunological response.",PMC3734712,PMC3734712_2
"The study found that there was no evidence of any exaggerated responses in lymphoid tissues in the animals exposed to the vaccine, even after 120 days post-exposure, suggesting the safety of the test material.",PMC3734712,PMC3734712_3
"The authors noted that the presence of residual DNA at the site of injection in one female monkey exposed to the vaccine was present in traces, which is unlikely to integrate into the host genome due to the sensitivity of the PCR analysis, which is to determine the presence of residual DNA in femtograms. This finding adds to the existing data on the evaluation of DNA products as preventive/therapeutic agents in clinical conditions.",PMC3734712,PMC3734712_4
