"Skempi 2.0 is a comprehensive database containing over 2,000 experimentally determined changes in binding affinity upon single, double, or triple mutations, as well as the effects of these mutations on other higher order interaction terms, for a wide variety of protein-protein interactions, enzyme-substrate interactions, and other biologically relevant molecular interactions.",PMC6361233,PMC6361233_0
"The database includes entries from over 295 publications, spanning many biological processes, including protein-ligand, protein-protein, and enzyme-substrate interactions, as well as interactions between nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and other biologically relevant molecular interactions.",PMC6361233,PMC6361233_1
"Skempi 2.0 contains entries with affinities ranging from picomolar to millimolar, including over 1,000 entries with affinities below 100 nM, and over 150 entries with affinities below 10 nM.",PMC6361233,PMC6361233_2
"The database includes entries for interactions between residues, the dependence of these interactions on other residues, and other higher order effects, such as double mutant cubes, constructed from the energies of the wild-type, four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants and the quadruple mutant, as well as higher cycles containing triple mutant cubes, constructed from the energies of the wild-type, four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants and the quadruple mutant.",PMC6361233,PMC6361233_3
"Skempi 2.0 also contains over 610 double mutant cycles, including over 530 cycles with additive binding energies and over 293 cycles with non-additive binding energies, exhibiting tighter binding in the double mutant than the sum of the two single mutants (positive epistasis), weaker binding in the presence of the background mutation but otherwise stronger binding than the wild-type (stabilizing sign epistasis), and weaker binding in the mutant background but otherwise stronger binding than the wild-type (destabilizing sign epistasis), as well as over 345 cycles with synergistic and antagonistic positive and negative epistasis.",PMC6361233,PMC6361233_4
"Skempi 2.0 also provides higher order interaction terms, such as triple mutant",PMC6361233,PMC6361233_5
