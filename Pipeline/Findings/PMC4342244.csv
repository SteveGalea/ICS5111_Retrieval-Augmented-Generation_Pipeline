"VLPs, when injected post-exposure, significantly accelerate the onset of isg induction in Ebola-infected mice, allowing for timely establishment of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory states.",PMC4342244,PMC4342244_0
"VLPs trigger early induction of negative regulatory isgs, which limits excess inflammatory responses and allows for maturation of antigen presentation function, resulting in robust adaptive immune responses.",PMC4342244,PMC4342244_1
"VLPs provide post-exposure protection against Ebola infection by relieving Ebola's antagonism against type I interferons, resulting in reduced systemic inflammation and subsequent enhancement in acquired immune responses.",PMC4342244,PMC4342244_2
"The transcription factor Irf8 is required for VLP-mediated post-exposure protection against Ebola infection, as it amplifies type I interferon gene induction and boosts interferon biological activities.",PMC4342244,PMC4342244_3
"VLPs augment type I interferon-responsive genes via Irf8-dependent manner in Ebola-infected mice, leading to reduced viral replication and inflammatory gene expression.",PMC4342244,PMC4342244_4
