"GroEL, a molecular adjuvant derived from Escherichia coli, significantly enhances antibody responses against glycoprotein hormone receptors (GPCRs), which are challenging targets for antibody induction. Dna immunization with GroEL as an adjuvant resulted in strong, specific antibody responses against the full-length endothelin A receptor (ETAR) in mice, whereas co-injection of plasmids encoding ETAR and GroEL resulted in lower antibody responses than the ETAR-GroEL plasmid. This finding suggests that GroEL may be capable of producing antibodies against most GPCRs.",PMC4855071,PMC4855071_0
"Dna immunization is an efficient method for testing different immunogen designs. Dna immunization allows for rapid testing of different immunogen designs and can be used to generate high-quality mAbs against challenging targets such as GPCRs, multi-transmembrane proteins, and intracellular proteins.",PMC4855071,PMC4855071_1
"Dna immunization does not require the production or purification of proteins from a pathogen, which avoids any issues related to biosafety. This finding makes dna immunization an attractive approach for producing high-quality mAbs against conformation-sensitive targets, especially for emerging infectious agents once the pathogen gene sequence is known.",PMC4855071,PMC4855071_2
"Dna immunization offers a unique approach for generating mAbs in both mouse and rabbit models, as well as in human volunteers. Dna immunization has been used to generate mAbs from human volunteers via a single B cell cloning method, demonstrating its effectiveness in a wide range of hosts.",PMC4855071,PMC4855071_3
"Dna immunization offers unique advantages for producing high-quality mAbs. These advantages include the ability to induce higher-level antigen-specific B cell responses, the use of a heterologous prime-boost approach, and the ability to produce high-quality mAbs against challenging targets such as conformation-sensitive targets. Dna immunization can also be used to generate mAbs in a wide range of hosts, including mouse, rabbit, and human.",PMC4855071,PMC4855071_4
"Final boost immunization, which is commonly used to produce high-quality mAbs, can be achieved through protein injection or through the use of cells as a boosting reagent. Purified prote",PMC4855071,PMC4855071_5
