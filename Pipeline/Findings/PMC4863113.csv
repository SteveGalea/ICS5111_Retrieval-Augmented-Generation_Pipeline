"Nbaecp, a nonberberine active ingredient from the traditional Chinese medicine C. Phellodendri, can inhibit high K+-induced precontractions in healthy and asthmatic airway smooth muscle by inhibiting l-type Ca2+ channels.",PMC4863113,PMC4863113_0
"Nbaecp can also inhibit precontractions in small bronchial smooth muscle, indicating its potential as a bronchodilator for asthmatics.",PMC4863113,PMC4863113_1
"Nbaecp partially inhibits Ach-induced contractions in airway smooth muscle by inhibiting l-type Ca2+ channels and trpc3 and/or stim/orai channels, but the exact inhibitory mechanism requires further investigation.",PMC4863113,PMC4863113_2
"Nbaecp has similar inhibitory roles in both healthy and asthmatic airway smooth muscle, suggesting its potential as a new inhibitor of asthma attacks.",PMC4863113,PMC4863113_3
"Nbaecp can inhibit whole airway smooth muscle contractions, as shown by experiments conducted in both healthy and asthmatic smooth muscles.",PMC4863113,PMC4863113_4
