"The study identified two compounds, nitazoxanide and 2cmc, as potent inhibitors of feline calicivirus (fcv) replication in cell culture at low micromolar concentrations with a potential combinational therapeutic utility to treat fcv-infected cats.",PMC6116245,PMC6116245_0
"Nitazoxanide, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound, displayed an ec50 of 0.2 µg/ml (0.6 μm) against fcv, which is within the range of values found when tested against other viruses. This drug is currently in clinical trials to treat norovirus gastroenteritis in humans and has been commercially used to treat intestinal parasites in small animals such as cats and dogs.",PMC6116245,PMC6116245_1
"The study demonstrated the successful use of nitazoxanide in eliminating the shedding of Trichomonas foetus, a cause of chronic diarrhea in cats. However, considering the narrow in vitro therapeutic index of nitazoxanide and its side-effects (diarrhea and vomiting) observed in cats after nitazoxanide administration, concerns about the effective dose in vivo should be addressed.",PMC6116245,PMC6116245_2
"The study identified quercetagetin and ppnds as potent rdrp inhibitors against fcv, with ic50 values in the low micromolar range. Quercetagetin has previously shown a potent inhibition against the proteases of norovirus, coronaviruses, and picornaviruses, with ic50s ranging from 0.20 to 4.35 µm.",PMC6116245,PMC6116245_3
"The study reported the identification of two compounds, nitazoxanide and 2cmc, as having antiviral activity against fcv in cell culture at low micromolar concentrations with a potential combinational therapeutic utility to treat fcv-infected cats. The combination of antiviral compounds with additive or synergistic effects is a strategy to improve drug efficacy, reduce antiviral toxicity, and limit the development of viral resistance. Here, the combination of nitazoxanide and 2cmc in cell cultures had a synergistic inhibitory effect against fcv, with an average delta",PMC6116245,PMC6116245_4
