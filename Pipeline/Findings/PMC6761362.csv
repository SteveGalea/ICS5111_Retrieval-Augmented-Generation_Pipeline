"Providers and respiratory therapists, who often perform physical examinations and respiratory treatments, have a significantly higher number of self-contacts than HCWs with other roles, with the mask and torso being the most commonly touched body parts by HCWs.",PMC6761362,PMC6761362_2
"The patient room surfaces, including bed surfaces, bed rails, IV pole, computer station, and tray table, are frequently touched by both HCWs and patients, highlighting the potential for pathogen transmission via environmental surfaces.",PMC6761362,PMC6761362_3
"The duration of HCW-patient encounters, ranging from 1 to 17 minutes with a median of 13 minutes, is lower than previously reported, potentially due to the nature of care activities being observed.",PMC6761362,PMC6761362_4
