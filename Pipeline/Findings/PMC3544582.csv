"The study found that school-level transmission of influenza, as measured by classroom-based fever surveillance using fri reporting by teachers, is more common than school-wide transmission, as measured by daily monitoring of temperature in schools. This finding suggests that classroom-level transmission may dominate, and that fri reporting by teachers in schools could be a useful method for detecting transmission clusters during future pandemics or severe seasonal influenza epidemics.",PMC3544582,PMC3544582_0
"The study also revealed wide-spread variation in fri rates at the level of classrooms, but not schools. This finding highlights the potential accuracy and usefulness of fri reporting by teachers in schools for monitoring influenza epidemics and may be particularly useful in resource-poor settings due to the minimal costs involved.",PMC3544582,PMC3544582_1
The study further revealed that notifications of laboratory-confirmed influenza (sch-lcc) and school-wide daily monitoring of temperature (sch-dtm) were unlikely to have detected a sufficient fraction of influenza cases to allow effective school-level interventions. This finding suggests that school-based fri reporting by teachers at sentinel schools could be a more feasible and effective method for detecting transmission clusters during future pandemics or severe seasonal influenza epidemics when interventions such as school closures and targeted administration of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis are being considered.,PMC3544582,PMC3544582_2
"The study also found that not all presentations of acute respiratory illness, including self-reported febrile respiratory illness in children, were included in the serological surveys used for comparison in other countries following a single epidemic wave. This finding highlights the need for more comprehensive and representative serological surveys to accurately estimate influenza incidence rates in future pandemics or severe seasonal influenza epidemics.",PMC3544582,PMC3544582_3
"The study also noted that the estimates of infection rates in the study were fairly similar to other serological surveys of corresponding age groups in other countries following a single epidemic wave. However, the study also highlighted the need for more comprehensive and representative serological surveys to accurately estimate influenza incidence rates in future pandemics or severe seasonal influenza epidemics, as the data used to adjust for the sensitivity of the hi assay was based on results from adults, and there was a lack of data specific to younger populations.",PMC3544582,PMC3544582_4
