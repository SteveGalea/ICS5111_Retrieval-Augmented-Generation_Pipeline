"In a study published in Nature Communications, researchers from the University of Hong Kong identified a new class of antibodies called VHHs, which have the potential to neutralize a broad range of Ebola virus strains. These antibodies can also prevent viral entry into cells and can be produced using simple and cost-effective methods.",PMC4873000,PMC4873000_0
"A team of researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, San Francisco, reported in the journal Science that they have developed a CRISPR-Cas9-based gene-editing system that can be used to cure genetic diseases. The system can target and correct specific mutations in cells, providing a potential cure for genetic diseases.",PMC4873000,PMC4873000_1
"A study published in the journal Cell Reports revealed that a compound called TPEN can prevent the spread of the Zika virus. The compound can also prevent the formation of the virus's protective coat, making it easier to develop a vaccine against the virus.",PMC4873000,PMC4873000_2
"Researchers from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, reported in the journal Cell that they have discovered a new class of immune cells called MAITs. These cells can recognize and eliminate a broad range of bacterial strains, providing a potential new therapy for bacterial infections.",PMC4873000,PMC4873000_3
"A team of researchers from the University of Oxford, UK, and the University of California, Los Angeles, reported in the journal Nature that they have developed a new CRISPR-Cas9-based gene-editing system that can be used to target and correct specific mutations in cells. The system can also be used to selectively remove specific mutations, providing a potential new therapy for genetic diseases.",PMC4873000,PMC4873000_4
