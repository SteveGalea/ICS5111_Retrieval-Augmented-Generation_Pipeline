"Treatment of cotton rats with poly ICLC, a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA, causes an influenza-like illness characterized by increased pulmonary inflammation.",PMC2882628,PMC2882628_0
"The ifn response to infection, both type I and II, plays a dual role in viral pathogenesis, initiating an antiviral state in the lung but also promoting a tightly regulated proinflammatory state.",PMC2882628,PMC2882628_1
"The particulars of toll-like receptor (TLR) expression changes in treated cotton rats, such as up-regulation of TLR1, 2, and 3 mRNA and down-regulation of TLR5 mRNA, strikingly resemble changes induced by influenza infection and IFN stimulation of human macrophages and epithelial cells.",PMC2882628,PMC2882628_2
"Poly ICLC-induced changes in lung TLR expression likely reflect inducible mRNA expression in respiratory epithelial and resident inflammatory cells, as well as an increase in pulmonary cellular infiltrate (neutrophils, like macrophages, express a wide range of TLR molecules).",PMC2882628,PMC2882628_3
"Increased expression of chemokines regulating neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage recruitment and activation in RSV-infected, poly ICLC-treated animals leads to a significant increase in neutrophil and macrophage presence in the airways of RSV-infected animals after poly ICLC treatment, contributing to increased neutrophil presence in the airways of RSV-infected animals after poly ICLC treatment and overall increase in pulmonary pathology of RSV infection.",PMC2882628,PMC2882628_4
