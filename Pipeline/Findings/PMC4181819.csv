"In a retrospective study of 191 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, preceding respiratory viruses were detected in 25% (48/191) of patients within the 30 days preceding pneumonia presentation. Hypoalbuminemia, azotemia, and male sex were identified as risk factors associated with severe pneumococcal pneumonia.",PMC4181819,PMC4181819_0
"The study found that preceding respiratory viruses were one of the independent risk factors associated with severe pneumococcal pneumonia, suggesting a potential role of preceding respiratory viruses on clinical severity.",PMC4181819,PMC4181819_1
The study also found that preceding respiratory viruses were not significantly associated with severe pneumococcal pneumonia in patients with other forms of bacterial pneumonia.,PMC4181819,PMC4181819_2
The study highlights the need for further studies to understand the role of preceding respiratory viruses and to determine the clinical benefits of routine viral diagnostic tests for respiratory viruses in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia.,PMC4181819,PMC4181819_3
The study notes that screening and early detection of respiratory viruses in patients with severe pneumococcal pneumonia might be warranted for appropriate antiviral therapy and the prevention of intra-hospital transmission.,PMC4181819,PMC4181819_4
