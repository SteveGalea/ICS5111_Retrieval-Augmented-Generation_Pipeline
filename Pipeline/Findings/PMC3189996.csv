"The study found that all known filovirus glycoproteins, including those from Ebola and Marburg viruses, can counteract the antiviral protein tetherin, indicating biological relevance for tetherin antagonism in primates.",PMC3189996,PMC3189996_0
"The study showed that the ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) can block tetherin's antiviral activity by relocating it to intracellular compartments, whereas the GP of the marburg virus, like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) GP, can counteract tetherin by reducing its expression.",PMC3189996,PMC3189996_1
"The study found that the ebola virus GP, like the HIV GP and the marburg virus GP, can interfere with tetherin surface expression, but its ability to counteract tetherin does not depend on the downregulation of tetherin expression, as previously reported for the HIV GP and the marburg virus GP.",PMC3189996,PMC3189996_2
"The study found that the extent of tetherin glycosylation depends on the source of cellular tetherin, with substantial size differences in tetherin between cells expressing tetherin induced by interferon (IFN) and cells expressing endogenous tetherin.",PMC3189996,PMC3189996_3
"The study found that the ability of the ebola virus GP to counteract tetherin is cell type-dependent and that the extent of tetherin glycosylation is also cell type-dependent, but the determinants underlying these findings are at present unclear.",PMC3189996,PMC3189996_4
