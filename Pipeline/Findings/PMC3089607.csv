"The study found that both ciliated cells (β-tubulin+) and non-ciliated cells (k14+) in chicken trachea express saα2–3gal-capped oligosaccharides, which are recognized by maa lectin.",PMC3089607,PMC3089607_0
The study found that the expression intensity of saα2–3gal in ciliated cells is higher than that in non-ciliated cells.,PMC3089607,PMC3089607_1
The study found that saα2–3gal-capped oligosaccharides in chicken tracheal basal cells are preferentially recognized by sna lectin.,PMC3089607,PMC3089607_2
"The study found that both saα2–3gal and saα2–6gal-capped oligosaccharides are expressed in chicken tracheal basal cells, but the expression levels of saα2–6gal are lower than those of saα2–3gal.",PMC3089607,PMC3089607_3
"The study found that the chicken influenza virus strain A/Taiwan/2838/H12/04, which causes acute respiratory disease in chickens, binds to saα2–3gal-capped oligosaccharides through the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. However, the specificity of the HA protein for determining receptor tropism of the virus is determined by several critical residues in HA, and the study did not determine the specificity of HA protein for saα2–3gal-capped oligosaccharides in chicken tracheal epithelial cells.",PMC3089607,PMC3089607_4
