"This study demonstrates that fmdv, a non-enveloped virus that previously was thought to be unable to activate professional antigen-presenting cells (pDC), can indeed activate pDC, but only in the presence of specific antibodies against the virus.",PMC3479418,PMC3479418_0
The study shows that both immune-complexed fmdv and uncomplexed fmdv can activate pDC via the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) pathway.,PMC3479418,PMC3479418_1
"The study reveals that some fmdv isolates are consistently better at inducing pDC to produce interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) than others, and this difference is not related to a cell culture adaptation of certain fmdv isolates to heparin-sulphate binding.",PMC3479418,PMC3479418_2
"The study suggests that the type of antibodies and their specificities is similar for both opsonization and neutralization, as opsonization can occur with serum dilutions similar to those required for neutralization, when antigenically related viruses from the same serotypes are employed.",PMC3479418,PMC3479418_3
"The study highlights that non-neutralizing vaccine-induced antibodies could enhance innate immune responses against antigenically less related fmdv challenge strains and restrict their ability to replicate, potentially limiting virus replication, the severity of clinical diseases, and transmission within the heard.",PMC3479418,PMC3479418_4
