"The study identified specific cell types targeted by both sdav following intratracheal inoculation of rats and by sars-cov infection of humans. These included bronchial epithelial cells, type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages.",PMC2887555,PMC2887555_0
"The study demonstrated that sdav infection in rats primarily infected epithelial cells, with alveolar type I and II cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells being infected. Alveolar macrophages were not infected.",PMC2887555,PMC2887555_1
"The study identified cells of the human respiratory tract that are infected by both sdav following intratracheal inoculation of rats and by sars-cov infection of humans. These included type II cells and type I-like cells, as well as bronchial epithelial cells.",PMC2887555,PMC2887555_2
"The study found that infection of alveolar type I and II cells in the lung led to increased levels of chemokines lix and mcp-1, which are chemotactic for neutrophils and macrophages.",PMC2887555,PMC2887555_3
"The study identified specific respiratory viral infections, including sdav and sars-cov, and their effects on the respiratory tract. The study also noted that good animal models for analysis of the innate immune response to epithelial cell infection in a/j mice, such as mhv-1 strain of murine cov, are not available for the other four human covs, and that the rat model can provide a platform for antiviral drug studies.",PMC2887555,PMC2887555_4
