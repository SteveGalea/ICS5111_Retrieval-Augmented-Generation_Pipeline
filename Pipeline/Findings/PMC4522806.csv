"The structures of the nsp14-nsp10 complex and its mutants reveal several important findings. First, both zinc fingers of nsp14 are located remote from the active sites in the complex, suggesting that they have structural roles rather than catalytic functions. Second, the nsp14-nsp10 complex adopts an atypical mtase fold, indicating a unique mechanism underlying the involvement of nsp14 in viral replication and transcription. Third, two zinc fingers are located on the exon domain of nsp14, suggesting their potential roles in nsp14's exon function. Fourth, the complex harbors a highly constricted cavity that binds both substrates and ligands, suggesting a potential role for nsp14 in viral replication and transcription.",PMC4522806,PMC4522806_0
"The structures of the nsp14-nsp10 complex and its mutants provide evidence for the following important findings. First, the nsp14-nsp10 complex and its mutants have highly similar structures, suggesting that the complex is essential for the functions of nsp14 in viral replication and transcription. Second, mutations in the exon domain of nsp14 affect its structure and function, suggesting that this domain is critical for nsp14's exon function. Third, mutations in the mtase domain of nsp14 affect its structure and function, suggesting that this domain is critical for nsp14's methyltransferase function. Fourth, the complex has a highly constricted cavity that binds both substrates and ligands, suggesting a potential role for nsp14 in viral replication and transcription.",PMC4522806,PMC4522806_1
