"The study identified seven bat samples positive for paramyxovirus, including three insectivorous bats (hipposideros cineraceus, h. armiger, and taphozous melanopogon) and two frugivorous bats (eonycteris spelaea and rousettus leschenaultii) in China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that viruses carried by insectivorous bats could not be definitely assigned to any existing paramyxovirus genus, but clustered within the relatively new genus of Jeilongvirus, which has been identified in bats in China.",PMC4036550,PMC4036550_0
"The study found that virus sequences from bat samples were unable to be assembled from the clean reads, which is similar to previous studies, and may be due to the low quantity of the virus within samples, the short reads, and the lack of known reference sequences.",PMC4036550,PMC4036550_1
"The study detected full-length viral genomic sequences for the first time in bat samples, which were unable to be assembled from the clean reads. This result is similar to that of previous studies and may be due to the low quantity of the virus within samples, the short reads, and the lack of known reference sequences.",PMC4036550,PMC4036550_2
"The study found that many viral contigs showed equivalent or higher identity with fowlpox virus (FPV), more than reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV). FPV is a prototypical member of avipoxvirus, which only infects non-mammalian hosts, and there is no previous data available to indicate that bats are natural reservoirs or vectors of FPV.",PMC4036550,PMC4036550_3
"The study found that the majority of the viral sequences found in bats were distinct from those previously identified in bats and were often diverse within the viral family. The novel viruses identified were classified into two viral families, retroviridae and polyomaviridae, which were also detected in previous studies. The limited size or number of contigs generated by illumina sequencing may necessitate follow-up with conventional PCR assays in order to obtain enough sequence to perform meaningful phylogenetic analyses.",PMC4036550,PMC4036550_4
