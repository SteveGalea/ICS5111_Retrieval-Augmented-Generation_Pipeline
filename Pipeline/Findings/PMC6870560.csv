"The study found that ibv is widely circulating in Poland, with 793b being the most frequently detected strain (382 out of 482 sequences; 79.3%).",PMC6870560,PMC6870560_0
"The study also revealed that the majority (82.8%) of ibv positive samples had a vaccine origin, either being classified as vaccine strains or vaccine-derived strains.",PMC6870560,PMC6870560_1
"The study identified the lineages 793b, variant 2, and qx as field strains, with variant 2 being the most clinically relevant lineage in Poland, as it has been associated with severe economic losses and respiratory and renal symptoms.",PMC6870560,PMC6870560_2
"The study highlighted the persistence of vaccine-derived strains, with 36.5% of ibv detections being vaccine-derived strains, and suggested that live vaccines can spread and persist, even in farms where they are not adopted.",PMC6870560,PMC6870560_3
"The study also revealed that 89.3% of the detected vaccine-derived strains were 4/91-like, with a higher spreading capability of the 4/91 vaccine compared to the 1/96-based one, as opposed to none and 6.4% of the 1/96 and cr88 detections, respectively.",PMC6870560,PMC6870560_4
