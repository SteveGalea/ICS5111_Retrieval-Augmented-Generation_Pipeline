"The presence of ms2t6a37 in the anticodon loop stabilizes the conformation of the anticodon bases, leading to a highly ordered stair-stepped conformation that is important for codon recognition. This is observed in simulations and is consistent with previous studies that found a closed small subunit around the trna in the e.coli 30s ribosomal subunit, where the ureido ring allows greater stacking interactions with a38.",PMC1636460,PMC1636460_0
"The presence of ms2t6a37 in the anticodon loop also stabilizes the position of a37 through hydrogen bond contacts across the loop, preventing the displacement of u36. This is observed in simulations where the bulk of the t6a substituent's hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are solvent exposed, leading to markedly increased conformational freedom for u36.",PMC1636460,PMC1636460_1
"The presence of ms2t6a37 in the anticodon loop encourages retention of a highly ordered stair-stepped conformation for codon recognition, and base modifications at position 37 seem to stabilize u36 participation in the stair-stepped conformation. This is observed in simulations where the negative electron densities of the aromatic bases may repel each other and electrostatic interactions, in which positive portions of the base above are interacting with the negative electron density of the base below, may predominate.",PMC1636460,PMC1636460_2
"The role of modified bases in stablizing codon–anticodon complexes seems to be base and system dependent. This is observed in simulations where the negative electron densities of the aromatic bases may repel each other and electrostatic interactions, in which positive portions of the base above are interacting with the negative electron density of the base below, may predominate.",PMC1636460,PMC1636460_3
"The crystal structure of yeast trnaphe, which contains a ψ55, has a water molecule bridging the n1-h position to the neighboring phosphate oxygens of t54 and ψ55, which is believed to restrict ψ motion and stabilize a–ψ base pairs. This is observed in simulations where a long-lived water molecule coordinated to ψ has been found in trnaasp through mds simulations, where this water-mediated hydrogen bond with",PMC1636460,PMC1636460_4
