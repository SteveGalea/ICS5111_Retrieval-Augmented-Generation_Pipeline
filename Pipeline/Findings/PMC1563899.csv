"The authors demonstrate that the viral protein s from SARS-CoV induces ER stress and selectively modulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) by activating the PERK branch and sparing the IRE1/XBP1 branches, allowing for enhanced expression of ER chaperones and viral proteins (fig. 1, 2, and 4).",PMC1563899,PMC1563899_0
The authors suggest that the low level of XBP1 splicing in SARS-CoV-infected cells is due to an as-yet-unknown mechanism independent of the s protein (fig. 5b).,PMC1563899,PMC1563899_1
The authors reveal that infection with SARS-CoV does not induce apoptosis in some cells or at an early stage of infection (25).,PMC1563899,PMC1563899_2
"The authors suggest that the disruption of calcium homeostasis by ER stress and the UPR is a feature of viral enterotoxin exemplified by rotavirus NSP4, and it remains to be seen whether SARS-CoV proteins can sufficiently induce calcium release from ER and cause diarrhea by acting as an NSP4-like viral enterotoxin (introduction and fig. 2).",PMC1563899,PMC1563899_3
"The authors suggest that the modulation of ER stress and the UPR by SARS-CoV reveals a novel opportunity for pharmaceutical intervention of SARS, as due to the importance of ER stress in various human diseases, including viral infection, selective inhibitors of eIF2Î± dephosphorylation and drugs that modulate ER stress have been under intense investigation (discussion and introduction).",PMC1563899,PMC1563899_4
