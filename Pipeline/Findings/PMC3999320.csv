"Comparison of the ica kit with other detection methods: The prevalence rates of rotaviruses and adenoviruses detected by the ica kit were comparable to those reported in previous studies. The overall agreement rates among the four methods were 91.5% for rotaviruses and 85.5% for adenoviruses. The discordant results observed among the different assays could be explained by differences in the ability of each assay to detect variable viral burdens in stool samples. However, the possibility of false-positive findings and different detectability for adenovirus subtypes among different adenovirus detection methods should be considered.",PMC3999320,PMC3999320_0
"Cross-reactivity and analytical reactivity: No cross-reactivity was observed for any of the 36 viruses, 30 bacteria, and two fungi tested. The ica kit could detect every adenovirus type tested, whereas the Seeplex DV assay (mrt-pcr) could detect only Adv40 and 41. The different results observed among the different assays could be because the antibodies used in the ica and ELISA reagents could detect all types of adenovirus capsid antigens, whereas specific adenovirus types could be detected by using PCR according to the primers used.",PMC3999320,PMC3999320_1
"Repeatability and limit of detection: The repeatability and reproducibility of the ica kit for rotaviruses and adenoviruses were 100%. The discordant rate between the ica kit and MRT-PCR was similar to that reported in previous studies (2.1-4.3%). The ica kit could detect rotavirus and adenovirus in diluted culture supernatants at a dilution of 1:16 for rotavirus and 1:64 for adenovirus, whereas real-time PCR and MRT-PCR could detect at a dilution of 1:1024. However, similar to the rotavirus results, 15 stool samples were positive for adenovirus when tested by using the ica kit, but negative when tested by using ELISA, real-time PCR, and MRT-PCR. This finding also suggests a high probability of false-positive findings",PMC3999320,PMC3999320_2
