"The study found that mice housed in intracage ventilation (ICV) systems had significantly higher rates of water consumption, urine osmolality, and insensible water loss through the skin (tewl) compared to mice housed in static (closed-top) cages. This difference was seen in all strains of mice studied, including scid, skh, fvb, and c57 mice.",PMC5029822,PMC5029822_0
"The study also found that hairless c57 mice housed in ICV systems had significantly higher rates of insensible water loss through the skin compared to mice housed in static cages. This finding suggests that the epidermis of these mice may not be able to compensate for depilation, increasing the risk for dehydration in mice already compromised due to experimental manipulation.",PMC5029822,PMC5029822_1
"The study found that c57 mice, which is a primary mouse strain used in biomedical research, had significantly higher rates of insensible water loss through the skin compared to mice housed in static cages. This finding is important, as it indicates that the increased insensible water loss in c57 mice housed in ICV systems is a strain-specific difference that should be considered in studies involving renal function or water restriction.",PMC5029822,PMC5029822_2
"The study found that mice housed in ICV systems had significantly higher rates of water consumption and urine osmolality compared to mice housed in static cages, regardless of mouse sex or strain.",PMC5029822,PMC5029822_3
"The study found that mice housed in ICV systems had significantly higher rates of insensible water loss through the skin compared to mice housed in static cages, regardless of mouse sex or strain. However, further investigation is needed to determine whether the increased insensible water loss in c57 mice housed in ICV systems is a result of altered vitamin A metabolism, excessive grooming, or the robust T-helper immune response of this strain, as these factors have been associated with subacute changes in the dermis of these mice.",PMC5029822,PMC5029822_4
