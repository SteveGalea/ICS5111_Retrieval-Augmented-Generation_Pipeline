"Zebov-specific monoclonal antibody jp3k11, which targets a linear epitope in the N-terminal region of gp1, is glycoprotein-specific and neutralizing, as shown by flow cytometry immunostaining procedures and live 293 cell infection assays.",PMC3351102,PMC3351102_0
"Pseudovirus construction and neutralization assays using zebov-mayinga 1976-derived plasmid vectors, which encode gp from zebov-mayinga 1976 (genbank accession #u23187), reveal that cathepsin L-cleaved gp-pseudovirus is less infectious than wt gp-pseudovirus, indicating that cathepsin L-mediated cleavage of gp1 is an important step in viral entry.",PMC3351102,PMC3351102_1
"Live 293 cells infected with cathepsin L-cleaved gp-pseudovirus, as well as gp mutants expressed on cells, demonstrate that antibody-binding is significantly reduced compared to wt gp-pseudovirus and δ49–277 protein, which is mainly secreted and affects covalent association between gp1 and gp2.",PMC3351102,PMC3351102_2
"The competitive immunoprecipitation assay using cathepsin L-treated gp-pseudovirus, as well as the entry assay using gp-pseudovirus following incubation in the presence or absence of cathepsin L, reveal that cathepsin L-mediated cleavage of gp1 is an important step in viral entry, and that antibody-binding is significantly reduced in the presence of cathepsin L-cleaved gp-pseudovirus compared to wt gp-pseudovirus.",PMC3351102,PMC3351102_3
