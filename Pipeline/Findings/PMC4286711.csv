"The study reports the development of an efficient transient tobacco expression system for human cytomegalovirus (hcv) core protein (hcvcp) in the iranian jafarabadi tobacco cultivar, which has not been previously reported.",PMC4286711,PMC4286711_0
"The study's optimization approach for hcvcp in tobacco includes codon optimization, removal of destabilizing ggtaag sequences, and inclusion of kozak and kdel sequences for highest possible expression efficiency.",PMC4286711,PMC4286711_1
"The study's results indicate that the pvx-based viral replicative vector provides higher expression levels of hcvcp compared to the classic, nonreplicative, binary vector.",PMC4286711,PMC4286711_2
"The study's results also demonstrate the proper structure of the plant-produced hcvcp to be used as a vaccine candidate, as it carries two important immunological epitopes conserved between hcv strains: 1a, 1b, and 2, and 35-44 amino acids are hcv-specific hla-a2-restricted ctl epitopes.",PMC4286711,PMC4286711_3
"The study's preliminary results show that plant-hcvcp has the capability to capture anti-hcvcp antibodies for potential clinical applications, which should be further evaluated and confirmed through standardization of phcvcp for application in diagnostic elisa and immunization studies.",PMC4286711,PMC4286711_4
