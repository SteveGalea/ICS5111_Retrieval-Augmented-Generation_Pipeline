"The study established a highly specific and sensitive conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for detecting porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) with a detection limit of 2 Ã— 101 copies molecule, which is equivalent to that of a sybr green-based real-time RT-PCR assay.",PMC6247729,PMC6247729_0
"The study validated the performance of the conventional RT-PCR assay using 84 clinical samples, demonstrating that it provides a cost-effective and highly sensitive method for PDCoV diagnosis.",PMC6247729,PMC6247729_1
"The study found that the sensitivity of the conventional RT-PCR assay could be significantly improved with selected primers, but modulation of reaction conditions had no effect on the performance of the assay.",PMC6247729,PMC6247729_2
"The study confirmed that the conventional RT-PCR assay had a higher sensitivity than a previously reported one-step RT-PCR assay, which would underestimate the prevalence of PDCoV infection in pig herds due to its low sensitivity.",PMC6247729,PMC6247729_3
"The study highlighted the importance of developing a rapid and accurate diagnosis method for PDCoV, given that low feed remuneration is observed in infected newborn piglets, and ultimately, infected animals need to be identified and segregated in a timely manner.",PMC6247729,PMC6247729_4
