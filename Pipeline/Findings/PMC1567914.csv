"The study identified three small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the 3a gene, designated as si-001, si-002, and si-003.",PMC1567914,PMC1567914_0
"The most effective siRNA for suppressing 3a expression was si-003 at different concentrations (100, 50, 25, and 12.5 nm).",PMC1567914,PMC1567914_1
"The study determined the expression of the 3a protein in oocytes using si-003, and the effects of siRNAs in suppressing 3a expression were evaluated in sars-cov-infected cells.",PMC1567914,PMC1567914_2
"The study also described the design of siRNAs targeting the 3a gene and the use of siRNAs for suppressing 3a expression in sars-cov-infected cells, as well as the determination of the effects of siRNAs in suppressing 3a expression by western blot assay.",PMC1567914,PMC1567914_3
"The study mentioned the use of a tcs sp2 confocal microscope and its analytical software for fret bleaching, as well as the use of a two-electrode voltage clamp for measuring the current flow at different defined membrane potentials.",PMC1567914,PMC1567914_4
