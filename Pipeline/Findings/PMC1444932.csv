"Lactococcus lactis, a food-grade lactic acid bacterium, has been engineered to produce and secrete bovine abortus GroEL, a heat-shock protein that is a well-known immunodominant target in brucellosis.",PMC1444932,PMC1444932_0
GroEL production and secretion by the engineered L. lactis strain have been achieved using plasmids that control its expression and target it to either the cytoplasm or the extracellular medium.,PMC1444932,PMC1444932_1
"Although groEL has low secretion efficiency, the engineered strain has potential for oral immunization trials due to groEL's immunogenicity and its ability to confer protection against challenge with B. abortus.",PMC1444932,PMC1444932_2
Dose-dependent protection against B. abortus challenge has been demonstrated in mice using a groEL-containing vaccine.,PMC1444932,PMC1444932_3
Further studies are being conducted to define the immune response and the level of protection conferred by the groEL-containing vaccine.,PMC1444932,PMC1444932_4
