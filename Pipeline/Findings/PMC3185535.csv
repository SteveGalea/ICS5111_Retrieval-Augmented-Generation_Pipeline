"This study found that the genetic type distribution of human rhinovirus (HRV) strains in sputum samples of adult military recruits mirrors the distribution of overall HRV diversity, with HRV-A strongly prevailing.",PMC3185535,PMC3185535_0
The study did not find any significant differences in HRV epidemiology between asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients.,PMC3185535,PMC3185535_1
"The study identified several suggestions to elucidate patterns of HRV epidemiology, including the prevalence of HRV-D in military conscripts and the association between HRV-C and respiratory symptoms.",PMC3185535,PMC3185535_2
"The study also found that the genetic type distribution of enterovirus (EV) strains, including coxsackie virus and EV-D6, in sputum samples of adult military recruits is similar to the overall EV distribution, with EV-D6 being the most prevalent.",PMC3185535,PMC3185535_3
"The study noted that the prevalence of HRV-B in military conscripts was lower compared to other HRV species, and suggested further research to determine the reasons for this.",PMC3185535,PMC3185535_4
