"This study identified a hospital-associated outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Daejeon, South Korea, affecting 14 patients, with a case fatality rate of 44%. The outbreak occurred in two hospitals and was associated with a single index case-patient in a hospital in Daejeon. The estimated median incubation period was similar to that observed in previous outbreaks in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia in 2013 and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2014.",PMC5443424,PMC5443424_0
"The attack rate among caregivers was higher in Hospital A than in Hospital B, as caregivers in Hospital A, who cared for mostly bedridden immobile patients, were required to be in prolonged close contact with patients, increasing the probability of MERS-CoV transmission. In Hospital B, the attack rate among caregivers was lower, possibly due to the presence of more severely ill patients.",PMC5443424,PMC5443424_1
"The authors identified several cases with uncommon routes of transmission, such as a nurse in the intensive care unit who performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation while wearing a level D protector, potentially exposing herself to MERS-CoV, and an employee who worked in information technology and was employed by Hospital A during Januaryâ€“May 30, 2015, potentially infected by fomites in an elevator or exposed to a patient in a place lacking closed-circuit television coverage.",PMC5443424,PMC5443424_2
"The authors developed a unique and successful cohort quarantine policy to prevent the spread of MERS-CoV to the local community. However, the policy raised ethical issues associated with close contact of susceptible persons with potentially infected persons, as some medical staff and caregivers may have been contaminated with MERS-CoV after visiting Room 1007, potentially exposing them to a patient in Room 1013.",PMC5443424,PMC5443424_3
"The authors noted that the characteristics of specific hospitals affected attack rates and case fatality rates. Hospital B, which is a university hospital and contains more severely ill patients than Hospital A, had a higher case fatality rate than Hospital A. Additionally, because immobile patients require personal caregiving, their caregivers were required to be in prolonged close contact with patients, increasing the probability of MERS-CoV transmission.",PMC5443424,PMC5443424_4
