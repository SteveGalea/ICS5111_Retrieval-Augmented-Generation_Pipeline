"The study demonstrated that pervs, which are retroviruses capable of infecting humans, exist not only in pig tissues but also actively replicate in them.",PMC4615419,PMC4615419_0
"The rt activity, which is a highly sensitive and specific marker for all perv types, was detected in the sera, muscle cell-free supernatants, and liver cell-free supernatants of both Chinese experimental mini-pigs and domestic pig breeds.",PMC4615419,PMC4615419_1
"The rt activities from the four domestic pig breeds were higher than that of the Chinese experimental mini-pigs in both the muscle cell-free supernatants and liver cell-free supernatants, indicating that pervs exist not only in Chinese experimental mini-pigs but also actively replicate in them.",PMC4615419,PMC4615419_2
"The study did not find any evidence of infection with pervs in the patients' sera soon after treatment or within 1 month of follow-up, despite the fact that the human immune system can clear perv particles effectively through various specific and non-specific mechanisms.",PMC4615419,PMC4615419_3
"The ability to monitor clinical trials closely using these assays will be of great benefit to the microbiological safety of clinical blass and xenotransplantation, as it allows for the close monitoring of clinical blass and xenotransplantation trials and sets a possible standard for laboratory surveillance of perv infection after exposure to cellular xenografts from pigs.",PMC4615419,PMC4615419_4
