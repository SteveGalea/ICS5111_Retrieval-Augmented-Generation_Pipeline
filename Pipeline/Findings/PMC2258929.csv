"The study found that infection by momlv pseudovirions bearing jsrv env was strongly inhibited by bafilav, suggesting that jsrv entry is ph dependent.",PMC2258929,PMC2258929_0
"Nh4cl and chloroquine had less effect on jsrv pseudovirion infection than on classical ph-dependent viruses, possibly due to stable virus-cell complexes in endocytic vesicles.",PMC2258929,PMC2258929_1
"Low ph conditionally overcomes a bafilav block on jsrv infection, but rescue of bafilav block requires preincubation of virus-bound cells.",PMC2258929,PMC2258929_2
"Dynamin is required for jsrv entry, indicating that a dynamin-dependent, caveola-mediated endocytosis pathway is involved in jsrv entry.",PMC2258929,PMC2258929_3
"Low ph does not readily inactivate jsrv pseudovirions, suggesting that additional events besides low ph are involved in jsrv fusion and entry, possibly a two-step fusion mechanism similar to that of aslv.",PMC2258929,PMC2258929_4
