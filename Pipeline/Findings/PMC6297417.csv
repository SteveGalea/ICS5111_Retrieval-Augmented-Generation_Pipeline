"In a study of 1,332 patients with influenza pneumonia, m. Pneumoniae coinfection was associated with the age of 5-10 years and clinically indistinguishable from influenza pneumonia without the coinfection.",PMC6297417,PMC6297417_0
Low wbc count and crp concentration in influenza pneumonia may hinder distinguishing between influenza pneumonia with and without the coinfection.,PMC6297417,PMC6297417_1
"M. Pneumoniae testing should be performed to optimize antibiotic therapy in the setting of the coinfection, as macrolides were given more frequently to patients with the coinfection without a delay.",PMC6297417,PMC6297417_2
"Prompt m. Pneumoniae testing could contribute to early detection of the coinfection in influenza pneumonia, especially in patients aged 5-10 years who are at relatively low risk for influenza pneumonia.",PMC6297417,PMC6297417_3
"The current guidelines for pediatric cap, which recommend macrolides as empirical antibiotics only in cases of presumed atypical pneumonia, can lead to omission of macrolide therapy in patients with the coinfection.",PMC6297417,PMC6297417_4
