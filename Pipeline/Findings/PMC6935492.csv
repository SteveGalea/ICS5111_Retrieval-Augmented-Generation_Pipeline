"Over 1000 previously uncharacterized microbial species have been reconstructed from nhp metagenomic cohorts, expanding the known microbial diversity associated with nhps by 600%.",PMC6935492,PMC6935492_0
"Comparative analysis reveals that only 20% of microbial candidate species in nhps are also found in the human microbiome, with a higher overlap between nhps and non-westernized populations and those living in captivity.",PMC6935492,PMC6935492_1
Phylogenetic analysis suggests that host lifestyle plays a role comparable to host speciation in shaping the primate intestinal microbiome.,PMC6935492,PMC6935492_2
"Several nhp-specific species are phylogenetically related to human-associated microbes, indicating potentially host-dependent evolutionary trajectories.",PMC6935492,PMC6935492_3
"The newly reconstructed species greatly expand the potential for better interrogation of the primate microbiome, enabling in-depth human and non-human comparative and co-diversification studies.",PMC6935492,PMC6935492_4
