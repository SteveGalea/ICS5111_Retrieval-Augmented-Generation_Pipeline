"The etiology and pathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) remain largely unknown, and while recurrence of the disease following liver transplantation is observed in up to one-third of patients, the factors modulating disease recurrence are poorly understood.",PMC3640509,PMC3640509_0
"Little is known about the etiology and pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in the non-transplant setting, and while three diverse processes could be involved, including autoimmunity, a forme fruste of allograft rejection, and the possibility of a viral infection, the seroprevalence of human betaretrovirus (HBRV) infection in patients with AIH has been reported, and the observation that the use of corticosteroids may have a dual purpose of limiting viral spread and diminishing inflammation has been proposed.",PMC3640509,PMC3640509_1
"While more than two-thirds of patients with PBC develop both a mitochondrial phenotype in bile ducts and autoantibodies against mitochondrial antigens (MA), only one-third of patients develop biochemical and histological disease recurrence 10 years following transplantation.",PMC3640509,PMC3640509_2
"The use of cyclosporine A (CSA) and analogues, such as NIM811, can inhibit betaretrovirus production, and this observation supports the hypothesis that a betaretrovirus may trigger viral cholangitis in susceptible individuals with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR and DQ class II alleles and genetic polymorphisms associated with the interleukin-12 (IL-12) cytokine axis.",PMC3640509,PMC3640509_3
"While data demonstrating proviral integration in patients with liver disease to provide more substantial evidence that HBRV is a potential human pathogen are lacking, an elisa is being constructed to determine the seroprevalence of HBRV infection in a large cohort of patients with liver disease, and mouse models are being used to demonstrate how infection with the closely related mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) triggers autoimmune biliary disease.",PMC3640509,PMC3640509_4
