"In the study on the minimal infectious dose of niv and the efficacy of m102.4 in preventing lethal niv infection in ferrets, a significant correlation was found between the levels of m102.4 antibodies and protection from niv infection. Ferrets with higher levels of m102.4 antibodies at 24 hours and 10 days post-challenge were found to have lower niv titers, indicating that m102.4 can provide effective protection against niv infection.",PMC2765826,PMC2765826_0
"The study also revealed that niv infection in ferrets results in severe disease, characterized by high fever, severe respiratory distress, and weight loss. The animals exhibited symptoms such as depression, lethargy, anorexia, and severe respiratory distress, and many of them died within 21 days post-infection.",PMC2765826,PMC2765826_1
The study showed that ferrets inoculated with niv at a low dose of 5×104 tcd50 had a higher incidence of severe disease and weight loss than those inoculated with niv at a higher dose of 5×103 tcd50. This suggests that the dose of virus inoculated plays a critical role in determining the severity of the disease caused by niv infection.,PMC2765826,PMC2765826_2
The study also revealed that m102.4 administration at 10 hours post-challenge resulted in lower niv titers compared to those in ferrets that did not receive m102.4 administration. This suggests that m102.4 administration can be an effective strategy to prevent niv infection and mitigate the severity of the disease caused by niv infection.,PMC2765826,PMC2765826_3
"The study found that ferrets with higher levels of m102.4 antibodies at 24 hours post-challenge and 10 days post-challenge had lower niv titers, suggesting that m102.4 antibodies play a critical role in preventing niv infection and mitigating the severity of the disease caused by niv infection. This finding has important implications for the development of effective vaccines against henipavirus infection.",PMC2765826,PMC2765826_4
