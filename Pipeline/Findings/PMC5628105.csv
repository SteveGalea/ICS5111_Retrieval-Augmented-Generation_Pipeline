"Niclosamide, a drug approved for treating parasitic infections, has shown preclinical activity in multiple disease models beyond its approved medical use, including cancer, metabolic diseases, and multiple types of infections.",PMC5628105,PMC5628105_0
"Niclosamide has demonstrated beneficial effects in disease models related to cancer, such as colon and prostate cancer, and has shown activity against viruses, bacteria, and fungi.",PMC5628105,PMC5628105_1
"Niclosamide has also demonstrated beneficial effects in models of systemic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, artery constriction, endometriosis, neuro-pathic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, graft-versus-host disease, and systemic sclerosis.",PMC5628105,PMC5628105_2
Niclosamide has pleotropic biological activities and has the potential to interact with multiple biological targets due to its ability to affect signaling pathways and its structural features associated with pleotropic pharmacologic activity.,PMC5628105,PMC5628105_3
"The pharmacokinetic properties of niclosamide need improvement through re-formulation or pro-drug strategies to make more widespread use of this drug, as well as the development of novel niclosamide derivatives that are biased toward targeting specific signaling pathways or biological functions in specific systemic diseases.",PMC5628105,PMC5628105_4
