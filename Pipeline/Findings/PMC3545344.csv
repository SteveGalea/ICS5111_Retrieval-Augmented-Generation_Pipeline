"At pet markets, direct and indirect contact with animals and related surfaces are widespread and pose a significant and major public health concern, as all animals, their containers, seller facilities, and sellers themselves are considered sources of potential contamination.",PMC3545344,PMC3545344_0
"The majority of observed visitors to vendors make indirect contact with animals through touching housing, tables, sellers, money, and other merchandise associated with vendors or animals.",PMC3545344,PMC3545344_1
"The proportion of visitors to vendors making subsequent modes of contact, such as hand to head (hand to mouth), hand to body (hand to body), and hand to another person, is broadly consistent between pet markets.",PMC3545344,PMC3545344_2
Person-to-person contamination is likely to rapidly increase its representation as presumed contaminated attendees move around the venue and readily form incidental contacts with a large number of people.,PMC3545344,PMC3545344_3
"The established nature of amphibians and reptiles as a reservoir of potentially pathogenic zoonotic agents implies that all animals, their containers, seller facilities, and sellers themselves must be regarded as sources of potential contamination.",PMC3545344,PMC3545344_4
"Hand sanitizer products used do not offer comprehensive protection from infection, and their promotion may encourage misplaced public confidence in an unreliable method.",PMC3545344,PMC3545344_5
"Contamination of clothes and hair represents a robust contamination source that persists even after leaving the pet market, regardless of hand cleansing.",PMC3545344,PMC3545344_6
"Hand sanitizer products used were infrequently adopted at the visited events, and when present, were utilized in a less than thorough manner.",PMC3545344,PMC3545344_7
"The situating of pet markets in venues often used for general public purposes, such as school halls and leisure centres, constitutes a potential public health hazard that realistically may endure for days, weeks, or months following the conclusion of the pet market.",PMC3545344,PMC3545344_8
"The persistence of bacterial contamination on surfaces in the general environment, including door handles, floors, doorways, walls, light switches, and many others, constitutes a potential ongoing public health hazard.",PMC3545344,PMC3545344_9
"Even non-attendance at a pet market does not guarantee that public health is not compromised, as these same venues may be sequentially used for a wide variety of other public purposes, including schooling of children, carrying with them a host of pathogens and the potential to spread disease far beyond the source",PMC3545344,PMC3545344_10
