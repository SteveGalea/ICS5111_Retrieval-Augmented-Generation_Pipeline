"The study identified a number of environmental exposures, including infections, medications, immunizations, stressful life events, and sun exposure, that occurred within 6 months before illness onset in children with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM).",PMC2981509,PMC2981509_0
"The study found that JDM patients had a higher frequency of documented exposures, including infectious illnesses and medications, compared to healthy controls.",PMC2981509,PMC2981509_1
"The study suggested that JDM may be polyenvironmental, as almost 40% of the patients had two or more reported exposures before illness onset, rather than a single documented exposure.",PMC2981509,PMC2981509_2
"The study noted that certain exposures, such as emotional stress and heavy weight lifting, could have occurred after the onset of illness as a consequence of the first unrecognized symptoms of disease, such as fatigue or muscle weakness.",PMC2981509,PMC2981509_3
"The study suggested that further investigation is needed to confirm the observations from this and other previous reports, as the absence of a control group and potential under- or over-reporting of potential exposures could potentially lead to under- or over-reporting of environmental factors.",PMC2981509,PMC2981509_4
