"Over 1700 confirmed cases of MERS have been documented worldwide, with more than a third of them resulting in deaths. The highest number of cases has occurred in Saudi Arabia, but the recent export of MERS-CoV to South Korea shows the possibility of a pandemic.",PMC5693564,PMC5693564_0
"A qualitative meta-analysis of all laboratory-confirmed MERS cases worldwide revealed several healthcare-associated outbreaks, starting with a retrospectively identified hospital outbreak in Jordan, as well as international transmission in eight waves between 2012 and 2015.",PMC5693564,PMC5693564_1
"The spatiotemporal history of MERS cases, as documented epidemiologically, revealed multiple zoonotic introductions in endemic nations, with the distribution of sequences indicating interleaving of MERS-CoV sequences from camels among those isolated from humans.",PMC5693564,PMC5693564_2
"The study reported a summary of basic reproduction numbers (R0) for MERS-CoV in humans and camels, which can help identify factors associated with viral evolution and spread, as well as establish the efficacy of infection control measures.",PMC5693564,PMC5693564_3
"The results of the study, especially pertinent to countries without current MERS-CoV endemic, can help identify factors associated with viral evolution and spread, as well as establish the efficacy of infection control measures, since unfamiliarity makes these countries particularly susceptible to uncontrollable spread of the virus imported by travelers.",PMC5693564,PMC5693564_4
