"The first identified case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in the United States did not result in transmission to any of the 61 identified contacts, despite the fact that some contacts had face-to-face interactions and prolonged exposure to the case-patient.",PMC4480394,PMC4480394_0
"The absence of transmission to household and community contacts may be due to the case-patient's mild initial respiratory symptoms, self-isolation at home, and lack of need for caregiving assistance before hospital admission.",PMC4480394,PMC4480394_1
"The absence of transmission to healthcare personnel (HCP) contacts may be due to the lack of high-risk procedures, short duration of exposure, and the few HCP contacts with underlying medical conditions.",PMC4480394,PMC4480394_2
The accuracy of recalled time versus actual time spent with the case-patient may be less reliable for HCP contacts who see the patient regularly for short periods of time.,PMC4480394,PMC4480394_3
"The use of GPS-based tracer tags to monitor HCP interaction with the case-patient may not always result in accurate data because HCP may not have been wearing their assigned tag when entering the room, or may have stood close to but not in the room, causing the tracking system to record incorrectly.",PMC4480394,PMC4480394_4
