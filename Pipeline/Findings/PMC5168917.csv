A study evaluated the utility of margin-reflex distance (mrd) in choosing the appropriate surgical procedure for congenital blepharoptosis.,PMC5168917,PMC5168917_0
The study found a positive linear correlation between mrd and levator function (lf) at first examination.,PMC5168917,PMC5168917_1
The study determined a cutoff point of 0.5 mm for mrd to differentiate between appropriate surgical intervention based on lf.,PMC5168917,PMC5168917_2
"Patients with initial mrd less than 0.5 mm had better outcomes when frontalis suspension was used, while those with initial mrd greater than or equal to 0.5 mm had better outcomes when levator resection was used.",PMC5168917,PMC5168917_3
"The study found that mrd had a discriminative power in determining appropriate surgery selection, with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 86% at the cutoff point of 0.5 mm.",PMC5168917,PMC5168917_4
