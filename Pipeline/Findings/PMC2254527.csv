"The study identified four pathogenic regions in the spike protein of SARS-CoV that share sequence homology with human proteins, with region 3 (residues 893-941) showing the highest similarity to angrgm-52, a novel gene upregulated in human mesangial cells stimulated by angiotensin II.",PMC2254527,PMC2254527_0
"Peptides d07 and d08, representing region 3, were recognized by the sera of SARS patients, indicating their immunogenicity and potential to induce autoantibodies.",PMC2254527,PMC2254527_1
"The study found that the d10 peptide, representing residues 490-502 of the spike protein's S1 domain, shared sequence homology with bradykinin and was able to generate antibodies cross-reactive with bradykinin.",PMC2254527,PMC2254527_2
"D10 peptide also stimulated A549 cells to produce IL-8 and proliferate, similar to angiotensin II, suggesting that the region of d10 in the spike protein may be involved in the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV.",PMC2254527,PMC2254527_3
