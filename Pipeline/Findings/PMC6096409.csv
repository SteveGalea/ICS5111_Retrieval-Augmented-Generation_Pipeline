"LncRNAs generated by viruses, such as sfrna derived from West Nile virus, can prevent host cells from undergoing apoptosis and obstruct interferon production, contributing to viral persistence [58].",PMC6096409,PMC6096409_0
"The adenovirus-associated RNAs vai RNA and vaii RNA can inhibit protein kinase RNA-activated (pkr) activation and interfere with the activity of dicer, two key players in the rnai pathway, to impart resistance to the antiviral immune response [50], [51].",PMC6096409,PMC6096409_1
"LncRNAs, such as sfrna derived from West Nile virus, can prevent host cells from undergoing apoptosis by regulating the anti-apoptotic g1p protein, contributing to viral persistence [64].",PMC6096409,PMC6096409_2
"LncRNAs, such as neat1, can mediate nuclear retention, modification, and/or storage of pre-mRNA processing machinery, and generate small ncRNAs, such as trnAs and miRNAs, to enlarge their regulatory power [71], [73], [76].",PMC6096409,PMC6096409_3
"LncRNAs, such as hulc, can function as ""mirna sponges"" with diverse and far-reaching effects, such as preventing core transcription factors (TFs) from functioning in miRNA-mediated suppression and maintaining embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation by targeting and antagonizing miR-145, which is a repressor of the translation of the core TF mRNAs [77].",PMC6096409,PMC6096409_4
