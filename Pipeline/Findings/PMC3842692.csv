"In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial involving 101 adults with acute bronchitis, the study medication, cineole, showed a statistically significant effect in reducing cough frequency after 4 days of treatment compared to placebo.",PMC3842692,PMC3842692_0
"Cineole also demonstrated a statistically significant effect in reducing cough frequency after 4 days of treatment compared to placebo in patients with acute bronchitis, based on a mean duration since the occurrence of acute bronchitis symptoms of about 4 days.",PMC3842692,PMC3842692_1
"The study found that cineole is effective in treating acute bronchitis due to its proven pharmacodynamics and pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory and mucolytic effects.",PMC3842692,PMC3842692_2
"The study's findings are complementary to previous results showing anti-inflammatory and mucolytic effects of cineole in patients with rhinosinusitis, COPD, and asthma, as the shown anti-tussive effects are also based on amelioration of inflammation and mucociliary clearance in patients with acute bronchitis.",PMC3842692,PMC3842692_3
"The study highlights the importance of selecting an effective symptom-sum-score, as the number of coughing fits is the most relevant parameter for demonstrating the progress of disease, with other parameters having only minor influence on the results.",PMC3842692,PMC3842692_4
"The study's findings also have socio-economic relevance, as the disorder affects approximately 5% of adults annually, it belongs to the 10 most common illnesses among outpatients, and relief of coughing and coughing fits occurs without significant increase of costs in comparison to other treatment options.",PMC3842692,PMC3842692_5
