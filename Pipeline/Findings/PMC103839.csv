"The editing process in paramyxoviruses, such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), involves inserting guanines (Gs) into their messenger RNAs (mRNAs) through a mechanism called mRNA editing.",PMC103839,PMC103839_0
"The editing sites in RSV mRNAs are located in the P and M genes, which encode the viral polymerases and matrix proteins, respectively.",PMC103839,PMC103839_1
"The mRNA editing in RSV occurs through the insertion of multiple Gs at editing sites, leading to the production of multiple G-containing mRNA variants.",PMC103839,PMC103839_2
"The editing process in RSV mRNAs involves a specific cis-acting sequence, which is the 5'-AAC-A6G3-3' polyuridylic tract (PU) in the P gene and the 5'-UUUU-A6G3-3' polyuridylic tract (PU) in the M gene.",PMC103839,PMC103839_3
"The editing process in RSV mRNAs is regulated by specific cis-acting sequences, such as the UUUUAAC-A6G3-3' tract in the P gene, which leads to the insertion of one to six Gs at a specific site in the mRNA.",PMC103839,PMC103839_4
"The editing process in RSV mRNAs involves a specific transcription complex, which includes the viral polymerase (SE) and the nascent RNA.",PMC103839,PMC103839_5
"The editing process in RSV mRNAs is regulated by specific transcription complexes, such as the SE-associated factor (SAF), which interacts with the viral polymerase and the nascent RNA to promote mRNA editing.",PMC103839,PMC103839_6
"The editing process in RSV mRNAs is regulated by specific cis-acting sequences, such as the UUUUAAC-A6G3-3' tract in the P gene, which leads to the insertion of one to six Gs at a specific site in the mRNA.",PMC103839,PMC103839_7
