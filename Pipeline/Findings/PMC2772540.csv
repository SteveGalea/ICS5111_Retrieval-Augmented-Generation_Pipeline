The authors present a list of 48 antigens from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that are expressed during pulmonary infections and are potential candidates for diagnostics and vaccine development.,PMC2772540,PMC2772540_0
"The authors demonstrate the applicability of a novel method, using nappas, for rapidly and comprehensively testing full-length bacterial omps for their ability to induce a humoral immune response in infected individuals.",PMC2772540,PMC2772540_1
"The authors found responses to most of the previously known antigens, such as exotoxin A, flagellin, and porin F, as well as responses to a considerable list of new P. Aeruginosa antigens, including hypothetical proteins.",PMC2772540,PMC2772540_2
"The authors attribute the stronger response of CF patients to the duration of infection, as these patients undergo phases of relative clearance, promoted by antibiotic treatment, during which antibody titers to some Pseudomonas aeruginosa antigens decrease significantly.",PMC2772540,PMC2772540_3
"The authors suggest that a multivalent vaccine, using the 12 most frequently detected antigens here, plus several of the others, seems a likely solution, given the multiple strains of P. Aeruginosa and the variation in antigen presentation by the pathogen in different infection types.",PMC2772540,PMC2772540_4
