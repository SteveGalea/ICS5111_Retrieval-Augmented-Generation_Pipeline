"The authors estimate that around six mers-cov infected individuals will attend the 2014 hajj, based on their planning scenarios. However, as of October 2014, no mers-cov cases were reported among hajj attendees, and only three suspected cases were identified among foreign pilgrims returning to their home countries.",PMC4323406,PMC4323406_0
"The authors suggest that a major outbreak of mers-cov during the hajj is unlikely due to several factors, including the short generation time of mers-cov (around 10 days) and the low probability of secondary infections during the hajj. However, they also acknowledge that super spreading events and viral mutations could lead to significantly more cases than predicted.",PMC4323406,PMC4323406_1
"The authors recommend that careful surveillance and testing will be critical in preparing for and containing any potential mers-cov outbreaks during the hajj, as the type of scenario planning reported in this manuscript is essential to any public health response, and it is essential to continue updating and consulting planning scenarios, so that we are prepared to confront and contain the disease whatever may come.",PMC4323406,PMC4323406_2
"The authors suggest that most hajj pilgrims do not mix with locals or visit locations other than the hajj area, reducing their opportunities to be infected.",PMC4323406,PMC4323406_3
"The authors acknowledge that super spreading events where a single mers-cov infected animal or human causes a large number of cases are possible, and viral mutations that shorten the generation time or lead to more efficient transmission are unlikely but could also cause a significant outbreak if they were to occur.",PMC4323406,PMC4323406_4
