This study demonstrates that lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Staphylococcus aureus enhances the severity of respiratory disease in pigs infected with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) in a manner similar to that of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli.,PMC2932768,PMC2932768_0
"LTA from S. Aureus increases the clinical severity of PRCV infection in pigs by exacerbating the severity of clinical signs, but there is no evidence that this clinical exacerbation is associated with over-production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), as previously hypothesised in the context of PRCV infection and LPS.",PMC2932768,PMC2932768_1
"Differences in the modes of action of LTA and LPS may relate to the different ways these compounds are recognised by the host. LTA may be recognised by toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, while LPS recognition is mediated through TLR-4.",PMC2932768,PMC2932768_2
"Pure LTA appears to be a less potent cytokine-inducer than LPS, and the ability of LTA to induce higher concentrations of cytokines has been attributed to its synergistic interactions with other bacterial components such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and peptidoglycan.",PMC2932768,PMC2932768_3
"The recognition of LTA involves not only TLR-2 and CD14, but also CD36. Blocking of this co-receptor and CD14 inhibited the binding of LTA and LTA-induced TNF-α release by human monocytes.",PMC2932768,PMC2932768_4
