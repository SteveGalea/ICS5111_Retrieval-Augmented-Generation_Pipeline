This study is the first to report the antiviral activity of graphene oxide (go) and graphene oxide with silver particles (go-ag) against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.,PMC4847092,PMC4847092_0
"The sizes of silver nanoparticles (ag) on go sheets range from 5 to 25 nm, with about 50% being 10 nm or less in diameter.",PMC4847092,PMC4847092_1
Less inhibition ability (25%) of go-ag against coronavirus was observed compared to the 97% inhibition against influenza virus by ag nanoparticles (0.05 mg/ml) in a previous study.,PMC4847092,PMC4847092_2
"Go sheets alone could only inhibit the infection of enveloped viruses at non-cytotoxic concentrations, while go-ag could inhibit the infection of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses at similar concentrations.",PMC4847092,PMC4847092_3
"The unique structure of graphene oxide sheets could contribute to the inhibition of infection by feline coronavirus with a lipid envelope, and the interactions between go and lipid membranes could attract the absorption of more lipid membranes.",PMC4847092,PMC4847092_4
