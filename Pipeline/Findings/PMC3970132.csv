"The study of reservoir-derived cell culture models has revealed that hantaviruses can infect multiple cell types, but have a tropism to endothelial cells in humans.",PMC3970132,PMC3970132_0
"In rodents, which shed the virus in saliva, urine, and feces, the lung is of interest for hantavirus infection, as transmission of hantaviruses between rodents and also during zoonotic transmission from rodents to humans is mainly through the respiratory route.",PMC3970132,PMC3970132_1
"The study of reservoir-derived cell culture models has highlighted the importance of focusing on cell types that are a target during natural infection or stem from organs that are involved in virus entry, spread, or shedding, such as epithelial cells from the respiratory or renal tract.",PMC3970132,PMC3970132_2
"The generation of reservoir-derived cell culture models from bats, rodents, and insectivores has been established, and these cell lines can serve as a valuable in vitro tool to reveal novel aspects of the hantavirus-host relationship.",PMC3970132,PMC3970132_3
Experience and model systems from the field of bat-borne zoonosis can serve as a blueprint for the hantavirus research community to reveal novel aspects of the hantavirus-host relationship.,PMC3970132,PMC3970132_4
