"A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is being conducted to investigate the effectiveness of azithromycin in indigenous Australian infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis. This study aims to determine whether azithromycin is an effective additional treatment for bronchiolitis in this population, as well as to prevent hospital readmissions from respiratory illnesses within a 6-month period. The study also addresses a large clinical research gap for an important and common cause of hospitalization in indigenous Australian children.",PMC3094234,PMC3094234_0
"The study found that indigenous Australian infants with bronchiolitis have more severe presentations and higher readmission rates compared to non-indigenous infants. This may be due to an increased likelihood of recurrent infections and virus-bacteria interactions from an early age, as well as heavy bacterial colonization of the nasopharynx.",PMC3094234,PMC3094234_1
"The study found that indigenous Australian children and adults have high rates of long-term respiratory dysfunction, which is associated with recurrent hospitalization for acute lower respiratory tract infections (alris) and severity of previous alris.",PMC3094234,PMC3094234_2
"The study found that indigenous Australian infants with bronchiolitis often come from remote communities and may have multiple co-morbidities that influence their discharge. Therefore, the study used length of stay defined as ""ready for respiratory discharge"" to address this limitation.",PMC3094234,PMC3094234_3
"The study found that the impact of variable presentation, particularly the potential influence of azithromycin's acute immune modulation effect, is a limitation of the study. However, the study's design minimizes the impact of variable presentation by standardizing inclusion criteria, limiting enrollment to within 24 hours of hospitalization, and adopting a strategy (double blind, placebo controlled, allocation concealed methodology) that would theoretically distribute any effect equally between groups. The study also noted that in the event that differences in baseline data between groups are found, statistical methods (multivariate analysis) will be used to adjust as required.",PMC3094234,PMC3094234_4
