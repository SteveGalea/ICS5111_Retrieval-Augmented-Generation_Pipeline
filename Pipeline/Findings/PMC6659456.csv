"The study found that the CXCL5/CXCR2 axis promotes the progression of acute lung injury (ALI), as evidenced by the observation that the expression of CXCL5 was significantly increased in LPS-induced ALI and that neutralization of CXCL5 reduced the release of inflammatory factors, pulmonary edema, and lung pathological changes, thereby alleviating LPS-induced ALI.",PMC6659456,PMC6659456_0
"The study also demonstrated that CXCR2, a G-protein-coupled receptor, is involved in the regulation of inflammatory neutrophil recruitment in ALI, and its expression is directly proportional to the severity of ALI.",PMC6659456,PMC6659456_1
"In addition to CXCL5, the study found that the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, which are involved in ALIs, was increased in LPS-induced ALI, and their overexpression exacerbated the progression of ALI, partly by upregulation of inflammatory factors.",PMC6659456,PMC6659456_2
"The study revealed that the CXCL5/CXCR2 axis accelerates the progression of ALI, partly by upregulation of MMP2 and MMP9 in lung tissues with the release of inflammatory factors.",PMC6659456,PMC6659456_3
"These findings could result in new therapeutic options against ALI in the future, as the study suggests that targeting the CXCL5/CXCR2 axis and MMP2/MMP9 overexpression could alleviate ALI.",PMC6659456,PMC6659456_4
