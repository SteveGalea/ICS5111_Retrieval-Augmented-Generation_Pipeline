"The authors identified a significant number of sequence tracts with low hybridization specificity in the atm gene, particularly in regions containing homopolymeric stretches. These tracts can form substantial secondary structures, which can artificially lower the affinity of target to probe and thus lower the hybridization specificity.",PMC549431,PMC549431_0
"The authors found that single base substitution probes showed the lowest inter-sample coefficient of variation across samples, whereas one and two base deletion probes showed higher coefficients of variation than substitution probes. The authors suggest that substantially more control hybridization experiments may be needed to determine baseline fluctuations in the hybridization specificities of insertion and deletion probes relative to those of substitution probes.",PMC549431,PMC549431_1
"The authors noted that duplexes containing two base bulges are generally less stable than those containing a single base mismatch, due to the assumption that helical stacking is interrupted by bulges of two or greater bases in length while it is preserved for one base bulge.",PMC549431,PMC549431_2
"The authors suggest that it is important to consider error rates when assigning the identity of a mutation based on mismatch probe data, especially when dealing with clinical samples, as confirming the identity of specific sequence variants by sequencing is critical to precisely determine the nature of a sequence change within a given sample, even when dealing with slightly ambiguous hybridization data.",PMC549431,PMC549431_3
"The authors noted that the single base substitution probes showed lower inter- and intra-sample variability than one base deletion, two base deletion, and one base insertion probes, in agreement with their findings on duplexes containing single base bulges and mismatches.",PMC549431,PMC549431_4
