"The human α-defensin, rtd-1, inhibits the secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and chemokines CCL3 and CCL5, both in vitro and in vivo.",PMC4661038,PMC4661038_0
"RTD-1 suppresses the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), the master regulator of inflammation, in human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent inducer of NF-κB, and in LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages through the toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2 and 4.",PMC4661038,PMC4661038_1
"RTD-1 inhibits the phosphorylation of several signaling kinases, including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)2, all of which are implicated in inflammatory signaling pathways.",PMC4661038,PMC4661038_2
"RTD-1 stimulates the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), which is a known negative regulator of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, and inhibits the degradation of IκBα, a key regulator of NF-κB activation, in LPS-stimulated human monocytes.",PMC4661038,PMC4661038_3
"The anti-inflammatory properties of RTD-1 are distinct from those of human α-defensins and human β-defensin-3, as RTD-1 inhibits TNF secretion from stimulated blood cells differently from human α-defensins, suggesting that θ-defensin isoforms may be unique tools for dissecting regulatory pathways that determine whether the host response to inflammatory stimuli results in health or disease.",PMC4661038,PMC4661038_4
