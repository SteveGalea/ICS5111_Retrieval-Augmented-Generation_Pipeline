"In this study, reverse genetics was used to generate mutant forms of the glycoprotein (GP) of the filovirus Ebola virus (EBOV) that could not be cleaved by furin, a key host cell factor for EBOV GP entry. This was achieved by introducing mutations at amino acid residues 435 and 436, which are critical for furin cleavage, into the GP gene of EBOV.",PMC3709686,PMC3709686_0
"The mutant GPs were expressed in the context of a replication-competent chimeric virus (RCSFV) and tested for their ability to replicate in cell culture. One of the mutant GPs was found to be able to replicate, indicating that furin-independent entry is possible for EBOV.",PMC3709686,PMC3709686_1
"In another context, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used to detect the presence of GP in virus-infected cells. The binding activities of these mAbs to GP were tested in the context of a different virus, Marburg virus (MARV). Mutant GPs with a deletion or insertion in the GP gene were generated and tested for their ability to bind the mAbs.",PMC3709686,PMC3709686_2
"In a third context, the binding of mAbs to GP was tested in the context of EBOV GP mutants. Mutant GPs with mutations at amino acid residues 435 and 436, which are critical for furin cleavage, were generated and tested for their ability to bind the mAbs. These mutant GPs were found to be able to bind the mAbs, indicating that the mAbs can recognize GP even in the context of mutant GPs.",PMC3709686,PMC3709686_3
"In another study, the binding of mAbs to GP was tested in the context of EBOV GP mutants. Mutant GPs with mutations at amino acid residues 435 and 436, which are critical for furin cleavage, were generated and tested for their ability to bind the mAbs. These mutant GPs were found to be able to bind the mAbs, indicating that the mAbs can recognize GP even in the context of mutant GPs. In addition, mutant GPs with mutations at amino acid residues 411",PMC3709686,PMC3709686_4
