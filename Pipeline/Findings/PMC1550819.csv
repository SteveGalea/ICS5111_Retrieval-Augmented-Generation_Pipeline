"High-fidelity simulation proved to be a crucial tool in the evaluation and implementation of a new, urgently developed sars-specific cardiac arrest protocol, as well as in the subsequent training of team members in the use of unfamiliar protective equipment.",PMC1550819,PMC1550819_0
Simulation was used to detect and correct flaws and omissions in a theoretical protocol specific to the sars patient.,PMC1550819,PMC1550819_1
"Scenario-based simulation training was effective, but resource intense.",PMC1550819,PMC1550819_2
Simulation was suited to teamwork training for disaster management.,PMC1550819,PMC1550819_3
"The authors recommend that simulation be used to prepare precise protocols for future serious events, and suggest that simulation be done both in the teaching area and the actual patient environment for uncommon events.",PMC1550819,PMC1550819_4
"The authors found that simulation was a valuable tool for evaluating a new treatment protocol in a novel and rapidly evolving crisis, and for teamwork training for disaster management.",PMC1550819,PMC1550819_5
"The authors also noted that during their simulation-based training, they discovered unexpected infection control problems with furniture as well as their lack of a scripted transport protocol to move the patient to the ICU.",PMC1550819,PMC1550819_6
"The authors identified the need for educators to have dedicated time freed from their regular duties, and a high ratio of educators to trainees, to ensure careful observation of newly learned infection control practices.",PMC1550819,PMC1550819_7
"The authors found that because of the urgent nature of the crisis and time restraints, they were unable to validate the efficacy of their training, as only one cardiac arrest occurred in the hospital in a patient suspected to have sars.",PMC1550819,PMC1550819_8
"The authors noted that during their simulation-based training, they discovered that the time to don the personal protection system (PPS) was prolonged for a group (3 1/2 to 5 1/2 minutes) in comparison with a single healthcare worker (HCW) donning the same equipment.",PMC1550819,PMC1550819_9
"The authors identified that when simulation occurred in a negative-pressure patient room instead of the teaching area, they discovered unexpected infection control problems with furniture as well as their lack of a scripted transport protocol to move the patient to the ICU.",PMC1550819,PMC1550819_10
"The authors found that during their simulation-based training, they discovered limitations of their approach noted during their training period, including the need for educators to have dedicated time freed from their regular duties, a high ratio of educators to tr",PMC1550819,PMC1550819_11
