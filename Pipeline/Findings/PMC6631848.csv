"Infection of human lung epithelial cells (A549) with the influenza A virus (IAV) leads to the formation of clusters of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) in the cytoplasm, which is a prerequisite for viral replication.",PMC6631848,PMC6631848_0
"The protein IFITM3, which is induced by interferons (IFNs) and has antiviral properties against IAV, forms clusters in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells.",PMC6631848,PMC6631848_1
"In cells infected with IAV, IFITM3 clusters co-localize with IAV NP, suggesting that IFITM3-mediated antiviral activity occurs on endosomal vesicles carrying IAV at early time points of infection.",PMC6631848,PMC6631848_2
"IFITM3 clustering in cells infected with IAV is not observed in cells with a strong nuclear signal for IAV NP, suggesting that infection of this cell type mainly occurs in cells that have not managed to block IAV entry by inducing IFITM3 clustering.",PMC6631848,PMC6631848_3
"IFITM3 clustering in productively infected human primary respiratory cells (hsaepcs) does not appear to efficiently block IAV infection in these primary cells, despite having a much higher basal level in hsaepcs compared to A549 cells.",PMC6631848,PMC6631848_4
