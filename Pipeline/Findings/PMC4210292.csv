"The study identifies a novel and surprising feature of mers-cov entry, which is the activation of viral envelope glycoproteins by furin at two distinct sites during virus entry.",PMC4210292,PMC4210292_0
"The study shows that furin-mediated activation of viral envelope glycoproteins during entry is not an efficient process for mers-cov, as the cleavage events at both sites are not efficient, and sequential activation, first at s1/s2 and then at s2â€², is important for optimal virus entry.",PMC4210292,PMC4210292_1
"The study reveals that mers-cov can be activated by a wide variety of proteases, including cathepsins, trypsin-like serine proteases, and furin-like proteases, suggesting that drug combinations that target these proteases may be potential antiviral candidates.",PMC4210292,PMC4210292_2
"The study demonstrates that mers-cov-activating proteases, such as furin, are important factors that modulate susceptibility to mers-cov infection, as inhibition of these proteases significantly reduces infectivity by mers-cov in various cell types.",PMC4210292,PMC4210292_3
"The study highlights the importance of proteolytic activation of envelope glycoproteins in virus tropism and pathogenicity, as it offers insights into important features of enveloped viruses, such as tropism and pathogenicity.",PMC4210292,PMC4210292_4
