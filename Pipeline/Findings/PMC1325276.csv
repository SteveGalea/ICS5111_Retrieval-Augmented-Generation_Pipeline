"C. difficile intestinal disease is a serious problem that is getting worse, with increasing incidence, virulence, and mortality rates.",PMC1325276,PMC1325276_0
"Prevention is key, as up to 50% of hospitalized patients may become colonized with C. difficile, and transmission is facilitated by the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially fluoroquinolones and Î²-lactams.",PMC1325276,PMC1325276_1
"C. difficile intestinal disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in elderly and immunocompromised patients, as well as in patients with underlying bowel diseases and in critically ill patients.",PMC1325276,PMC1325276_2
"Diagnostic methods are needed to guide treatment, as empiric treatment of all patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea with metronidazole or vancomycin would be a mistake, as up to 43% of cases may be missed by the direct fecal cytotoxin assay and up to 56% may be missed by elisa tests.",PMC1325276,PMC1325276_3
"The toxigenic culture is the best diagnostic method, as it allows for correct diagnosis, outbreak prevention, and surveillance studies, as well as for typing strains and testing antimicrobial susceptibility, but it is not widely used in clinical practice due to technical laboratory expertise, added cost, and longer turnaround time.",PMC1325276,PMC1325276_4
