"The agar1 protein from Streptococcus suis binds to specific palindromic sequences in the DNA, as demonstrated in gel shift assays with the predicted binding sites from S. Suis and E. Faecalis.",PMC4694137,PMC4694137_0
"The agar1 protein is structurally similar to the acetyl-galactosamine repressor (Agar) from Escherichia coli and N-acetylglucosamine repressor (Nagr) from Bacillus subtilis, as revealed by multiple sequence alignments.",PMC4694137,PMC4694137_1
"The solution structure of the agar1 protein was determined using chemical cross-linking assays, revealing both monomeric and dimeric forms.",PMC4694137,PMC4694137_2
The phylogenetic analysis of the PTS system places the agar1 protein in the Pts-V sub-group.,PMC4694137,PMC4694137_3
"The study also provides information on the strains and plasmids used, as well as the primers used in DNA manipulations, and lists the predicted agar1-binding sites in the DNA of both S. Suis and E. Faecalis. Additionally, a table is provided with the predicted AGAR1 (AGAR2) binding sites, and figures illustrate the multiple sequence alignments, binding of agar1 to predicted palindromes, and purification and characterization of the agar1 protein.",PMC4694137,PMC4694137_4
