"A severe outbreak of respiratory disease occurred in a cattle herd in Italy in 2009-2010, caused by a hobi-like pestivirus strain (Italy-1/10-1).",PMC3381567,PMC3381567_0
"The virus was closely related to atypical pestiviruses previously detected in Brazil and Thailand, but more distantly related to classical and border disease viruses.",PMC3381567,PMC3381567_1
"Experimental infection of seronegative calves resulted in mild clinical signs, but fullfilment of Koch's postulates was demonstrated by viremia, viral shedding, and seroconversion.",PMC3381567,PMC3381567_2
"The virus may have been introduced to Europe through contaminated bovine serum products, as it has been detected in batches of fetal calf serum in Brazil and Thailand.",PMC3381567,PMC3381567_3
The genetic and antigenic differences between hobi-like strains and BVDV-1/BVDV-2 suggest the need for specific vaccines against this new virus and the potential impact on animal health and production.,PMC3381567,PMC3381567_4
