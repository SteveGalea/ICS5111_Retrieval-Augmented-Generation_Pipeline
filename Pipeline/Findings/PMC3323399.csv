"In a study on SARS-CoV in civets, 18 of 103 serum samples tested positive, with a 78% seroprevalence in civets from a live animal market in Guangzhou but a lower seroprevalence on farms (<40%).",PMC3323399,PMC3323399_0
Civets selected from one market in January 2004 had a much higher prevalence of SARS-CoV antibodies than those selected from farms in January or from farms and markets in June 2003.,PMC3323399,PMC3323399_1
"The study suggests that mass slaughter of civets on farms might not be necessary to control SARS-CoV spread, as testing in live animal markets and farms for susceptible animals and targeted slaughter for markets or farms with infected animals may be more effective.",PMC3323399,PMC3323399_2
"The study supports the hypothesis that civets are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV, especially in markets, and most infections occurred in markets.",PMC3323399,PMC3323399_3
"The study found no indication of SARS-CoV infection in 15 farmed animals from a civet farm in Jiangxi province in May 2003, while six out of six palm civets collected from a live animal retail market in Shenzhen in May 2003 were positive for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR.",PMC3323399,PMC3323399_4
