"The dna vaccine encoding the mers-cov s1 protein induced potent humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, including high levels of neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific cytokine production.",PMC5411280,PMC5411280_0
"The dna vaccine accelerated virus clearance in ad5-hdpp4-transduced mice infected with the mers-cov emc strain, indicating that the neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov s1 protein were protective.",PMC5411280,PMC5411280_1
"The dna vaccine induced antigen-specific immune responses in mice, including antibody generation, neutralizing antibodies generation, and cytokine secretion, following three immunizations without adjuvant.",PMC5411280,PMC5411280_2
"The dna vaccine did not induce adverse effects in vaccinated animals, suggesting its safety and potential use in non-human primates and camels for gene-based vaccine development.",PMC5411280,PMC5411280_3
"The dna vaccine using the s1 protein of mers-cov as an antigen was effective in eliciting antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, supporting its use as an effective target for gene-based vaccine development against different mers-cov strains.",PMC5411280,PMC5411280_4
