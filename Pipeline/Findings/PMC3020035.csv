"The study reports the first structural characterization of an isolated hemagglutinin (HA) receptor-binding domain (RBD) from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus, expressed and refolded in Escherichia coli.",PMC3020035,PMC3020035_0
"The HA-RBD domain, which encompasses residues 63 to 286, retains the same three-dimensional structure as found on the surface of infectious virions, including antigenic epitopes, receptor-binding pocket, and disulfide bridges.",PMC3020035,PMC3020035_1
"The results provide a structural basis supporting the use of isolated HA-RBD constructs generated in E. Coli as candidates for protein-based vaccines, as human serum antibodies from H1N1-infected patients are able to recognize the isolated HA-RBD.",PMC3020035,PMC3020035_2
"The study highlights the potential for small-molecule inhibitors that can block the binding of sialic acid, as the isolated HA-RBD offers four therapeutic advantages, including increased immunogenicity due to the lack of glycosylation sites.",PMC3020035,PMC3020035_3
The metastable folding of the prefusion form of the HA protein and soluble fragments of the HA2 membrane fusion domain expressed in E. Coli represent challenges for virus-free generation of the entire HA protein for vaccine production and biological characterization.,PMC3020035,PMC3020035_4
