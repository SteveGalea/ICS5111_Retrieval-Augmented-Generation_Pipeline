"The unique immune features of bats, such as reduced inflammation and suppression of virus replication, are counteracted by increased constitutive expression of interferons and unique isg expressions (figure 1).",PMC6410205,PMC6410205_0
"Bats harbor viruses due to their reduced inflammation and persistence of viruses, such as nipah virus, marburg virus, and henipahviruses (Nipah, Hendra, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, Marburg, and Ebola viruses) (sections 3 and 4).",PMC6410205,PMC6410205_1
"Bats have a prolonged incubation period and low-level persistent infection with viruses, such as marburg virus and nipah virus, which can lead to horizontal transmission (section 4).",PMC6410205,PMC6410205_2
"Bats have a reduced inflammatory response, such as reduced activation of dna sensors, STING, and TBK1, leading to reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα (section 2).",PMC6410205,PMC6410205_3
"The evolution of flight in bats necessitated the evolution of immune tolerance and suppression of inflammation, which led to reduced activation of dna sensors, STING, and TBK1, and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα (section 2).",PMC6410205,PMC6410205_4
"The evolution of flight in bats also led to a reduced innate immune response, such as reduced activation of dna sensors, STING, and TBK1, and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα (section 2).",PMC6410205,PMC6410205_5
"Bats have a unique antiviral immune response, such as increased constitutive expression of interferons and unique isg expressions, which counteract the reduced innate immune response (figure 1).",PMC6410205,PMC6410205_6
"Bats have a reduced innate immune response, such as reduced activation of dna sensors, STING, and TBK1, leading to reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, which allows for virus persistence (section 4).",PMC6410205,PMC6410205_7
