"Ranavirus: A group of viruses with a broad host range, including fish, amphibians, and invertebrates, with interspecies and interclass transmission documented through natural reassortments and chimeric recombinant viruses. Specific amino acid changes have been identified as putatively associated with differences in host specificity.",PMC3125225,PMC3125225_0
"Betanodavirus: Variations in host specificity among viral strains, with specific amino acid changes identified as putatively associated with differences in host specificity.",PMC3125225,PMC3125225_1
Isavirus: Changes located in the haemagglutinin (hpr) and in the fusion protein associated with outbreaks in Atlantic salmon. Phylogenetic analysis indicating potential involvement in a change in host specificity.,PMC3125225,PMC3125225_2
"Herpesvirus: Phylogenetic analysis revealing discordances between fish herpesvirus and host lineages, suggesting the existence of interspecies transmission. Field evidence of interspecies transmission of herpesvirus in mollusk bivalves.",PMC3125225,PMC3125225_3
"Aquabirnavirus: Natural reassortment among field isolates, potentially contributing to adaptation and replication in new hosts, as well as a wide host range and diversity of ipnv (and aquabirnavirus in general) genogroups.",PMC3125225,PMC3125225_4
