"A birth cohort study in India has shown that children with a history of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in infancy have lower forced expiratory volume and flow rate indices at age 3, after adjusting for current weight, height, gender, and baseline tidal volume. This effect was observed for all viral ARIs, irrespective of specific aetiology, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human coronavirus (hCoV).",PMC7047475,PMC7047475_0
"In a well-designed, prospective birth cohort study, significantly lower forced expiratory volume (FEV) and flow rate indices were associated with ARI episode in infancy, female gender, and low current weight at age 3.",PMC7047475,PMC7047475_1
"The study also found that children with a history of ARI in infancy had lower FEV and flow rate indices at age 3, and higher airway resistance after adjusting for age, sex, weight, and height.",PMC7047475,PMC7047475_2
"The study observed that children with a history of ARI in infancy had lower tidal volume (TV) and tidal expiratory flow (TEF)/TV ratio at age 3, but these effects were not statistically significant.",PMC7047475,PMC7047475_3
"The study found that children with a history of ARI in infancy had significantly higher total respiratory resistance (Rrs) and resistance at 5 Hz (R5) at age 3, after adjusting for age, sex, weight, and height.",PMC7047475,PMC7047475_4
