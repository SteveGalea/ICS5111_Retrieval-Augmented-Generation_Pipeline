"Overexpression of nsp2, a non-structural protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), significantly increases the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and Cox-2, as well as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and phosphorylated NF-κB (p-NF-κB) in Helena cells, indicating a strong pro-inflammatory effect of PRRSV nsp2.",PMC3443020,PMC3443020_0
"The study demonstrates that nsp2 is a potent inducer of pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways in PRRSV-infected cells, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of PRRSV.",PMC3443020,PMC3443020_1
"The findings suggest that nsp2 plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammatory responses during PRRSV infection, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying PRRSV pathogenesis.",PMC3443020,PMC3443020_2
"The study also reveals that PRRSV nsp2 can significantly increase the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and Cox-2 in Helena cells, which may have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of PRRSV-associated diseases.",PMC3443020,PMC3443020_3
"The research provides insights into the role of PRRSV nsp2 in the regulation of inflammatory responses, which can contribute to the development of strategies for the prevention and management of PRRSV-associated diseases.",PMC3443020,PMC3443020_4
