"In a study examining the ability of different cytokines to promote the fusion of human fibroblast cells, it was found that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was the most effective promoter, with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) also showing significant promoting effects.",PMC3519774,PMC3519774_0
"In a study investigating the effect of different types of extracellular matrix (ECM) on the migration and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts, it was discovered that ECM prepared from decellularized human liver tissue promoted both migration and proliferation more effectively than ECM prepared from decellularized human skin tissue.",PMC3519774,PMC3519774_1
"In an investigation into the potential of using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a source of vascular cells for tissue engineering applications, it was found that HUVECs could form functional capillary-like structures in vitro, and that these structures exhibited similar morphological and functional features to those found in vivo.",PMC3519774,PMC3519774_2
"In a study examining the effect of different types of physical exercise on the expression of genes associated with bone metabolism in human osteoblasts, it was revealed that high-intensity weightlifting training led to significant increases in the expression of several key bone-metabolism-related genes, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (BGLAP), and osteoproteger (TNFRSF11B).",PMC3519774,PMC3519774_3
"In a study investigating the potential of using human dermal fibroblasts as a source of cells for tissue engineering applications, it was found that fibroblasts isolated from skin tissue harvested from patients undergoing surgical procedures exhibited similar morphological and functional features to those found in fibroblasts isolated from healthy individuals.",PMC3519774,PMC3519774_4
