"A deletion mutant of the diarrhoeal virus Norovirus (NV) containing a 3'-terminal region of the nonstructural viral polyprotein (nsp2) was constructed by replacing this region with a 3'-terminal region of the structural capsid protein (VP1) of simian rotavirus (SRV). This mutant, designated NV-VP1, was found to be replication-competent in human intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting that the region of nsp2 containing the polyprotease domain is not essential for NV replication.",PMC109662,PMC109662_0
"Another mutant, designated NV-VP1(d10), was constructed by replacing the majority (41 nucleotides) of the 3'-terminal region of NV nsp2 with a region of VP1. The replication of this mutant was significantly impaired, suggesting that a region required for NV virus propagation is contained within the 3'-terminal 224 nucleotides of the nsp2 b region.",PMC109662,PMC109662_1
"A third mutant, designated NV-VP1(d10)-M, was constructed by replacing the 3'-terminal region of NV nsp2 with the 3'-terminal region of the SRV structural protein VP6. This mutant was not replication-competent, suggesting that the region of nsp2 containing the polyprotease domain is essential for NV replication.",PMC109662,PMC109662_2
"The mutant NV-VP1(d10) was further characterized by assessing replication of NV-VP1(d10) RNA in BHK-21 cells. The data showed that the mutant was replication-competent, and although the data were not quantitative, there appeared to be little difference in the amount of replication of NV-VP1(d10) and NV RNA.",PMC109662,PMC109662_3
"The study also showed that the NV-VP1(d10) mutant, like the wild-type virus, was capable of forming infectious virus particles, as demonstrated by the detection of both positive-sense and negative-sense RNA synthesis in BHK-21 cells transfected with NV-VP1(d10) RNA.",PMC109662,PMC109662_4
