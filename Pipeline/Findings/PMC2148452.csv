"Immunogold labeling of ci-mpr and ap-1 in parotid and pancreatic acinar cells reveals their localization in clathrin-coated buds emerging from immature granules, as well as in tgn membranes with less dense contents.",PMC2148452,PMC2148452_0
"Immunogold labeling of cathepsin b in parotid and pancreatic acinar cells shows its localization in clathrin-coated buds emerging from immature granules and in tgn membranes with less dense contents, but not in mature granules or lysosomes.",PMC2148452,PMC2148452_1
"Immunoelectron microscopic labeling of syntaxin 6 and ap-1 in parotid and pancreatic acinar cells indicates their colocalization in clathrin-coated buds emerging from immature granules, as well as in tgn membranes with less dense contents.",PMC2148452,PMC2148452_2
"Biochemical analysis of cathepsin b in rat parotid and pancreatic tissues shows that it enters the regulated secretory pathway as a precursor form and is converted to the mature, lysosomal form at a slower time scale than in endocrine cells.",PMC2148452,PMC2148452_3
"Immunoblotting of parotid tissue reveals the predominant steady-state form of intracellular cathepsin b to be the mature, lysosomal form, but trace amounts of prob can still be detected in the unstimulated state.",PMC2148452,PMC2148452_4
