"The study found evidence of a direct, exposure-response relationship between Schistosoma japonicum (S. Japonicum) infection and parenchymal fibrosis, with higher prevalence and intensity of fibrosis observed in people with higher S. Japonicum infection intensities.",PMC2872638,PMC2872638_0
"Declines in hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and portal vein dilation were observed following treatment of S. Japonicum infections, but the prevalence of severe parenchymal fibrosis remained high and may even progress despite treatment.",PMC2872638,PMC2872638_1
"The study suggests that some morbidity may not reverse within five years of treatment, highlighting the importance of measures to prevent new infections as well as treating current disease.",PMC2872638,PMC2872638_2
"The study found that high rates of reinfection were common following treatment of S. Japonicum infections, underscoring the importance of measures to prevent new infections.",PMC2872638,PMC2872638_3
"The study suggests that ultrasound-detectable liver fibrosis is associated with S. Japonicum infection status and intensity, controlling for age, sex, and year of ultrasound examination, and this measure can be used to monitor S. Japonicum-induced morbidity. Other ultrasound measures, including hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, were less clearly associated with infection.",PMC2872638,PMC2872638_4
