"Ehpnt, a protein involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, is localized to acidified compartments, such as lysosomes and phagosomes, in the parasitic protozoan Entamoeba histolytica.",PMC2901640,PMC2901640_0
Ehpnt possesses enzymological properties suitable for acidic environments and may be involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species by supplying nadph as a reducing power by using a proton gradient across the lysosomal and phagosomal membranes.,PMC2901640,PMC2901640_1
"The amino-terminal region of ehpnt is not a canonical mitochondrion-targeting peptide, as it lacks basic residues such as arginine or lysine, despite being previously considered to be mitosomal based on the resemblance of the amino-terminal region to the potential mitochondrion-targeting peptide.",PMC2901640,PMC2901640_2
"Ehpnt was distributed to the membrane of vesicles and vacuoles, including lysosomes, phagosomes, and endosomes, but not to mitosomes, and the dependence of ehpnt expression on ph was not directly demonstrated, as our attempt to repress ehpnt expression by gene silencing failed.",PMC2901640,PMC2901640_3
"The generation of nadph by membrane-associated ehpnt in acidified compartments, such as lysosomes and phagosomes, depends upon a proton-motive force, which is likely generated by v-atpase localized to the acidified compartment and also the nonacidified compartment.",PMC2901640,PMC2901640_4
