"The prolonged hemorrhagic shock model constructed in this study demonstrates that a more severe shock bp induces increased levels of systemic inflammation and intestinal mucosal barrier damage, suggesting that systemic inflammation possesses an etiopathological relationship with intestinal injury.",PMC4140717,PMC4140717_0
"The results reveal that serum dao, an indicator of metabolic acidosis, can reflect the severity of intestinal damage in prolonged hemorrhagic shock.",PMC4140717,PMC4140717_1
Statistical analyses reveal that serum dao shows potential in evaluating the severity of prolonged hemorrhagic shock.,PMC4140717,PMC4140717_2
The study confirms that increased serum dao levels are associated with increased degrees of systemic inflammation in a rabbit model.,PMC4140717,PMC4140717_3
"The study suggests that serum dao may be a potential indicator of the severity of prolonged hemorrhagic shock, requiring further study in clinical trials.",PMC4140717,PMC4140717_4
