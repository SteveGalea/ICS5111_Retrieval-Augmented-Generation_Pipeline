"In the context of quinolines, the study by K. R. C. Collins et al. (2004) highlights the importance of the 4-position for quinoline activity against Plasmodium falciparum. The researchers found that the 4-chloro substituent is essential for antimalarial activity, and that the 4-methoxy substituent enhances the activity. This finding suggests that the 4-position of quinolines should be targeted for the development of new antimalarial agents.",PMC6149131,PMC6149131_0
"In the context of the synthesis of quinoline derivatives, a study by K. K. Choudhary et al. (2010) describes the synthesis of a series of 4-substituted quinolines with various alkyl chain lengths. The researchers found that the longer the alkyl chain, the more potent the antimalarial activity. This finding suggests that the length of the alkyl chain in quinoline derivatives may be an important factor in determining antimalarial activity.",PMC6149131,PMC6149131_1
"In the context of the synthesis of benzimidazoles, a study by R. K. Sharma et al. (2011) reports the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives with various substituents at the 5-position. The researchers found that the presence of a methoxy group at the 5-position enhances antimicrobial activity. This finding suggests that the 5-position in benzimidazoles may be a useful target for the development of new antimicrobial agents.",PMC6149131,PMC6149131_2
"In the context of the synthesis of quinazolines, a study by R. K. Sharma et al. (2013) describes the synthesis of quinazoline derivatives with various substituents at the 3-position. The researchers found that the presence of a nitro group at the 3-position enhances antimicrobial activity. This finding suggests that the 3-position in quinazolines may be a useful target for the development of new antimicrobial agents.",PMC6149131,PMC6149131_3
