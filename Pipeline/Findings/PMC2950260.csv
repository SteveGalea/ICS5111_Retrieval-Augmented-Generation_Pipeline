"The study found a significant association between bacterial infection of the airways and acute wheezing episodes in young children, independent of viral infection, suggesting that bacteria may contribute independently to the burden of wheezing symptoms.",PMC2950260,PMC2950260_0
"Viral infection is closely associated with acute exacerbations of asthma, and viruses were identified in 65% of wheezing episodes in the children in the study. However, the type of virus itself is not causally related to symptoms, as bacteria were also more commonly found in wheezing episodes, but with similar distribution when comparing young children with and without wheezing episodes.",PMC2950260,PMC2950260_1
"The study found that bacterial colonization in the copenhagen prospective study on asthma in childhood was similar to that reported in previous cohort studies, although S aureus seemed slightly more common in the study cohort, possibly due to the high rate of breast feeding.",PMC2950260,PMC2950260_2
"The study found that bacteria were more commonly found in wheezing episodes but with similar distribution when comparing young children with and without wheezing episodes. This finding is important because it may have an important impact on treatment, as clinical trials with antibiotic therapy will be required to determine whether this increased detection of bacteria during wheezing episodes has clinical effects that are amenable to modification by appropriate therapy.",PMC2950260,PMC2950260_3
"The study found that bacterial infection of the airways and acute wheezing episodes in young children were similar to but independent of viral infection, suggesting that bacteria may contribute independently to the burden of wheezing symptoms. This finding is significant because it may also contribute to an understanding of the disappointing results from trials of anti-asthma therapies in wheezing illness in early childhood.",PMC2950260,PMC2950260_4
