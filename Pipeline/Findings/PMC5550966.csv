The paper presents two parallel approaches to anticipate disease emergence: extended early warning systems (ews) and Cox's delta (δ) as a likelihood-ratio test for emergence. Both methods are applied to weekly time series data of diseases emerging over different time scales.,PMC5550966,PMC5550966_0
"Both approaches perform best under different conditions. Cox's δ reliably detects emergence over fast time scales, where the null hypothesis is strongly disfavoured. Ews perform best at detecting long-term trends in the time series, where there is a more gradual approach to the epidemic transition.",PMC5550966,PMC5550966_1
"The paper finds that, apart from the coefficient of variation, all ews undergo similar behaviour regardless of the time scale of emergence. More advanced time averaging methods may be needed for very fast emergence to detect a strong signal.",PMC5550966,PMC5550966_2
"The paper concludes that the methods are complementary, performing best under differing conditions. Cox's δ reliably detects emergence over fast time scales, where the null hypothesis is strongly disfavoured. Ews perform best at detecting long-term trends in the time series, where there is a more gradual approach to the epidemic transition.",PMC5550966,PMC5550966_3
"The paper highlights that the behaviour of the coefficient of variation and Kolmogorov complexity prior to the transition means they both perform poorly as indicators of emergence. The remaining ews (the mean, variance, index of dispersion, autocorrelation, correlation time and entropy) have a behaviour that is resilient to parameter changes and reliable in the face of stochasticity, making them strong candidate ews.",PMC5550966,PMC5550966_4
