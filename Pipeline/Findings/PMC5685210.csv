"In May 2016, there was an EU-wide coverage for Zika virus (ZikaV) molecular diagnostics, with 24 out of 30 EU/EEA countries reporting implementation. However, only 17 out of 44 laboratories conducting ZikaV serology had information on previous flavivirus infections or vaccinations, which is crucial for the interpretation of test results.",PMC5685210,PMC5685210_0
"The availability of validation materials, positive controls, and personnel were identified as the main challenges for implementing ZikaV diagnostics in EU/EEA national reference laboratories. Fifteen out of 44 laboratories cited the cost of commercial tests as an obstacle for test implementation, and five out of 44 laboratories did not receive funding for developing and/or implementing in-house tests.",PMC5685210,PMC5685210_1
The lack of information provided by clinicians requesting diagnostics was identified as a major gap in 27 out of 44 laboratories. This information is necessary for the interpretation of test results and for choosing the most appropriate test.,PMC5685210,PMC5685210_2
"In May 2016, the coverage and capacity of ZikaV diagnostics in EU/EEA national reference laboratories were observed to be sufficient. However, awareness and facilitation of the acceptance of laboratory accreditation for novel diagnostics implemented in emerging situations are required, as is improved access to controls and validation panels for both molecular and serological tests.",PMC5685210,PMC5685210_3
"Increased awareness among clinicians to provide all necessary background information, and systems should be implemented to assure provision of necessary interpretation data. National and/or EU contingency funding should be established to ensure adequate and robust laboratory preparedness and response.",PMC5685210,PMC5685210_4
