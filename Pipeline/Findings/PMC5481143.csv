The study isolated plasmablast-derived antibodies (abs) from a Zika virus (ZikV)-infected individual with unique characteristics. These abs had no or limited somatic hypermutation (SHM) but bound to an immunodominant ZikV epitope that was not present on any of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes.,PMC5481143,PMC5481143_0
The study found that the human IgG p1f12 mab could neutralize ZikV with a neutralization titer of approximately 2 μg/mL.,PMC5481143,PMC5481143_1
The study suggested that shm-independent pathways may generate neutralizing abs in responses against ZikV.,PMC5481143,PMC5481143_2
The study found that low levels of SHM were present in ZikV-specific mabs derived from epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized memory B cells.,PMC5481143,PMC5481143_3
"The study isolated 13 new ZikV-specific mabs from memory B cells, three of which had very little SHM. These mabs were isolated from memory cells sorted with soluble and monomeric ZikV envelope proteins and did not bind to the prM/E proteins expressed in cells, precluding mapping of the interaction using an ala-mutated envelope panel.",PMC5481143,PMC5481143_4
"The study found that low levels of SHM were present in ZikV-specific mabs derived from memory B cells isolated from plasma samples collected during the acute phase in individuals previously infected with ZikV, dengue virus, or yellow fever virus (YFV).",PMC5481143,PMC5481143_5
The study found that plasmablast-derived mabs from a ZikV-infected individual with neurological complications compatible with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) bound to an immunodominant ZikV epitope that was not present on any of the four DENV serotypes.,PMC5481143,PMC5481143_6
"The study found that plasmablast-derived mabs from a ZikV-infected individual with neurological complications compatible with GBS bound to an immunodominant ZikV epitope that was not present on any of the four DENV serotypes or on ZikV, dengue virus, or YFV-immortalized",PMC5481143,PMC5481143_7
