"Vips, a Perl-based web server, has been developed for predicting RNA secondary structures and intramolecular RNA folding pathways with pseudoknots.",PMC3818432,PMC3818432_0
"Vips integrates RNA secondary structure prediction, comparison, and pseudoknot prediction software to improve the accuracy rate of predicted intramolecular RNA folding pathways with pseudoknots.",PMC3818432,PMC3818432_1
"Vips can locate short sub-structures covered by stable pseudoknot structures, preventing overestimation of predicted intramolecular RNA folding pathways with pseudoknots.",PMC3818432,PMC3818432_2
"Vips can facilitate users in locating candidate intramolecular RNA folding pathways with pseudoknots from their target sequences quickly, due to its availability as an online service and its ability to perform single sequence input.",PMC3818432,PMC3818432_3
"Vips has been used to predict intramolecular RNA folding pathways with pseudoknots in viral genomes, and has identified potential intramolecular RNA folding pathways with pseudoknots in viral genomes, such as bat coronavirus (nc_010436) and human enterovirus (nc_013114) in group 4, as well as human rhinovirus C (nc_001477) in group 1.",PMC3818432,PMC3818432_4
"Vips has also been used to locate potential intramolecular RNA folding pathways with pseudoknots in selected zinc finger genes from ires groups 1 and 4 candidates in viral genomes, as well as potential intramolecular RNA folding pathways with pseudoknots in 500 randomly selected viral genomes analyzed by vips.",PMC3818432,PMC3818432_5
