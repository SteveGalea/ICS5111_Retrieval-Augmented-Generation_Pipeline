"During an outbreak in Jordan in 2015, a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with a deletion in open reading frame (ORF) 4a was identified. This deletion, which contains a predicted β-sheet belonging to the classical double-stranded RNA binding αβββα fold, was present in all 13 viruses from patients in the outbreak and may affect the virus' ability to bind double-stranded RNA.",PMC4806954,PMC4806954_0
"In addition to the ORF4a deletion, a small deletion in ORF3 was detected in a subset of samples collected later in the outbreak. This deletion may be an adaptation resulting from sustained human-to-human transmission.",PMC4806954,PMC4806954_1
"Cytopathic changes were observed in cells infected with viruses from clinical samples Jordan-1-2015 and Jordan-10-2015, but not in cells infected with viruses from other samples. Pairwise comparison of Jordan-1-2015 with Jordan-10-2015 revealed that both viruses were highly similar, with no cell culture adaptive mutations observed in the genome sequence of Jordan-1-2015.",PMC4806954,PMC4806954_2
"The data suggest that adaptive pressures possibly exerted by the human host may operate on the ORF4a and ORF3 regions, although future studies are needed to determine the roles of these proteins.",PMC4806954,PMC4806954_3
"The finding that all viruses analyzed contained the ORF4a deletion suggests that all patients were infected with the same virus. The data also suggest that MERS-CoV ORF4a and ORF3 can acquire deletions by selection or by chance, and whether these deletions affect the transmissibility or pathogenicity of this particular MERS-CoV strain needs to be addressed. The study underscores the need for close monitoring of the molecular evolution of MERS-CoV.",PMC4806954,PMC4806954_4
