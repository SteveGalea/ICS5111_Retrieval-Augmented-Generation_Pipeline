"The current epidemiological situation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/H5N1 is characterized by human cases, primarily in Asia and Africa, with the majority of cases attributed to direct exposure to infected birds. While extensive studies have not yet been undertaken, data suggest that HPAI A/H5N1 is not causing widespread undetected asymptomatic or mild cases.",PMC2600097,PMC2600097_0
"The current pandemic alert phase is phase 3: human infection(s) with a new subtype, but no human-to-human spread, or at most rare instances of spread to a close contact. In the UK, for planning purposes, phase 6, indicating an increased and sustained transmission in the general population, has been subdivided into four alert levels, dependent on the extent of activity within the UK.",PMC2600097,PMC2600097_1
"The overarching UK pandemic contingency plan focuses on antivirals, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand washing and voluntary isolation of cases, effective handling of contacts, limiting non-essential travel and mass gatherings of people to minimize the impact of the pandemic while a vaccine is in development against the pandemic virus.",PMC2600097,PMC2600097_2
"The main defence against pandemic influenza is a vaccine matched to the pandemic strain. The UK has purchased a small supply of a human A/H5N1 vaccine that can be used for experimental purposes and deployed in an emergency to priority groups. Antivirals of the neuraminidase inhibitor class, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), are likely to be one of the key measures against pandemic influenza, while a vaccine is being developed.",PMC2600097,PMC2600097_3
"Community mitigation methods, such as travel restrictions, school closures, and community isolation, will not prevent a pandemic, but will delay its spread. Border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread of the pandemic by more than 1–2 weeks if 90% effective, and by only 2–3 weeks unless more than 99% effective. Intuitively imposing international travel restrictions would seem like an effective means to reduce and/or delay spread of a pandemic virus, but modelling has indicated that such measures are unlikely to delay an epidemic significantly.",PMC2600097,PMC2600097_4
School closure during the peak of a pandemic might reduce clinical peak attack rates in children by up to 40% and slow the epidemic,PMC2600097,PMC2600097_5
