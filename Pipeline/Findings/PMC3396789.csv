"The study found that dcr3, a potent immunomodulatory factor, was significantly elevated in the serum of sepsis patients but not in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of noninfectious causes.",PMC3396789,PMC3396789_0
"Dcr3 was shown to be a reliable indicator of sepsis diagnosis, as it differentiated between sepsis and SIRS of noninfectious causes, and it possessed a higher sensitivity and specificity compared to other biomarkers expressed in sepsis, such as procalcitonin (PCT) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±).",PMC3396789,PMC3396789_1
"The study also revealed that dcr3 levels were significantly higher in sepsis patients with a poor prognosis, as it predicted the 28-day mortality rate independently of acute physiologic and pathologic (APACHE II) scores.",PMC3396789,PMC3396789_2
"The study found that dcr3 expression was detected in a wide array of human cells, including endothelial cells, lung bronchial epithelial cells, and dermal keratinocytes, and it was localized in all inflamed tissue components and infiltrating inflammatory cells with one exception, the germinal centers of reactive follicles (T-cell rich area).",PMC3396789,PMC3396789_3
"The study suggested that dcr3 could be a novel target of sepsis therapy, as it mediated all immunosuppressive features observed in sepsis, such as apoptosis of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, suppression of human leukocyte antigen-dr surface expression on DCs and macrophages, phagocytic activity of macrophages, and skewing of the T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) and 2 (Th2) balance toward Th2 (immunosuppressive phenotype) responses.",PMC3396789,PMC3396789_4
