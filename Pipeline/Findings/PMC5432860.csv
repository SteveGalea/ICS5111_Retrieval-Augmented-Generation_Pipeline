The crystal structure of the nsp15 protein from the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus reveals a novel domain with RNA-binding properties that could potentially serve as a scaffold for RNA assembly.,PMC5432860,PMC5432860_0
"Mutations in the RNA-binding domain of the nsp15 protein from MERS and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses lead to impaired RNA binding and decreased viral replication, suggesting a critical role for this domain in viral pathogenesis.",PMC5432860,PMC5432860_1
"The crystal structures of the nsp15 RNA-binding domains from MERS and SARS viruses reveal structural and sequence similarities, suggesting a conserved RNA-binding mechanism among these viruses.",PMC5432860,PMC5432860_2
"The crystal structure of the nsp15 protein from MERS virus also provides insight into the fold and structural details of the RNA-binding domain in alphacoronaviruses, which can be used to design RNA-binding ligands for potential therapeutic applications.",PMC5432860,PMC5432860_3
"The structures of the RNA-binding domains from MERS and SARS viruses can be used as templates to predict the structures of RNA-binding domains from other alphacoronaviruses, such as the novel human alphacoronavirus, which can facilitate the study of their roles in viral pathogenesis and the development of RNA-targeting therapeutics.",PMC5432860,PMC5432860_4
