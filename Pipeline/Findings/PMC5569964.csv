"In urbanized communities with high risk of disasters, such as Hong Kong, low levels of disaster-related risk perception are observed despite the high frequency of extreme events. Only 12.8% of the Hong Kong community perceived disasters as a major threat, and 57.1% believed that Hong Kong had lower disaster awareness compared to other major metropolitan cities.",PMC5569964,PMC5569964_0
