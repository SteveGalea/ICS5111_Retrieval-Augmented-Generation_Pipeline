"The effectiveness of weekend-extension strategies in controlling and preventing influenza epidemics depends on the length and pattern of extensions, as well as the compliance level of businesses.",PMC3146865,PMC3146865_0
"The three-day extension strategy is the most effective to confine the spatial spread of seasonal flu, as it greatly reduces the travel between homes and workplaces and allows people to move freely to anywhere they want during the extended weekend.",PMC3146865,PMC3146865_1
"Longer and less frequent interruptions on influenza transmission would be more effective in disease control than shorter and more frequent interruptions, as the transmission of influenza would be doubly effective if infectious individuals constantly meet with susceptible individuals at both homes and workplaces.",PMC3146865,PMC3146865_2
"The weekend-extension strategy could be a feasible measure for countries with limited health resources, as it does not require stockpiles of vaccines and antiviral drugs for fighting emerging infectious diseases that are poorly understood and unprepared for, such as new strains of influenza, SARS, and Ebola.",PMC3146865,PMC3146865_3
"The shares of infections at neighbor households and service places are greatly enlarged by the three discontinuous extension strategies, as the possible routes for transmission are quickly exhausted at homes, and epidemics cannot further develop until individuals go back to work.",PMC3146865,PMC3146865_4
