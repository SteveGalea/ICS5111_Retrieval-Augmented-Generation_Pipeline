"A novel circovirus, named mink circovirus (Micv), was identified in mink with diarrhea in Dalian, China, during September-October 2013.",PMC4178405,PMC4178405_0
"Micv has a complete circular genome of 1,753 nucleotides with highest similarity (64.1%) to the bat circovirus (Btcv-xor) recently identified in bats by metagenomic analysis.",PMC4178405,PMC4178405_1
"Micv shares 50.7-79.7% amino acid identity with circoviruses from pigs (Pcv2), birds (Gocv), dogs (Dogcv-1698), and bats (Btcv-xor), respectively, indicating a new circovirus species.",PMC4178405,PMC4178405_2
"Micv was only found in mink with diarrhea, suggesting a strong relationship between the virus and disease.",PMC4178405,PMC4178405_3
"The biological significance of widespread cyclovirus, circovirus, and circovirus-like virus infections in other domesticated and wild animals remains unknown, warranting further investigation.",PMC4178405,PMC4178405_4
