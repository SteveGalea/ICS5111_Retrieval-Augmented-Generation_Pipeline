"In the section discussing the use case of searching for a mouse gene responding to pathogen infection, it is found that the ""mitogen-activated protein"" was detected in the mass spectrometry experiment when the macrophage was infected by Bacillus anthracis or Salmonella typhimurium. This suggests that these proteins play a role in the host innate immune response to bacterial infection.",PMC2239001,PMC2239001_0
The section on the use case of searching for organism-centric experiment data in the resource center reveals that all experiments carried out with Bacillus anthracis and Salmonella typhimurium are listed when the user selects the corresponding organism. This enables the user to easily navigate and access the relevant experimental data for these pathogens.,PMC2239001,PMC2239001_1
"The section on integrating ""omics"" data across different databases highlights the significance of this for systems biology and cyberinfrastructure. It explains that the availability of integrated data in the resource center, such as transcriptional and proteomics data for Bacillus anthracis and Salmonella typhimurium, greatly facilitates the analysis of host-pathogen interactions using the framework of cyberinfrastructure.",PMC2239001,PMC2239001_2
The section on the use case of querying all proteins that interact with secretion system chaperones and further refining that list reveals that the user can query all proteins that have been experimentally demonstrated to interact with secretion system chaperones and refine that list by choosing proteins that have been annotated as having signal peptide characteristics and are conserved among a list of pathogens. This allows for a more sophisticated search and facilitates the discovery of potential drug targets and vaccines.,PMC2239001,PMC2239001_3
"The section on the significance of bioinformatics, genome-sequencing, and high-throughput genome-wide experimentation (such as proteomics and transcriptomics) for systems biology and cyberinfrastructure explains that the availability of integrated data in the resource center, such as transcriptional and proteomics data for Bacillus anthracis and Salmonella typhimurium, greatly facilitates the analysis of host-pathogen interactions using the framework of cyberinfrastructure. This enables the user to discover potential diagnostics, drug targets, and vaccines. It also highlights the importance of integrating ""omics",PMC2239001,PMC2239001_4
