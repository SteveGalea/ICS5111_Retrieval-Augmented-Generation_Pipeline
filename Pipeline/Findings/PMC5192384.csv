"The study identified several interferon-induced protein (Isg) proteins, including Isg15, Isg2, IsgL, mx1, and mx2, that were significantly upregulated in both the yn13-infected group and the yn144-infected group, suggesting that these Isg proteins may participate in the process of resisting pedv infection. However, no significant change was found in Isg1 and Isg2 in the two pedv-infected groups, indicating the need for further investigations to elucidate the upregulation of these Isg proteins.",PMC5192384,PMC5192384_0
"The study found that α-tubulin and β-tubulin were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in both the yn13-infected group and the yn144-infected group, which is consistent with the findings of other authors who reported that α-tubulin was upregulated during infection of some other coronaviruses, such as transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), while the downregulation of β-tubulins in host cells was also found during the infection of porcine circovirus type 2.",PMC5192384,PMC5192384_1
"The study identified that most heat shock protein (Hsp) 90-identified proteins, including Hsp90β1, Hsp90β1a, Hsp70, Hsp40α1, and Hsp40C10, were significantly upregulated in the yn13-infected group but were downregulated in the yn144-infected group, indicating that Hsp90 and Hsp70 may possess a positive effect on the replication of pedv, while the downregulation of these Hsps may inhibit the replication of yn144.",PMC5192384,PMC5192384_2
"The study found that the translation of most subgenomic messenger RNA (sgmRNA) transcripts requires eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), which is composed of eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G. The study also found that eIF4G1 was upreg",PMC5192384,PMC5192384_3
