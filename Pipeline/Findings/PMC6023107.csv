"The randomized intervention comparing antimicrobial soaps to regular soaps in a community setting showed that triclosan (tc)-containing soaps did not prevent infectious disease in young children and their mothers, despite high levels of exposure to tcs from other sources and the prevalence of viral infection.",PMC6023107,PMC6023107_0
"Mothers in the tc group had higher urinary triclosan levels than those in the non-tc group, but babies in the tc group had lower antibiotic prescriptions than those in the non-tc group, suggesting a potential large impact of tcs on antibiotic use in the US.",PMC6023107,PMC6023107_1
The finding that children in the tc-exposed households had half the antibiotic prescriptions of children in non-tc-exposed houses could indicate the potential of tcs having a large impact on antibiotic use in the US.,PMC6023107,PMC6023107_2
"Maternal report of illness, particularly airway-related disease, has been shown to be highly valid.",PMC6023107,PMC6023107_3
"Had the authors chosen to consider only diagnoses observed by a healthcare provider, mild illnesses that were not brought to medical attention would have been missed.",PMC6023107,PMC6023107_4
"The authors found no evidence that “real-life” use of tc-containing wash products changed the occurrence of infectious disease in young children and their mothers, despite considerable exposure to tcs from other sources and the prevalence of viral infection.",PMC6023107,PMC6023107_5
The authors noted that regulatory removal of tcs from household wash products will make further investigation of tc effects on child health impracticable.,PMC6023107,PMC6023107_6
"The authors found that mothers in the tc group had higher urinary triclosan levels than those in the non-tc group, but babies in the tc group had lower antibiotic prescriptions than those in the non-tc group, suggesting a potential large impact of tcs on antibiotic use in the US.",PMC6023107,PMC6023107_7
The authors found that half of babies in the tc-exposed households received fewer prescriptions for courses of antibiotics than those in the non-tc-exposed houses.,PMC6023107,PMC6023107_8
