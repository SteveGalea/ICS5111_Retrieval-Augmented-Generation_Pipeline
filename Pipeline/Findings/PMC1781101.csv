The Genome Information Broker for Viruses (GIB-V) was constructed to fill the need for a comprehensive virus genome database. It includes all groups of viruses and is updated regularly with the release of the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDbJ) data. GIB-V provides access to information about individual virus genomes/segments through a web interface.,PMC1781101,PMC1781101_0
"GIB-V allows for the execution of BLAST searches for orf sequences of genomes/segments. The user can select from BLASTn, BLASTp, BLASTx, and TBLASTx search options.",PMC1781101,PMC1781101_1
GIB-V allows for keyword searches to find either viruses or orfs by combinations of multiple keywords up to 5 terms.,PMC1781101,PMC1781101_2
"GIB-V provides a download function for genome/segment data, which allows for the downloading of whole genome flat file, whole genome sequence, nucleotide sequences of all features, and amino acid sequences of the coding sequence (CDS) in flat file form.",PMC1781101,PMC1781101_3
"GIB-V allows for the comparison of multiple genomes/segments by reinforcing the cooperation between GIB-V and G-INFORBIO, a tool for genome data management and sequence analysis, to improve the smoothness of data communication between them and expand the genome comparison environment.",PMC1781101,PMC1781101_4
"GIB-V provides a blast search function that executes searches in two steps. The user selects a virus from the list on the ""Blast search-subject selection page"" and then selects a blast program and other options.",PMC1781101,PMC1781101_5
"GIB-V allows for the retrieval of orf information, which can be accessed from the search results. The retrieved orf can be displayed in nucleic acid or amino acid sequence in a text format.",PMC1781101,PMC1781101_6
"GIB-V provides a keyword search function that allows for finding either viruses or orfs by combinations of multiple keywords up to 5 terms. INSD accession number, virus name, country, note, isolate, segment, serotype, specific host, and strain are usable for virus searches, while DB_XREF, EC number, function, gene name, product name, protein ID, bound moiety (molecule/complex that may bind to the given feature), phenotype, location, and other qualifiers defined",PMC1781101,PMC1781101_7
