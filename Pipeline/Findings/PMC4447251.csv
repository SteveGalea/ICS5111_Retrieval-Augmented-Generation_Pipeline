"In a study investigating the role of the TLR4 signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, mice lacking the TLR4 gene (trif−/−) exhibited more severe lung dysfunction and pathology in response to SARS-CoV infection compared to wild-type mice. This was evidenced by increased weight loss, higher viral titers, and greater lung pathology in trif−/− mice, as well as persistent airflow limitation and elevated midtidal expiratory flow (EF50) in trif−/− mice compared to wild-type mice.",PMC4447251,PMC4447251_0
"In addition to the TLR4 pathway, the TRIF adaptor protein also plays a critical role in the host response to SARS-CoV infection. Trif−/− mice infected with SARS-CoV displayed similar lung dysfunction and pathology compared to TLR4-deficient mice (tlr4−/−).",PMC4447251,PMC4447251_1
"The study also found that trif−/− mice infected with SARS-CoV had aberrant chemokine signaling programs downstream of TLR4 compared to wild-type mice. The levels of chemokines ccl2, ccl3, ccl7, cxcl1, cxcl2, and cxcl3 were significantly higher in trif−/− mice infected with SARS-CoV compared to wild-type mice at days 2 and 4 postinfection.",PMC4447251,PMC4447251_2
"Whole-body plethysmography analysis revealed that both trif−/− and TLR4-deficient mice infected with SARS-CoV displayed signs of severe lung dysfunction, including airway resistance and obstruction, as well as persistently higher penh values and lower tpef/te ratios.",PMC4447251,PMC4447251_3
"Histopathology analysis of lung tissue sections from trif−/− and wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV showed increased accumulation of inflammatory cells surrounding the large airways, perivascular cuffing, and alveolar inflammation in trif−/− mice compared to wild-type mice. Additionally, increased thickening of the septa between alveoli and greater numbers of infil",PMC4447251,PMC4447251_4
