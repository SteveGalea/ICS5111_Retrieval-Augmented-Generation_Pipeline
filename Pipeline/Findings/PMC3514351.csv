The study found that the virulence of the Chinese highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strain rjxwn06 is significantly different from that of the prototype strain vr-2332. This was demonstrated through the analysis of gene expression profiles in tracheobronchial lymph nodes of pigs infected with either strain at a snapshot of 13 days post-infection.,PMC3514351,PMC3514351_0
"The study identified a significant number of differentially expressed genes between the two strains, which were mapped to genetic networks available in the ingenuity database. These networks were ranked based on the number of significantly expressed genes they contained and also listed diseases that were most significant.",PMC3514351,PMC3514351_1
"The study found that the expression of genes involved in the regulation of the immune system was significantly downregulated in pigs infected with the highly pathogenic strain rjxwn06, while the expression of genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell death was significantly upregulated.",PMC3514351,PMC3514351_2
The study also found that the highly pathogenic strain rjxwn06 caused more severe lesions in the lungs of infected pigs than the prototype strain vr-2332.,PMC3514351,PMC3514351_3
"The study utilized a computational pipeline comprised of gsnap for alignment and genome construction, and cufflinks to determine if differential expression and changes in transcript abundance were statistically significant. The pipeline also involved the use of cuffmerge to create a single transcript dataset from multiple reconstructions, and gene annotation using a mysql database matching to the Ensembl Sscrofa9.56 reference genome currently supported by the Integrative Genomics Viewer (Broad Institute).",PMC3514351,PMC3514351_4
