"In the context of network theory, this study highlights the importance of contact networks in the spread of infectious diseases. The findings suggest that structure and characteristics of contact networks can significantly affect the rate of transmission of mers disease.",PMC5964435,PMC5964435_0
"The study identifies patients with high degree of centrality as epidemic attenuators, as they are linked to many secondary cases that did not produce any further secondary cases of their own. Patients with high betweenness, on the other hand, are identified as epidemic amplifiers, as they are a pathway to infect other patients.",PMC5964435,PMC5964435_1
"The results show that healthcare facilities and healthcare workers are the most crucial factors in driving national epidemics of mers. Hospital infections display higher interconnectivity, and, on average, are linked to patients that are more connected to highly connected patients than nonhospital infections.",PMC5964435,PMC5964435_2
"The study emphasizes the importance of limiting access to other patients and quarantines, as most important nodes are found within hospitals, and healthcare workers are more prone to the infection. Reducing contact formation especially within hospitals by restricting hospital visitation for mers patient families and reducing the number of healthcare workers with access to mers patients will significantly affect the spread of mers disease.",PMC5964435,PMC5964435_3
"The findings also suggest that a high proportion of healthcare workers feel at risk of contracting the disease but are obliged to care for mers patients, as a high percentage of healthcare workers do not feel safe at work using standard precautions. In terms of the number of connected contacts, nodes 1664, 1025, 124, 133, and 897 were identified as critical in the spread of mers to other cases using the betweenness metric, and these patients acted as a bridge connecting other smaller secondary cases and thus the spread of mers infection by further connecting with other secondary cases who also connect other important cases.",PMC5964435,PMC5964435_4
