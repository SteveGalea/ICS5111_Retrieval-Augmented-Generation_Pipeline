"In this study, the authors investigated whether human viruses of distinct phylogenetic origins express common carbohydrate moieties. They used carbohydrate microarrays and elisa-based viral glycan-profiling analysis to characterize two broadly HIV-neutralizing agents, human monoclonal antibody 2G12 and lectin GNA.",PMC4633014,PMC4633014_0
"The authors found that 2G12 is strictly specific for high-density man9 clusters that decorate the HIV envelope spike, whereas GNA recognizes a number of N-glycan cryptic sugar moieties, including oligomannoses and previously unrecognized tri/m-gn-glyco-determinants.",PMC4633014,PMC4633014_1
"The authors noted that GNA appears to be the potent natural ligand of GNA and that molecular mechanisms underlying GNA-model of ""pauci reactive"" glycan-binding and broad virus neutralization warrant further investigation.",PMC4633014,PMC4633014_2
"The authors mentioned that owing to the potential immunogenic activity as a plant-derived lectin, GNA is unlikely suitable for anti-virus therapy in vivo, and effort must be made to establish GNA-like potent and broadly virus-neutralizing antibodies, especially humanized or fully human mAbs that are readily applicable in the front-line biodefense against emerging viral pathogens.",PMC4633014,PMC4633014_3
