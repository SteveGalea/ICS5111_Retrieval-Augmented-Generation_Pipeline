"The eav nsp7α protein, a subdomain of the arterivirus nsp7 protein, has a unique fold with no significant indicators of function or similarities in structure, as revealed by analysis using EBI web tools (PDBsum/Profunc; Dali; GRATH).",PMC3126611,PMC3126611_0
"Mutations in the eav nsp7α protein, selected based on structure and sequence alignment, affected some aspect of the eav replicative cycle, indicating that they are structurally or functionally important.",PMC3126611,PMC3126611_1
"The eav nsp7α protein, with a novel fold and essential for virus viability, is the most conserved region of nsp7 and is part of many replicase-processing intermediates, suggesting that these intermediates may perform specific functions themselves.",PMC3126611,PMC3126611_2
"The nsp7α protein, with a unique fold, is likely preserved in the full-length nsp7 protein and is not accompanied by a large conformational change in the context of the full-length protein.",PMC3126611,PMC3126611_3
"The nsp7α protein, with a unique fold and essential for virus viability, provides little clue about potential functions of nsp7α, as analysis of the nsp7α structure using EBI web tools did not result in any significant indicators of function or similarities in structure.",PMC3126611,PMC3126611_4
