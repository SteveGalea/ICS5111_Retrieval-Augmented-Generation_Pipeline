"In the context of multiple sclerosis, studies have linked the disease to exposure to certain microorganisms, particularly environmental factors, which can influence disease development through a cumulative lifetime exposure. The amount of epidemiological evidence reporting a strong association between multiple sclerosis and infection with specific pathogens, such as herpesvirus type 6, adenovirus, and human papillomavirus, is stronger for certain diseases than for others, such as lyme disease, where the evidence for a role for a particular pathogen is weak.",PMC2665673,PMC2665673_0
"In the context of multiple sclerosis, the major infectious models in mice, such as Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), cause a single major symptomatic episode, followed by clearance of the virus, although the virus persists in low amounts. In contrast, in the context of multiple sclerosis, tmev-induced demyelinating disease is caused by epitope spreading from viral determinants to self-myelin determinants.",PMC2665673,PMC2665673_1
"In the context of multiple sclerosis, chemokine receptor knock-out mice virtually abolished lesions of demyelination, whereas depletion of CD8+ T cells did not have that effect. Other studies in balb/c mice have shown that th1-type cytokines are involved in viral clearance but not demyelination.",PMC2665673,PMC2665673_2
"In the context of Guillain-Barré syndrome, in mice inoculated with Neurotropic strains of Semliki Forest Virus (SFV), lesions of demyelination are not seen in nude or SCID mice, demonstrating that it is t cell-mediated.",PMC2665673,PMC2665673_3
"In the context of Guillain-Barré syndrome, computer algorithms uncovered homology between an epitope in the SFV surface protein E2 and myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG)18-32. Mice primed with either peptide develop paralytic symptoms with histopathology resembling that of mice infected with SFV. The authors of that study concluded that the cross-reactive antibody response was mainly responsible for the demyelinating lesions.",PMC2665673,PMC2665673_4
