Mers-cov induces significantly higher secretion of type I interferons (IFNs) in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDSCs) compared to SARS-CoV.,PMC4403407,PMC4403407_0
"The onset of viral gene expression in human PDSCs is crucial for mers-cov entry into PDSCs via the endosomal route, and chloroquine-mediated inhibition of IFN production by PDSCs after contact with mers-cov argues for receptor-mediated endocytosis of viral particles and activation of mers-cov spike proteins by endosomal proteases, finally resulting in cytosolic entry of mers-cov across the endosomal membrane.",PMC4403407,PMC4403407_1
"Dpp4 is described as an activating receptor on T lymphocytes (T cells), but its function in dendritic cells (DCs) has thus far been linked only to T cell stimulation.",PMC4403407,PMC4403407_2
"The absence of functional entry receptors in mice leads to lack of IFN production in murine cells, and mers-cov-induced IFN secretion is strongly inhibited by blocking dpp4 with recombinant viral spike proteins.",PMC4403407,PMC4403407_3
"The release of type I and III IFNs may protect against mers-cov-induced pathogenicity, but clinically recorded mers patients having a worse prognosis than SARS patients, and the severity of illness correlates with large amounts of inflammatory cytokines in serum, suggesting immune-mediated pathogenesis being potentially one factor for the higher mortality rate observed in mers patients.",PMC4403407,PMC4403407_4
