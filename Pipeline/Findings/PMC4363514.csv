"The study identified two novel rhabdoviruses, ekv-1 and ekv-2, in individuals with unexplained febrile illnesses in central Africa.",PMC4363514,PMC4363514_0
"The viruses were most closely related to basv, a rhabdovirus previously identified in individuals with febrile illnesses in central Africa, and to tibv, a rhabdovirus previously identified in ticks in central Africa.",PMC4363514,PMC4363514_1
"The study found evidence for a significant enrichment of lasv, a rhabdovirus previously identified in individuals with febrile illnesses in central Africa, in individuals with unexplained febrile illnesses.",PMC4363514,PMC4363514_2
The study did not find evidence for significant enrichment of any other viruses in individuals with unexplained febrile illnesses.,PMC4363514,PMC4363514_3
"The study used a computational pipeline that included alignment and phylogenetic analysis of full-length polymerase, glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, and polymerase-associated proteins, as well as real-time quantitative pcr, to characterize the identified viruses.",PMC4363514,PMC4363514_4
"The study found evidence for widespread infection with rhabdoviruses in individuals with unexplained febrile illnesses in central Africa, suggesting that these viruses may have immunological and developmental consequences.",PMC4363514,PMC4363514_5
"The study identified a significant enrichment of lasv in individuals with febrile illnesses in central Africa, which may have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of these illnesses.",PMC4363514,PMC4363514_6
"The study also found evidence for widespread infection with rhabdoviruses, including basv and tibv, in individuals with febrile illnesses in central Africa, which may have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of these illnesses and for developing diagnostic tools for these viruses.",PMC4363514,PMC4363514_7
"The study emphasized the need for future studies to assess causality, especially through the thorough sampling of non-disease-affected controls, to realize the potential of next-generation sequencing (ngs) as a routine diagnostic tool.",PMC4363514,PMC4363514_8
"The study also highlighted the challenges of using ngs to identify causative agents of unexplained febrile illnesses, given the potential for widespread subclinical infection with rhabdoviruses in individuals in central",PMC4363514,PMC4363514_9
