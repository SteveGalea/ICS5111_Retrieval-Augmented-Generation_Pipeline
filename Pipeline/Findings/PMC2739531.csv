"The study demonstrates correlative expression of five high abundance serum apps, act, clu, hap, aat, and lrg, in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) at various stages of the disease using gel-based proteomics approach.",PMC2739531,PMC2739531_0
The study reveals an inverse correlation between the expression of clu and lrg with the progression of EOC.,PMC2739531,PMC2739531_1
"The study shows that the expression of hap, aat, and act in EOC patients is correlated with the initial three stages of the cancer.",PMC2739531,PMC2739531_2
"The study indicates that the expression of hapc and aatf, the cleaved fragments of hap and aat, is not correlated with the stages of EOC.",PMC2739531,PMC2739531_3
"The study suggests the potential prognostic significance of clu and lrg in EOC patients, as they were consistently elevated in EOC patients in the initial three stages of the cancer.",PMC2739531,PMC2739531_4
