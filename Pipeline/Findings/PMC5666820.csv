"The present study reports the largest number of complete genome sequences for mers-cov and sars-cov, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the viruses' origins and evolution.",PMC5666820,PMC5666820_0
"The study reveals that mers-cov, which emerged in the Middle East in 2012, is related to sars-cov, which caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, but is distinct from it.",PMC5666820,PMC5666820_1
"The analysis suggests that mers-cov has been circulating in dromedary populations in the Middle East and North Africa since at least 2012, with many independent, sporadic human cases.",PMC5666820,PMC5666820_2
"The study identifies a deep branch in the phylogenetic tree of mers-cov, suggesting that the virus has been endemic in dromedary populations in the Middle East and North Africa for several decades.",PMC5666820,PMC5666820_3
"The analysis suggests that the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of mers-cov is distinct from that of sars-cov, which may explain the milder clinical symptoms associated with mers-cov infections.",PMC5666820,PMC5666820_4
