"The study found that generalized linear modeling (glm) and classification and regression trees (cart) both performed well at predicting laboratory test results, with good agreement between the methods in predicting positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv).",PMC3986061,PMC3986061_0
"The study found that cart, a top-performing complementary approach, overcame glm's issue with missing values and was more computationally intensive but potentially less sensitive to simple algebraic relationships among features.",PMC3986061,PMC3986061_1
"The study found that glm generated rules for just 11 of 81 sendout tests and for just 3 of 170 in-house tests, while cart generated rules for 60 sendout tests and for over a dozen in-house tests.",PMC3986061,PMC3986061_2
"The study found that the main determinant for rules for in-house tests was a normal or abnormal result for the same test within the previous seven days, suggesting that repeat laboratory testing within one week does not always add information that could not have been anticipated from the previous result.",PMC3986061,PMC3986061_3
"The study found that rules with ppv and/or npv ≥ 0.95 were found for only two tests that are sendouts at the hospital, with a ppv of ≥ 0.95 in several cases and an npv of more typically 0.70–0.85.",PMC3986061,PMC3986061_4
"The study found that on average, simple rules yielded a ppv of 0.84 and an npv of 0.75, which means that on average, rules will correctly predict an abnormal laboratory result 5 times out of 6 (5/6 ≈ 0.84) and correctly predict a normal result 3 times out of 4.",PMC3986061,PMC3986061_5
"The study found that the information provided by these simple rules rarely replaces the information obtained from actually performing these tests, but that integration of information not considered in the present study, including vital signs, chief complaints, and physical findings, may improve prediction by these methods.",PMC3986061,PMC3986061_6
"The study found that the rules it found can inform clinical decision-makers, but that the information they provide rarely replaces the information obtained from actually performing these tests.",PMC3986061,PMC3986061_7
