"The m-pmv cytoplasmic tail undergoes an additional maturational cleavage step after virus particle release, which activates env fusion activity.",PMC1212599,PMC1212599_0
"Mutations in the cytoplasmic tail of the m-pmv env protein can modulate the fusogenicity of the tm protein, with six mutations nearly abrogating fusion activity and four mutations significantly increasing fusion activity.",PMC1212599,PMC1212599_1
"The q9 residue in the cytoplasmic tail of the m-pmv tm protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining an alpha-helical structure, which may be regulated by alpha-helical interactions in the cytoplasmic domain.",PMC1212599,PMC1212599_2
"The substitution of alanines for residues in the center of the predicted coiled-coil region (mutants k7a, q9a, and i10a) decreases the potential for coiled-coil formation and concomitantly decreases env-mediated fusion activity.",PMC1212599,PMC1212599_3
"The first 16 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain have the potential to interact in a coiled-coil with the same region of the other members of the env trimer, which could stabilize the trimer and restrict conformational changes in the ectodomain necessary for fusion to proceed.",PMC1212599,PMC1212599_4
