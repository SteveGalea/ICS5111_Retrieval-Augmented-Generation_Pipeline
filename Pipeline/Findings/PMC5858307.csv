"Findings: In a child with a chronic respiratory adenovirus (adv) infection, near-patient air sampling showed that despite high levels of adv dna in nasopharyngeal aspirates (npas), no clinically significant levels of adv were being aerosolised into the surrounding air in the presence of a tracheostomy. This was confirmed by the fact that all endotracheal tube aspirates (etas) were negative for adv dna. The use of a less sensitive routine diagnostic respiratory virus pcr assay for testing air samples may be deemed insufficiently sensitive for this purpose, but in this case, it allowed the staff to enter the room without the need to wear surgical masks and face visors, providing additional confidence to the clinical care teams that no clinically significant levels of adv were being aerosolised into the environment, which might potentially lead to nosocomial staff infections through direct inhalation or via self-inoculation from aerosol-contaminated fomites. 2. Findings: The use of a personal, portable, low volume sampler allowed for sampling by ward-based staff, physiotherapists, and education and play assistants, as well as during routine care duties, to check for the presence of airborne adv. This sampling showed that despite high npa adv dna levels at times, no adv dna was detected in any of the air samples. The use of a less sensitive routine diagnostic respiratory virus pcr assay for testing air samples may be deemed insufficiently sensitive for this purpose, but in this case, it allowed for the confirmation of no clinically significant levels of adv being aerosolised into the surrounding air, providing additional confidence to the clinical care teams that no clinically significant levels of adv were being aerosolised into the environment, which might potentially lead to nosocomial staff infections through direct inhalation or via self-inoculation from aerosol-contaminated fomites. 3.
