"This study demonstrates that tgev infection activates both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptotic pathways in infected cells, as evidenced by the combined inhibition of pan caspase and aif blocking apoptosis.",PMC6261820,PMC6261820_0
"The study shows that tgev-induced apoptosis involves the translocation of aif from the mitochondria to the nucleus, which is mediated by parp-1 and ros accumulation.",PMC6261820,PMC6261820_1
"The study indicates that parp-1 and ros play crucial roles in tgev-induced apoptosis, as parp-1 inhibition reduces aif translocation, and ros accumulation attenuates aif translocation.",PMC6261820,PMC6261820_2
"The study reveals that p53 mediates the transcription of aif and induces aif translocation to the nucleus, which may be mediated by p53 activation and ros accumulation.",PMC6261820,PMC6261820_3
"The study provides further insight into the mechanism of tgev-induced cell death, as it shows that tgev infection activates a caspase-independent cell death pathway mediated by aif, parp-1, and ros, in addition to the caspase-dependent pathway.",PMC6261820,PMC6261820_4
