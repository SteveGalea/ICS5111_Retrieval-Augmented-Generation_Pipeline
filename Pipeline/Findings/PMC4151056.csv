"Four monoclonal antibodies, 1c10, 2f10, 4g10, and 10e9, were generated and found to specifically recognize the messenger protein 1 (msg1) of Mycoplasma suis.",PMC4151056,PMC4151056_0
"Western blot analysis revealed that the antibodies 4g10 and 10e9 recognized the linear epitope i268kdgene274, while antibody 1c10 recognized the epitope d291thgsvf297, and antibody 2f10 recognized the epitope l251clki255.",PMC4151056,PMC4151056_1
"Epitope mapping using truncated fragments of msg1 expressed in E. Coli revealed that the epitopes i268kdgene274 and d291thgsvf297 were conserved among all M. Suis strain sequences available on NCBI, while the epitope l251clki255 was conserved in all M. Suis strains.",PMC4151056,PMC4151056_2
The study revealed that b cell epitopes on msg1 of M. Suis are continuous and one epitope was conserved among all M. Suis strain sequences available on NCBI.,PMC4151056,PMC4151056_3
The study contributed to a deeper understanding of the antigenic structure of the msg1 protein and facilitated the development of diagnostic methods for detecting M. Suis in blood and tissues.,PMC4151056,PMC4151056_4
