"According to the study in Anambra State, Nigeria, although 89.8% of health-care workers are aware of the disease surveillance (DSN) system, only 33.3%, 31.1%, and 33.7% of them know the specific uses of forms IDSR 001, IDSR 002, and IDSR 003, respectively. These findings suggest low depth of knowledge about the use of the individual IDSR forms, despite high awareness of the DSN system.",PMC3640243,PMC3640243_0
"The study also revealed that the knowledge of health-care workers about the use of the IDSR forms at the facility and local government area (LGA) levels is generally low, with only 22.4% of them correctly mentioning two diseases notified using the IDSR 003 form.",PMC3640243,PMC3640243_1
"The findings of the study showed that the common uses of DSN records at the facility level include detecting and notifying outbreaks of disease (25.4%), statistics and planning (28.9%), prevention and control of disease (32.5%), and changes in the trend of occurrence of disease (32.9%). At the LGA level, the common uses include purposes of record (14.0%), planning (45.6%), monitoring and evaluation of disease control measures (15.8%), and prevention and control of disease (22.8%).",PMC3640243,PMC3640243_2
"The study found that the IDSR 001 and IDSR 002 forms are predominantly found in primary health-care facilities, while the health-care facility records for forms IDSR 001 and IDSR 002 are less likely to be available in secondary health-care facilities (Ï‡2=7.67, p=0.005).",PMC3640243,PMC3640243_3
"The study also revealed that although 92.6% of health-care facilities had IDSR 001 forms, only 63.0% of the subjects were aware of the DSN system and had copies of the standard case definitions for notifiable diseases. This suggests that the presence of simple and standard case definitions is a prerequisite for an effective surveillance system, and the availability of these forms is a factor negatively affecting the functionality of the DSN system.",PMC3640243,PMC3640243_4
