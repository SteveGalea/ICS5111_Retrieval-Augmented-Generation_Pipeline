"The study produced and characterized mabs specific for bovine rotavirus (BRV) using purified viral particles as immunogen, which should aid in serotyping for selection of vaccine candidates and in the development of better diagnostic methods for detection of BRV.",PMC95862,PMC95862_0
"The study identified two mabs, 8B4 and 2B11, that were g6 subtype specific and could be used for typing of American and European strains of BRV.",PMC95862,PMC95862_1
"The study showed that the mabs produced by using synthetic peptide from VP7 as the immunogen for mab production were unable to detect antirotavirus antibodies as tested by ELISA, while mabs produced by using purified viral particles as the immunogen were successful.",PMC95862,PMC95862_2
"The study found that differences noted in the reactivity of each mab by the various tests, such as immunodot blotting, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and ELISA, could be due to differences in test sensitivity or to differences in protein conformation.",PMC95862,PMC95862_3
"The study showed that IHC (immunohistochemical) testing, which involves fixing tissues in formalin, was less sensitive than other methods, such as IF (immunofluorescence) and ELISA, because BRV epitopes were distorted by cross-linking induced during formalin fixation of the tissues.",PMC95862,PMC95862_4
