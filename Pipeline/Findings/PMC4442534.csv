"The viral metagenomics analysis of nasal secretions from animals with brd in bovine feedlots revealed a large number of different viruses, including bovine adenovirus 3, bovine rhinitis a virus (brav), bovine rhinitis b viruses (brbv), and a highly divergent influenza virus d (orthomyxoviridae family).",PMC4442534,PMC4442534_0
"The virus most commonly detected in nasal secretions was bovine adenovirus 3, which was strongly associated with brd (p < 0.0001).",PMC4442534,PMC4442534_1
"Related viruses, including influenza d virus, were previously described in Chinese cattle and a pig with influenza-like illness (43â€“45).",PMC4442534,PMC4442534_2
The cellular tropism of the highly divergent influenza virus d was wider than that of a human influenza c virus and was not inhibited at elevated temperatures.,PMC4442534,PMC4442534_3
"A viral metagenomics approach to characterize all viruses present, combined with real-time PCR testing of biological samples from well-matched brd cases and healthy controls, can provide a simple approach to the study of a complex infectious disease.",PMC4442534,PMC4442534_4
