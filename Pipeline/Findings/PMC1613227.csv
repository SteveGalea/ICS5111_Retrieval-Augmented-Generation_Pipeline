"In a study on the production of ha pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and measurement of neutralizing activity of immune serum, it was found that two-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated sera were tested in a microneutralization assay for the presence of antibodies that neutralized the infectivity of 100 td50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of 1918 (h1n1) viruses on mdck cell monolayers. This assay was performed for 14-16 days after infection, and after 2 days of infection, cells were fixed, and elisa was performed to detect the presence of viral nucleoprotein (np) and determine the neutralization activity.",PMC1613227,PMC1613227_0
"In the same study, the authors also found that for nonimmune ig treatment (control), an isotype-matched anti-human leukocyte antigen (sfr3-d5) monoclonal antibody was used, and igg from mice immunized with plasmid dna encoding haδcs (immune) or no insert (controls) was purified from sera by using a montage antibody purification kit (millipore, billerica, ma). The antibody titer was confirmed by elisa, and 0.3 ml of purified igg (from approximately 0.7 ml of serum) was administered i.v. Into each recipient naïve mouse (n = 10 per group) by tail vein injection 24 h before challenge.",PMC1613227,PMC1613227_1
"In a study on the production of ha pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and measurement of neutralizing activity of immune serum, the authors also reported that for the measurement of neutralizing activity, 100 μl of pseudoviruses at various dilutions were added to 293a cells (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a 96-well plate as described. After 2 days of incubation, cells were fixed, and elisa was performed to detect the presence of viral nucleoprotein (np) and determine the neutralization activity.",PMC1613227,PMC1613227_2
"In a study on vaccination, it was found that female Balb/c mice (6-8 weeks old; Jackson Laboratories, Bar",PMC1613227,PMC1613227_3
