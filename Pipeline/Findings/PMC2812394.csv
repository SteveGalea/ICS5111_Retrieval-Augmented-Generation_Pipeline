"Deletion mutants of TGEV n protein were designed based on predicted domain distribution, order-disorder pattern, and RNA-binding residues.",PMC2812394,PMC2812394_0
"Nucleic acid binding of n protein mutants was evaluated using northwestern blotting, showing that mutants lacking the C-terminal domain had reduced RNA binding, while mutants containing the central disorder domain had RNA binding activity similar to or greater than full-length n protein.",PMC2812394,PMC2812394_1
"In vitro template switching assay using a HIV-derived system revealed that TGEV n protein acts as an RNA chaperone, facilitating template switching.",PMC2812394,PMC2812394_2
"In vivo analysis using TGEV-derived replicons showed that n protein is required for efficient transcription, and the central disordered domain (aa 117 to 268) of n protein contains RNA chaperone activity.",PMC2812394,PMC2812394_3
"The RNA chaperone activity of TGEV n protein was located in its central disordered domain, and this activity requires RNA binding and additional characteristics present in the Î´n3 n-protein fragment.",PMC2812394,PMC2812394_4
