"Findings: In the section on ""Contingency Planning for Critical Care in Pandemic Influenza,"" the authors highlight that the next pandemic is expected to derive from the H5N1 strain, and based on epidemiological evidence to date, it suggests extremely high mortality and a significant risk to health care workers. They also mention that the expansion of ICU capacity to provide critical care to influenza patients may require the cancellation of elective surgery to minimize alternative sources of demand for critical care, upgrading level 2 facilities to level 3 facilities, and recruitment of theatre recovery areas and operating theatres.",PMC2206465,PMC2206465_0
"Findings: In the same section, the authors suggest that coherent incident response requires a robust command and control structure, with the ability to make rapid informed decisions across an organisation and across a health economy. They also mention that the common theme in both systems, i.e., the ""medallion"" structure in the UK and North American and Asian health institutions, allows application to a wide range of incidents while retaining familiarity gained from training and exercises.",PMC2206465,PMC2206465_1
"Findings: In the section on ""Critical Care Contingency Planning Guidance from the UK Department of Health,"" the authors place an expectation on providers to expand their level 3 bed capacity by a factor of 3 but no more. They also suggest that cancellation of elective surgery to minimize alternative sources of demand for critical care, upgrading level 2 facilities to level 3 facilities, and recruitment of theatre recovery areas and operating theatres may allow expansion of ICU-like care capacity.",PMC2206465,PMC2206465_2
"Findings: In the same section, the authors mention that staff in these areas already have the competencies to manage sedated patients and those receiving respiratory support, and their clinical role can be expanded with relatively limited focussed training.",PMC2206465,PMC2206465_3
"Findings: In the same section, the authors suggest that flexibility around dependency level and staff experience will be required, and cancellation of elective surgery to minimize alternative sources of demand for critical care, upgrading level 2 facilities to level 3 facilities, and recruitment of theatre recovery areas and operating theatres may allow expansion of ICU-like care capacity. They also mention that the expansion of ICU capacity to provide critical care in other areas will require the pre-emptive identification, tracing, and maintenance of all usable equipment and potentially the stockp",PMC2206465,PMC2206465_4
