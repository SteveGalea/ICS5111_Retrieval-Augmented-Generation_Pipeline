The study demonstrates that acquisition and enhancement of the cell-cell fusion activity by amino acid substitutions in the s protein are critical for interspecies adaptation and infectivity of ibv to cultured mammalian cells.,PMC2700284,PMC2700284_0
"The study shows that the l857-f mutation in the s2 region of the ibv s protein confers the s protein from non-fusogenic to fusogenic, and this mutation may affect one of the fusion steps and thus modify the fusion activity of s protein and syncytia formation.",PMC2700284,PMC2700284_1
"The study illustrates that acquisition and enhancement of virus-cell/cell-cell membrane fusion is a multistep process, and it involves binding of the s protein to one or more receptors, conformational changes of the protein to a fusion-active form, and the actual fusion process.",PMC2700284,PMC2700284_2
"The study demonstrates that further enhancement of the cell-cell fusion activity of ibv s protein was achieved by a single amino acid substitution (g405-d) in p65 virus, and this mutation, meanwhile, enhances the infectivity of the virus in cultured cells.",PMC2700284,PMC2700284_3
"The study proposes a model of two-step adaptation adaptation process of two-step adaptation of chicken embryo-adapted ibv to vero cells, and it divides early passages of vero-adapted ibv, including p7, p12, p14, and p20, belong to the primarily adapted group, and other cell culture-adapted strains, including the ck-adapted and beaudette-us strains cac39114 and cac39300, belong to the secondarily adapted group.",PMC2700284,PMC2700284_4
