"The neural network-based prediction method, NetCorona, developed by the authors for identifying potential cleavage sites of the SARS-3CLpro proteinase is publicly available through the link 'CBS prediction servers' from http://www.cbs.dtu.dk or at this specific URL: http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetCorona/.",PMC442122,PMC442122_0
"The authors identified 77 potential cleavage sites in seven full-length coronavirus genomes, including human coronavirus 229e, by aligning deduced polyprotein sequences and training a neural network classifier with three-fold cross-validation and Matthews correlation coefficients.",PMC442122,PMC442122_1
"The authors found that the method was highly specific, with a correlation coefficient of 0.84 on cross-validated test sets, and care was taken to ensure that all cleavage sites were equally distributed in every cross-validated set.",PMC442122,PMC442122_2
"The authors suggested that the method might facilitate proteinase blocking based drug discovery, as it allows the prediction of potential cleavage sites with an averaged sum of the score of all three networks arising from the three-fold cross-validation, where scores below 0.5 indicate non-cleavage and scores above 0.5 indicate potential cleavage.",PMC442122,PMC442122_3
"The authors noted that the method could be employed by researchers working with coronaviruses function, as it provides hints about proteinase affinity to various non-cleavable peptide ligands, and that it might be useful for researchers suspecting a possible viral proteinase cleavage but may also prove useful for researchers working with coronaviruses, as the authors identified 25 or 26 positive examples in every test set, which is combined values of the three test sets, each with an averaged sum of the score of all three networks arising from the three-fold cross-validation.",PMC442122,PMC442122_4
