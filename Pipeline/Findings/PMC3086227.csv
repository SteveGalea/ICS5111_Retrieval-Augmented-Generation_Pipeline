"A study in Japan found a novel betaherpesvirus, bat betaherpesvirus 2 (batbhv-2), in insectivorous bats.",PMC3086227,PMC3086227_0
"PCRs with consensus primers failed to detect batbhv-2, possibly due to minor mismatches between the sequences of batbhv-2 and the primer sets.",PMC3086227,PMC3086227_1
"RDV, a tool for identifying emerging viruses, was used to detect viral cdna fragments independent of virus species and found batbhv-2 in 4 of 50 spleen samples and in liver, kidneys, and lungs of two bats.",PMC3086227,PMC3086227_2
Blast search showed that the complete gb sequence of batbhv-2 was novel and most similar to that of tuhaiid herpesvirus 1.,PMC3086227,PMC3086227_3
"The prevalence of batbhv-2 in insectivorous bats was relatively high (8%) and was detected in a few parenchymal organs but not in serum, intestine, or urinary bladder samples, suggesting no apparent virus shedding by the bats.",PMC3086227,PMC3086227_4
