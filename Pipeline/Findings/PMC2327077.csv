"The mab tec-11, prepared after immunization of BALB/c mice with a recombinant protein containing the a2 domain of human ceacam1, reacts specifically with the a2 domain of ceacam1. Other cd66 antibodies tested in this system did not recognize the a2 domain, indicating that tec-11 is a unique mab for detecting ceacam1 isoforms with the a2 domain.",PMC2327077,PMC2327077_0
"Using a radioimmunoassay technique with polyclonal antibodies, Svenberg et al. found that serum levels of ceacam1 were elevated in patients with liver or biliary tract diseases. This study is the first to demonstrate that it is the 115 000 ceacam1(a2) isoform that is significantly increased in patients with a hepatobiliary system disease.",PMC2327077,PMC2327077_1
"The combined data from this study and a previous study in which a polyclonal antibody specific for the a2 domain of ceacam1 was used, indicate for the first time that it is the 115 000 ceacam1(a2) isoform that is lex-negative, and only a minor 160 000 isoform present in bile (but not in blood) is lex-positive.",PMC2327077,PMC2327077_2
"Ceacam1 expressed on granulocytes could be important for their homing to the areas of inflammation, and aggregation of surface ceacam1 with antibodies has been found to mediate signal transduction. These findings could be affected by soluble ceacam1 in body fluids.",PMC2327077,PMC2327077_3
"Previous studies have established that ceacam1 is a major carrier of the carbohydrate epitope lex, and lex was also present on glycoconjugates in the pa-resistant fraction of serum and bile. The origin of the 160 000 lex-positive ceacam1(a2) in bile ought to be determined. The function of ceacam1 in body fluids as well as in granulocytes, lymphocytes, and some other normal and tumour cells is not completely understood, but some of these could",PMC2327077,PMC2327077_4
