The study found that hantavirus-infected patients have significantly decreased levels of interferon-λ (IFN-λ) in their serum during hantavirus fever-related syndrome (HFRS) compared to healthy individuals. This is the first time any form of IFN has been found at decreased levels in circulation during an acute virus infection in humans.,PMC1951347,PMC1951347_0
"The study showed that IFN-λ has antiviral effects against hantaviruses, making it the first time any member within the Bunyaviridae family has been shown to be sensitive to IFN-λ in vitro.",PMC1951347,PMC1951347_1
The study found that an established hantavirus infection is insensitive not only to type I IFNs but also to type II and III IFNs and that systemically elevated levels of IFNs are lacking in patients. This suggests that the IFN responses are inhibited and unable to stop the infection during HFRS and HCSP.,PMC1951347,PMC1951347_2
The study showed that cells infected with hantavirus produce less NO when stimulated with IFN-γ and that STAT1 phosphorylation after IFN-γ treatment is inhibited. This suggests that hantavirus-infected cells are insensitive to IFN-γ-induced antiviral responses.,PMC1951347,PMC1951347_3
"The study found that hantavirus-specific cytotoxic T (CTL) responses taking place in HCSP and HFRS patients are independent of IFNs, and the observed lack of lymphopenia might explain the high concentration of CD8+ T cells specific for single epitopes detected in hantavirus-infected patients. This suggests that the CTL response is not dependent on IFN-induced clearance of virus from infected cells.",PMC1951347,PMC1951347_4
