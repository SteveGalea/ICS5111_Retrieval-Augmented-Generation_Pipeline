"The current study found that severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus viremia level is related to disease severity, with significantly higher levels in deceased patients compared to survivors.",PMC3962368,PMC3962368_0
"SFTS infection causes tissue injury and organ damage, which can lead to elevated serum enzymatic markers and death. ALT, AST, LDH, and CK were all elevated above the normal range especially during the acute phase of infection, and their peak levels in deceased patients were significantly higher than in survivors.",PMC3962368,PMC3962368_1
"The study found that three subsets of T cells (CD69+, HLA-DR+, and CTLA4+) were elevated in SFTS-infected patients, but their changes happened at different phases of progression of the disease. CD69+ T cells (both CD8+ and CD4+) were elevated during the acute phase of infection with significant activation in deceased patients compared to survivors at time points of the peak viremia. HLA-DR+ (a mHC class II cell surface receptor) and CTLA4+ (a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily on the surface of helper T cells) T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+) were elevated during the recovery phase in survivors.",PMC3962368,PMC3962368_2
"Both pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and IFN-γ) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10) were elevated in SFTS-infected patients, and levels were dramatically higher in deceased patients, which is similar to reports by other groups. IL-6 and IL-10 were persistently elevated in deceased patients while levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α, and IL-17A were similar to normal healthy donors.",PMC3962368,PMC3962368_3
"The study found that viral load, PLT, and key serum enzymes were measured concurrently over the critical acute phase of SFTS after infection, and no further analysis to relate these dynamic changes to the severity and course of the disease was reported in previous studies. The findings on the involvement of CD69+ as well as HLA-DR+ and CTLA4+ T cells",PMC3962368,PMC3962368_4
