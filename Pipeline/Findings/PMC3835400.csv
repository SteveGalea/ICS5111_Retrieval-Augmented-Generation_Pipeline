"Honeybee venom (gv) and electrical stimulation (esv) contain different sets of proteins, with gv venom containing proteins involved in immune response, stress response, and metabolism, while esv venom contains proteins involved in metabolism, stress response, and signal transduction.",PMC3835400,PMC3835400_0
"Phosphopeptide enrichment using immobilized metal affinity column (imac) ti4+-imac material and shotgun analysis identified proteins with phosphorylation sites, and proteins with post-translational modifications such as carbamidomethylation and oxidation were also detected.",PMC3835400,PMC3835400_1
"Protein abundance in gv and esv venoms were quantified using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1-de), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de), and shotgun analysis, with gv venom showing higher abundance of proteins involved in immune response, while esv venom showed higher abundance of proteins involved in metabolism.",PMC3835400,PMC3835400_2
"Proteins with differential abundance between gv and esv venoms were identified using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1-de) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de), with esv venom containing proteins involved in metabolism with higher abundance compared to gv venom.",PMC3835400,PMC3835400_3
"Protein identification and quantitation in honeybee venom manually extracted from venom gland (gv) and electrical stimulation (esv) were also performed using shotgun analysis, with phosphopeptide enrichment using immobilized metal affinity column (imac) ti4+-imac material used for phosphopeptide enrichment and shotgun analysis identified proteins with phosphorylation sites.",PMC3835400,PMC3835400_4
