"Rhesus macaques were successfully vaccinated against avian influenza (AIV) using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vectors expressing AIV hemagglutinin (HA) proteins, with all animals developing high neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers against homologous and heterologous AIVs after boosting.",PMC3126271,PMC3126271_0
"VSV vectors expressing a more recent AIV strain, VN/1203, elicited a more robust cross-nAb response against heterologous AIVs than those expressing a 1997 strain, HK/156.",PMC3126271,PMC3126271_1
"VSV vectors expressing VN/1203 HA protein, although expressed at lower levels than the HK/156 HA protein, elicited stronger cross-nAb titers against heterologous AIVs than those expressing the HK/5 HA protein.",PMC3126271,PMC3126271_2
"VSV vectors expressing VN/1203 HA protein were able to induce nAbs against two clade 0 viruses, HK/156 and HK/483, after priming alone in 80-100% of the animals, while VSV HK/156 vaccine did not induce cross-clade nAbs after priming.",PMC3126271,PMC3126271_3
"The VSV-based AIV vaccines were able to induce a robust nAb response against homologous and heterologous AIV strains in all of the macaques after boosting, with many of the currently approved human AIV vaccines inducing immune responses predictive of protection in only 40-70% of individuals.",PMC3126271,PMC3126271_4
