This study found a high concordance between four different assays (two elisa and two neutralization assays) for categorization of Ebola virus (EBOV) survivors (candidate EBOV convalescent plasma donors) by anti-EBOV antibody status. The authors suggest that these tests could be used to screen donors to provide additional high-titer EBOV convalescent plasma in future trials.,PMC6927845,PMC6927845_0
"This study identified participants with predicted high mortality based on virologic, clinical laboratory, and clinical criteria, with 7% to 15% of EBOV survivors who planned to donate convalescent plasma being negative by four tests for anti-EBOV antibody.",PMC6927845,PMC6927845_1
This study showed that 7% to 15% of EBOV survivors who planned to donate convalescent plasma were negative by four tests for anti-EBOV antibody.,PMC6927845,PMC6927845_2
"This study suggested that repetitive administration of antibody in the form of convalescent whole blood or serum from humans did not enhance survival of nonhuman primates challenged with EBOV, which routinely leads to death 8 to 9 days after exposure.",PMC6927845,PMC6927845_3
This study showed that a temporally related decline in plasma EBOV load following treatment with EBOV convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody observed in this study supports previous observations and justifies further evaluation of this intervention.,PMC6927845,PMC6927845_4
"This study identified opportunities for enhancement to protocol design that could inform future trials of EBOV convalescent plasma, such as selecting EBOV convalescent plasma donors with high anti-EBOV titers, using a larger dose volume of EBOV convalescent plasma, administering at least three repeated doses of EBOV convalescent plasma unless contraindicated, and frequent sampling for viral load in both controls and EBOV convalescent plasma-treated participants.",PMC6927845,PMC6927845_5
