"Bat coronaviruses (betacoronaviruses and alphacoronaviruses) have different circulation and transmission dynamics in bat populations. Betacoronaviruses, which are most associated with emerging human infectious diseases, have been found in rhinolophus spp. Bats from other species in Africa and Asia show far greater genetic distance to betacoronaviruses than those from rhinolophus spp. This is especially true for viruses from Africa, which share less than 83% full genomic identities with betacoronaviruses.",PMC4054348,PMC4054348_0
"The host range of sars-like coronaviruses (covs) is restricted mainly to rhinolophus spp. But with wide geographic locations. In the present study, sars-like coronaviruses were detected only in 2 of 14 bats in Baoshan, and this sample size was too small to permit detection of alphacoronaviruses, but betacoronaviruses were not found in 254 bats from the other three locations, which supports the conclusion that there is a restricted distribution of betacoronaviruses in the bat population.",PMC4054348,PMC4054348_1
"The gene encoding spike protein S is the highly variable region within the cov genome. The rbm of sars covs is a unique element that initiates viral infection by specifically binding to the ACE2 receptor of human and civet cells. Two critical amino acid residues on rbm (479N and 487T) determine the efficiency of receptor binding since substitution of both abolishes viral binding to human ACE2, thereby abrogating the viral infection. Substitution of either residue alone, however, has no significant impact on human ACE2 binding.",PMC4054348,PMC4054348_2
"Lyra11, together with rs3367, is a gap-filling virus and likely has the ability to directly infect humans. This discovery provides an important clue to the origin of sars cov from bat sars-like covs and presents the strongest evidence so far that bats are the natural hosts of sars covs.",PMC4054348,PMC4054348_3
"Due to their unique mechanism of viral RNA replication, covs are prone to recombination during double infections. Previous studies have suggested that",PMC4054348,PMC4054348_4
