"The study successfully established five m. myotis cell lines derived from neural and immune related tissues, which displayed varying susceptibility to infection by lyssaviruses.",PMC4190323,PMC4190323_0
"The study confirmed the presence of viral sensors tlr3, rig-1, and mda5 in these cell lines, indicating their capacity to sense a broad range of RNA viruses, including lyssaviruses.",PMC4190323,PMC4190323_1
"The study demonstrated a varying susceptibility to rabv infection in different m. myotis cell lines, with the brain derived cell line mmbr displaying high expressions of ifn induced genes, suggesting a microglia-like feature of mmbr in the CNS.",PMC4190323,PMC4190323_2
The study revealed that the ability to control the pathogenic rabv replication via the IFN system in the CNS contributes to the asymptomatic outcome in bats.,PMC4190323,PMC4190323_3
"The study provided a preliminary insight into the antiviral innate immunity correlated to CNS against neurotropic viruses infection in bats, using the established immortalized cell lines from the European bat M. Myotis, displaying a variable susceptibility to different lyssaviruses.",PMC4190323,PMC4190323_4
