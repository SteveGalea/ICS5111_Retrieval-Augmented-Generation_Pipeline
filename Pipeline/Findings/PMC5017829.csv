"Complications: Mumps, a viral disease caused by the mumps virus, can lead to several complications, including orchitis in post-pubertal males, which occurs in 15-40% of cases. Orchitis can result in subfertility, testicular atrophy, and testicular tumors in rare cases. Mumps infection during early pregnancy has been linked to spontaneous abortion in some studies.",PMC5017829,PMC5017829_0
"Transmission and Personal Protective Equipment: Mumps is a moderately to highly contagious viral disease that is transmitted via direct contact, droplet transmission, and through spread from contaminated fomites. Patients are most contagious at 1 to 2 days prior to symptom onset. Isolation measures should include standard as well as droplet precautions.",PMC5017829,PMC5017829_1
"Prevention: The primary method of preventing mumps infection is via vaccination. Currently, vaccination recommendations are for a two-dose vaccination series for all children with the MMR vaccine. Patients with serious neurologic and other severe complications, advanced malignancies, advanced HIV disease, or severe febrile illnesses should not receive the MMR vaccine. Isolation and use of respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette are also recommended prevention methods.",PMC5017829,PMC5017829_2
"Treatment: Mumps is typically a self-limiting viral disease, and treatment is primarily supportive, including antipyretics and analgesics. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed due to difficulty distinguishing mumps orchitis from bacterial infection and to prevent superimposed bacterial infection.",PMC5017829,PMC5017829_3
"Differential Diagnosis: The differential diagnosis for mumps orchitis includes bacterial infection and testicular torsion. Non-infectious causes for parotid swelling include drugs, malnutrition, tumors, cysts, salivary stones, metabolic disorders, and rare disorders such as Mikulicz’s, Parinaud’s, and Sjögren’s syndromes.",PMC5017829,PMC5017829_4
