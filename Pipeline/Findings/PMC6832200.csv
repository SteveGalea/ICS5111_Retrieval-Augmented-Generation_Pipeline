"The recent development of more efficient culture systems for hepacivirus (HCV) has enabled the isolation and propagation of HCV in cell culture systems, providing a platform for studying HCV biology and pathogenesis.",PMC6832200,PMC6832200_0
"HCV is a small, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects hepatocytes. It is transmitted through contact with infected persons or exposure to contaminated environments.",PMC6832200,PMC6832200_1
"HCV has two distinct virion types: naked and quasi-enveloped particles. The presence of a quasi-envelope, which is derived from lipid rafts, provides the virus with a means of egress from infected cells and aids in its transmission through contact with infected persons or exposure to contaminated environments.",PMC6832200,PMC6832200_2
"Naked hepacivirus virions are less efficient at cell entry than quasi-enveloped hepacivirus virions, and their attachment to target cells is less specific. This may provide an explanation for the detection of hepacivus beyond the liver.",PMC6832200,PMC6832200_3
"Quasi-enveloped hepacivirus virions use a different mechanism for cell entry than naked hepacivus virions, and the viral membrane is degraded in lysosomes by a process that requires niemann-pick disease type C1 and lysosomal acid lipase. Identifying the cellular receptor for both virion types will be key to elucidating their entry mechanisms.",PMC6832200,PMC6832200_4
