The study constructed a surface-expression recombinant L. lactis nz9000 expressing the porcine rotavirus VP4 protein as a potential oral vaccine against porcine rotavirus infection initiated at mucosal surfaces.,PMC2896853,PMC2896853_0
"The study found that the use of L. lactis as an expression vector for the rotavirus VP4 surface antigen was safe and effective following oral vaccination in mice, as oral immunization elicited specific cellular and humoral immunity, including anti-VP4 siga, which is important for the development of a potential oral vaccine against porcine rotavirus infection initiated at mucosal surfaces.",PMC2896853,PMC2896853_1
"The study found that mucosal antibody secretory IgA (sIgA) was detected in feces, vaginal, and ophthalmic washes following oral vaccination in mice, indicating that VP4-expressed recombinant L. lactis is able to elicit both local and systemic mucosal immune responses, which is important for the development of a potential oral vaccine against porcine rotavirus infection initiated at mucosal surfaces.",PMC2896853,PMC2896853_2
"The study found that serial dilutions of antisera of mice immunized orally with the VP4-expressed recombinant L. lactis were mixed with an equal volume of a virus-serum mixture, and cytopathicity was strongly inhibited by the addition of the antiserum of mice immunized with the VP4-expressed recombinant L. lactis in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the protective antigen-specific antibody responses in sera from the mice immunized orally were generated by the neutralization assay in ma104 cells infected with porcine rotavirus, which is important in the control of infections initiated at mucosal surfaces.",PMC2896853,PMC2896853_3
"The study found that splenic cells from the VP4-expressed recombinant L. lactis group significantly increased following specific stimulation with purified VP4 protein compared to the proliferation of spleen cells harvested from control mice, indicating that specific cellular immune responses were induced following VP4-expressed recombinant L. lactis administration.",PMC2896853,PMC2896853_4
