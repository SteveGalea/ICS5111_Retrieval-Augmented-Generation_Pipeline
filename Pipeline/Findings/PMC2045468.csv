"Cathepsin B, a lysosomal protease, cleaves a specific site in the envelope subunit SU of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virion, which enhances viral-dna synthesis and infection.",PMC2045468,PMC2045468_0
"Cathepsin B is involved in an HIV-1 envelope-dependent step of infection, as demonstrated by the following findings: (i) HIV-1 infection of cathepsin B knockout mouse embryonic cells (MECs) is less efficient than that of wild-type MECS; (ii) exogenous cathepsin B overcomes the inhibition of HIV-1 infection by MECS caused by the weak base inhibitor ca-074methyl ester (ME); and (iii) ca-074m, a derivative of ME that selectively inhibits cathepsin B in the range of 1 to 10 μM, but is less specific and inhibits other cathepsins at 50 to 100 μM, causes a dose-dependent decrease in HIV-1 infection of MECs.",PMC2045468,PMC2045468_1
"Cathepsin B cleaves the SU subunit of HIV-1 envelope into specific fragments, but does not digest the tm glycoprotein or the capsid protein.",PMC2045468,PMC2045468_2
"The prominent 28-kDa cleavage product of SU uniquely resists further degradation at higher concentrations of cathepsin B, and its apparent molecular mass is similar to that of the receptor-binding domain (rbd) of SU.",PMC2045468,PMC2045468_3
"HIV-1 infection is not inhibited by weak bases, such as ca-074methyl ester, which selectively inhibit cathepsin B at concentrations of 5 μM or less, but is inhibited by broad-spectrum cathepsin inhibitors, such as E-64d, which inhibit other cathepsins at concentrations of 50 to 100 μM or more.",PMC2045468,PMC2045468_4
"HIV-1 infection of cathepsin B knockout mouse embryonic cells (MECs) is less efficient than that of wild-type MECS, indicating a moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) env-specific role",PMC2045468,PMC2045468_5
