"The nucleocapsid proteins of several enveloped RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, arteriviruses, flaviviruses, and paramyxoviruses, possess nuclear localization signals (NLS) and transiently localize into the nucleus or nucleolus during the viral life cycle.",PMC4451415,PMC4451415_0
"The nuclear localization of nucleocapsid protein of enveloped RNA viruses supports viral proliferation by interfering with the host's immune response or other mechanisms, including maintaining the balance of nucleocapsid protein:rNA molecules for optimal production of the functional viral genome.",PMC4451415,PMC4451415_1
"Targeting the nuclear export of these proteins presents an opportunity for the development of small molecule inhibitors or live-attenuated vaccine candidates, as inhibition of their nuclear localization could negatively impact on the production of infectious viral particles and cell-to-cell spread.",PMC4451415,PMC4451415_2
"The nuclear localization of nucleocapsid protein also presents an opportunity for the development of attenuated vaccine candidates, as mutations that disable the nuclear/nucleolar localization function, without hampering the cytoplasmic function of nucleocapsid proteins, could result in viruses that replicate, albeit to lesser degree due to reduced ability to inhibit antiviral responses.",PMC4451415,PMC4451415_3
"The nuclear localization of nucleocapsid protein of enveloped RNA viruses has potential as a target for the development of live-attenuated vaccines or antiviral drugs, as inhibition of its nuclear localization could negatively impact on the production of infectious viral particles and cell-to-cell spread.",PMC4451415,PMC4451415_4
