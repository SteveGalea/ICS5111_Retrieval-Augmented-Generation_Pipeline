"Ebola virus (EBOV) enters host cells via binding of its glycoprotein (GP) to cellular receptors, primarily Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and TIM-4 (TIMD4), and is internalized via macropinocytosis pathway. However, the exact pathways involved in different cell lines and the unidentified proteins or receptors involved in unincorporated entry methods remain unclear.",PMC5589696,PMC5589696_0
"In uncoating and fusion, GP1 binds endosomes via its receptor-binding domain (RBD) and GP2 guides fusion via its fusion loop. The exact structural details and molecular mechanisms of EBOV RNP (nucleocapsid, VP30, VP35, L, RNA) complexes and the driving force directing VP35 to release RNA from RNP are not fully defined.",PMC5589696,PMC5589696_1
"In replication, VP35 releases RNA from RNP by inhibiting NPC1-induced oligomerization, but the unidentified enzymes triggering and accelerating this process, as well as the molecular mechanism by which VP35 peptide releases RNA from RNP, remain unclear.",PMC5589696,PMC5589696_2
"In assembly and budding, GP2 antagonizes the anchoring of tetherin via unarticulated mechanisms, and VP40 regulates viral budding by associating with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane with unknown detailed mechanisms. The exact mechanisms by which GP antagonizes tetherin and how VP40 associates with the inner leaflet are not clear.",PMC5589696,PMC5589696_3
"Intracellular viral particles may serve as a source of infectious units that can be delivered by exosomes combined with another signal-dependent process upon cell-to-cell contact, but the cell-to-cell contact is supposed to promote EBOV GP-mediated infection, and increase the local concentration of retroviral pseudovirions and EBOV VLPs (Virus-like particles). However, the exact role of exosomes in the EBOV lifecycle is still limited, and further investigation is required.",PMC5589696,PMC5589696_4
