"In the context of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, a survey conducted in the United States found that people's anxiety about swine flu and the preventative actions they took to avoid infection declined as the perceived gravity of the novel outbreak waned. Both of these distributions showed a marked bimodality, with a large proportion of respondents indicating a higher subjective risk and more protective actions taken than the majority. The results of the model for the protection index suggest that respondents' deployment of protective behavior is mediated by their subjective anxiety level, controlling for demographic, epidemiological, and geographic variables.",PMC2779851,PMC2779851_0
