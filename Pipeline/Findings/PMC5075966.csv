"The study revealed that p2x7r is involved in cii-induced atp release from dcs, and its activation enhances the release of extracellular atp and intensifies stimulation of atp, which in turn enhances the expression of p2x7r.",PMC5075966,PMC5075966_0
"The study found that cii-induced p2x7r activation promotes the differentiation of th17 cells via its pro-inflammatory role, and its inhibition attenuated cii-induced joint damage of cia mice.",PMC5075966,PMC5075966_1
"The study demonstrated that p2x7r signaling facilitates the development of the cii-induced differentiation of th17 cells, and its inhibition attenuated cii-induced increase in il-17a in vivo and in vitro.",PMC5075966,PMC5075966_2
"The study showed that the mrnas levels of rorγt and rorα, essential for th17 cell differentiation, were profoundly elevated following the stimulation of p2x7r by cii.",PMC5075966,PMC5075966_3
The study revealed that p2x7r is a necessary component for the cii-induced differentiation of th17 cells in both in vivo and in vitro.,PMC5075966,PMC5075966_4
