A reliable unbiased lipidomic approach was established and utilized to characterize changes in host lipidomic profiles upon infection with enteroviruses EV-A71 and CV-A16.,PMC6928875,PMC6928875_0
"The study found that infection with either EV-A71 or CV-A16 resulted in significant upregulation of arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid, which are precursors of bioactive lipid mediators, such as resolvins, protectins, and maresins, that have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-infective properties.",PMC6928875,PMC6928875_1
"The study also identified significant downregulation of several phosphatidylcholine species, which are key components of cell membranes, upon infection with either EV-A71 or CV-A16.",PMC6928875,PMC6928875_2
The study's findings provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of enterovirus infections and suggest potential host-targeting antiviral strategies based on the modulation of lipid mediator signaling pathways.,PMC6928875,PMC6928875_3
"The study's lipidomic approach, which involved the use of a high-resolution mass spectrometry platform and a large panel of internal standards, enabled the identification and quantification of over 1,100 lipid species, providing a comprehensive characterization of the host lipidomic profile changes upon infection with EV-A71 and CV-A16.",PMC6928875,PMC6928875_4
