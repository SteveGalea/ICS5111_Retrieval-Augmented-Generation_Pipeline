"The study reports a high prevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in dromedary camels in Israel, with 68.6% of the samples testing positive.",PMC6518832,PMC6518832_0
"The study also found that Bedouins, a population group with lower socioeconomic status, had significantly higher HEV seropositivity rates compared to non-Bedouin Arabs and Jews in Israel.",PMC6518832,PMC6518832_1
"The study suggests that HEV is endemic in Israel, with high seropositivity rates observed in Bedouins and non-Bedouin Arabs, and medium and low rates observed in Jews in Israel.",PMC6518832,PMC6518832_2
"The study found that exposure to HEV is associated with age, with higher seropositivity rates observed in older age groups.",PMC6518832,PMC6518832_3
The study highlights the need for further studies to determine the specific HEV genotypes circulating among dromedary camels and local Arab populations in Israel.,PMC6518832,PMC6518832_4
