"In a study on the pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated diseases, mice were infected with EBV to reproduce EBV-associated diseases in humanized mice. EBV is implicated in a variety of diseases, including Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). One study reproduced the symptoms of RA in humanized mice, suggesting a search for lesions and symptoms of other autoimmune diseases in EBV-infected humanized mice.",PMC4235711,PMC4235711_0
"The study also found that EBV infection is usually asymptomatic, and symptoms of im appear only after long incubation periods of 3-7 weeks. This makes it extremely difficult to find individuals currently having acute primary EBV infection in a period suitable for analysis of innate immune responses.",PMC4235711,PMC4235711_1
"The study found that critical early steps in EBV infection take place in oropharyngeal epithelial cells and lymphoid tissues just adjacent the epithelium. Since no human epithelial cells are present in humanized mice, this suggests that replication in epithelial cells is an essential step in primary EBV infection.",PMC4235711,PMC4235711_2
"The study also found that EBV is transmitted orally via saliva, and oral inoculation of EBV to humanized mice has not been successful. This makes it highly desirable to reproduce this natural route of transmission in humanized mice.",PMC4235711,PMC4235711_3
"Another finding was that innate immune responses to EBV can be revealed in humanized mice, although the study did not analyze early events following infection. One study using nod/scid mice with human fetal thymus xenograft focused on innate immune responses to EBV and found a role for EBV-induced CD8+ NKT cells in the suppression of tumorigenesis by EBV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.",PMC4235711,PMC4235711_4
Improving humanized mouse models is also being pursued to overcome various limitations in the current models. Engraftment of human cells has been improved by introducing human SIRPÎ± trans,PMC4235711,PMC4235711_5
