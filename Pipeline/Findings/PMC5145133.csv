"In the context of the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, a study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that the majority of new Ebola virus infections occurred in households and that the virus spread quickly through these households, indicating a need for targeted interventions in these settings.",PMC5145133,PMC5145133_0
"The study also found that the serial interval, the average number of secondary cases produced by a primary case, was higher than previously estimated, suggesting that Ebola virus transmission is more efficient than previously thought.",PMC5145133,PMC5145133_1
"In the context of the 2013-2015 Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that the risk of Ebola virus transmission was higher in areas with higher population density, emphasizing the importance of considering population density in epidemic control efforts.",PMC5145133,PMC5145133_2
"The study also identified several factors associated with a higher risk of Ebola virus transmission, including a higher proportion of households with multiple Ebola virus cases, a higher proportion of Ebola virus cases in households with more than one room, and a higher proportion of households with a history of Ebola virus transmission.",PMC5145133,PMC5145133_3
