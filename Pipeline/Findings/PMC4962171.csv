The study highlights the importance of adaptive renovation strategies for reusing vacant buildings as a way to minimize environmental impacts and to provide energy-efficient solutions. It also emphasizes the need for a systematic and innovative approach that integrates financial and non-financial performance measures in light of organizational strategy (balanced scorecard).,PMC4962171,PMC4962171_0
"The study shows that the proposed system for current condition assessment and restoration actions is superior to the results obtained from the project decided by hospital managers, not only in terms of budget utilization but also of quality improvement.",PMC4962171,PMC4962171_1
"The study suggests that the proposed system, although developed for hospital managers who are non-experts in architecture/engineering/construction fields, provides managers with great flexibility to clarify, modify, and customize the assessment criteria and renovation strategies to apply to different building types.",PMC4962171,PMC4962171_2
"The study indicates that the proposed system, while paying more attention to environmental sustainability issues, renovation actions resulted from functionally spatial adjustment were not considered, and only general specification of materials, resources, and equipment for hospital buildings were included in the system.",PMC4962171,PMC4962171_3
"The study suggests that future efforts to examine the feasibility of the proposed system on different building projects are highly recommended, as it will provide managers with a more integrated decision support system, while expanding the system's practical or specific data modules and interfaces to establish a more integrated decision support system.",PMC4962171,PMC4962171_4
