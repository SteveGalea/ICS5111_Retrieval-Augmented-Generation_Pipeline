"The current hepatitis A outbreak in Korea highlights the need for fundamental changes and advancements in the public health system in the country. This is due to the country's low level of immunity in the adult population, high population density, and increased risks of outbreaks of new types of infectious diseases or healthcare-related infection, resulting from factors such as close contact in schools and workplaces, high healthcare services utilization, cultural habits of eating out with company, and shellfish aquafarming.",PMC6883026,PMC6883026_0
"To prevent hepatitis A outbreaks, three basic policies can be implemented: eliminating infectious agents by identifying and isolating hepatitis A patients who are the source of viral spread, blocking the spread of infection by removing or disinfecting contaminated water, food, and tools used in daily life by susceptible individuals, and increasing immunity among people at risk of infection.",PMC6883026,PMC6883026_1
"Natural immunity, acquired through infection at a young age, is currently difficult to acquire in Korea due to the country's low incidence of hepatitis A. As a result, large-scale vaccination is a cost-effective measure in countries, such as Korea, with a high incidence of hepatitis A, as many people tend to be infected when they are young, and even lower in urban areas.",PMC6883026,PMC6883026_2
"The immunity levels are relatively low among Koreans born in the 1970s to 1990s and even lower in urban areas, resulting in a high hepatitis A fatality rate in future outbreaks. Therefore, a long-term plan of five years or more is required for organizations such as public health centers to provide adult vaccines at a lower cost than that of private hospitals to provide an alternative for those who are not vaccinated due to cost.",PMC6883026,PMC6883026_3
"The introduction of timely infant vaccination should be considered to improve herd immunity in certain age groups, and a vaccination registration record system may be needed to provide adequate measures for effective control of hepatitis A outbreaks. The establishment and implementation of a long-term plan of five years or more can help overcome hurdles such as securing budgets, vaccine supply, and low vaccination rates.",PMC6883026,PMC6883026_4
