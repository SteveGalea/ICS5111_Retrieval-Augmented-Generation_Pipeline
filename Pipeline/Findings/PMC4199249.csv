"In children with acute respiratory illness, multiplex PCR is a more sensitive diagnostic tool for confirming respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) than rapid antigen testing. However, in cases where rapid antigen testing is negative, multiplex PCR should be considered to rule out superinfection with other respiratory viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV).",PMC4199249,PMC4199249_0
"Persistent nucleic acids of respiratory viruses, such as Bocavirus, Adenovirus, and Rhinovirus, can be confirmed in respiratory specimens, even in asymptomatic children. However, the clinical significance of these findings is unclear, as high concentrations of viral nucleic acids in respiratory specimens are associated with symptoms.",PMC4199249,PMC4199249_1
"RSV is the most common respiratory pathogen, accounting for 55% of respiratory tract infections in children. Antibiotic usage was not significantly reduced in a study that used PCR diagnostics for 17 different pathogens in children with respiratory tract symptoms.",PMC4199249,PMC4199249_2
"PCR diagnostics for multiplex respiratory viral testing can provide information about virus concentration, which is important, especially in small children, as they contract multiple infections in one winter season, some of which will have a short latency period between episodes of illness.",PMC4199249,PMC4199249_3
"The confirmation of RSV, hMPV, and PIV in children with respiratory tract symptoms did not show any reduction in antibiotic consumption or costs in a study that used PCR diagnostics for respiratory viral testing. However, the study dates back to 2005, and the costs of PCR diagnostics have been notably reduced since then.",PMC4199249,PMC4199249_4
