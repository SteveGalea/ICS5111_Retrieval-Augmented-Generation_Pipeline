"Case report: A previously healthy 41-year-old female developed herpes simplex virus (HSV) hepatitis leading to fulminant liver failure and death. Antemortem diagnosis was difficult, but liver biopsy confirmed extensive hepatocyte necrosis with characteristic cowdry type A inclusions. Aggressive treatment with acyclovir was not initiated until later stages of the disease.",PMC4010022,PMC4010022_0
"Discussion: HSV hepatitis is rare, accounting for only 1% of all acute liver failure cases and 2% of all viral causes of acute liver failure. It occurs most commonly in immunocompromised individuals but can affect immunocompetent patients. Nonspecific flu-like symptoms, including fever, myalgias, and abdominal pain, are common, but only 30-50% of patients show characteristic herpetic skin lesions. Antemortem diagnosis is challenging, but liver biopsy is the gold standard for confirmation. Acyclovir treatment should be considered early in the course of the disease, as outcomes improve with earlier initiation.",PMC4010022,PMC4010022_1
"Case report: The patient presented with a 3-week history of feeling generally unwell, with severe myalgias, chills, and a fever two days earlier. Antemortem laboratory investigations showed acute renal failure, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The patient developed fulminant liver failure with a severe lactic acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, requiring intubation.",PMC4010022,PMC4010022_2
"Discussion: HSV hepatitis leads to anicteric hepatitis, characterized by a significant increase in transaminases (100-1000 fold) with a relatively normal or low bilirubin. Antemortem diagnosis is challenging, but viral serology cultures, viral PCR testing, and liver biopsy can aid in confirmation. Acyclovir treatment should be considered early in the course of the disease, as outcomes improve with earlier initiation.",PMC4010022,PMC4010022_3
"Case report: The patient's cause of death was determined to be HSV viral hepatitis, causing fulminant liver failure. HSV was identified in her liver tissue through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing",PMC4010022,PMC4010022_4
