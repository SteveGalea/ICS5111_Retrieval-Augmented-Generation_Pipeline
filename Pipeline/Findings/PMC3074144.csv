"The yeast non-sense codon (NSC) readthrough (NTR) pathway, which is essential for the proper expression of genes containing premature termination codons, can be activated by changes in the efficiency of readthrough events or by changes in the efficiency of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) events.",PMC3074144,PMC3074144_0
"NTR and NMD events can differentially affect mRNA abundance and stability, and can be used to post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression.",PMC3074144,PMC3074144_1
"The programmed NTR database reveals that high efficiency NTR events are widespread, but changes in efficiency do not correlate with mRNA stability.",PMC3074144,PMC3074144_2
"The programmed NMD database reveals that NMD events can decrease mRNA abundance, but changes in efficiency do not correlate with mRNA stability.",PMC3074144,PMC3074144_3
The yeast NTR and NMD pathways can differentially affect mRNA stability in a context-specific manner.,PMC3074144,PMC3074144_4
