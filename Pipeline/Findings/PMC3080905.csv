"Radionuclide imaging using 18F-labeled acyclovir, a drug inhibiting viral replication in herpes simplex virus, has been successful in visualizing experimental herpes simplex virus infections in tumors and could potentially be used to identify the distribution of influenza virus in the respiratory tract of patients with influenza, unless their distribution would essentially localize nonspecifically to areas of increased perfusion, as has been observed for radiolabeled ciprofloxacin in experimental bacterial infections.",PMC3080905,PMC3080905_0
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now being used to track the development of pulmonary lesions and characterize inflammatory responses in murine models of bacterial infection. Advances in pulmonary MRI and MRI-compatible cell labeling are providing a unique opportunity for these studies, as inflammatory cells loaded ex vivo with antiviral drugs or nanoparticles have been demonstrated to localize to sites of infection.",PMC3080905,PMC3080905_1
"Bioluminescence imaging (BLI), because it uses relatively inexpensive detection equipment and does not involve radioactivity, is the molecular imaging method most accessible to bench researchers. It has been used to visualize viral replication in small animals, such as mice, with organs of interest within a few millimeters of the skin surface.",PMC3080905,PMC3080905_2
"MRI is particularly useful for studying inflammatory processes, because dark (hypointense) regions much larger than the particles themselves, rendering them visible even when only a few cells are labeled. Although promising for identifying areas of inflammation in solid organs, such as the brain, these methods may prove to be less useful for studying respiratory tract infections, because dark areas of diminished signal intensity at sites of spio particle uptake may resemble normal lung.",PMC3080905,PMC3080905_3
"MRI can help to supplement or even replace some traditional research methods in which data on viral replication could only be obtained by infecting a large number of mice, sacrificing cohorts at various time points, collecting tissue samples, and determining viral titers. BLI can also be used to study host responses to infection, by creating reporter mice, in which a luciferase gene is inserted into the animal's genome under the control of a promoter of interest.",PMC3080905,PMC3080905_4
