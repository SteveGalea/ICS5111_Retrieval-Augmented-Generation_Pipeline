"Differences in host responses: Through computational analysis of gene expression changes, it was found that infection with MERS-CoV strain Eng 1 induced early kinetic changes, between 3 and 12 hours post infection, compared to infection with strain Sa 1. Robust transcriptional changes distinguished the two strains predominantly at the late time points, with differential expression of innate immune and pro-inflammatory responsive genes as a result of IFN, TNF, and IL-1α signaling.",PMC4522970,PMC4522970_0
"Topological differences: Comparative transcriptional analysis using topological techniques, such as persistence homology and filtered clustering, revealed topological differences in the kinetics and magnitude of the host response to MERS-CoV Sa 1 and Eng 1, with differential expression of genes involved in extracellular remodeling following Eng 1 infection and differential pro-inflammatory responses.",PMC4522970,PMC4522970_1
Viral protein differences: The predicted activation for STAT3 mediating gene expression relevant for epithelial cell-to-cell adherens and junction signaling in Eng 1 infection suggests that these transcriptional differences may be the result of amino acid differences in viral proteins known to modulate innate immunity during MERS-CoV infection.,PMC4522970,PMC4522970_2
"Cytokine-stimulated transcriptomics: Combining statistical analysis of infection and cytokine-stimulated Calu-3 transcriptomics, it was identified that Eng 1 infection upregulated extracellular remodeling genes, while differential pro-inflammatory responses were observed.",PMC4522970,PMC4522970_3
"Innate immune and pro-inflammatory responses: Differential expression of genes involved in innate immune and pro-inflammatory responsive genes as a result of IFN, TNF, and IL-1α signaling was observed following infection with MERS-CoV Sa 1 and Eng 1, with these differences predominantly observed at late time points.",PMC4522970,PMC4522970_4
