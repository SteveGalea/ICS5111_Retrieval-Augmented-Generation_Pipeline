"In a review of 70 studies on human bocavirus (HBoV) published between 2005 and 2016, the majority (66) reported on HBoV prevalence in detection, with a low heterogeneity among the studies. The prevalence of HBoV in children less than 5 years of age was higher than in older children and adults. HBoV1 was detected in all studies, and the highest prevalence (13%) was observed in individuals suffering from diarrhea with and without respiratory tract infection in Africa.",PMC6157109,PMC6157109_0
"The review revealed that most studies focused on HBoV in respiratory tract infection, with a prevalence rate of 78% in individuals suffering from respiratory tract infection being higher than the rate (21%) in individuals suffering from gastroenteritis. This could be due to the fact that most studies focused on HBoV in respiratory tract infection since its discovery in 2005.",PMC6157109,PMC6157109_1
"The review also found that the prevalence of HBoV in children less than 5 years of age was higher than in older children and adults, indicating that these children may act as reservoir for other emerging epidemic HBoV strains.",PMC6157109,PMC6157109_2
"The review highlighted that while studies in Africa were mostly done in urban settings, this could be due to the lack of laboratory resource capacity and technology for HBoV detection in rural settings. Therefore, more studies are required in Africa, especially in rural settings, to monitor the prevalence of HBoV and help understand the role of HBoV in individuals suffering from gastroenteritis with/without respiratory tract infection.",PMC6157109,PMC6157109_3
"The review also suggested that the high frequency of HBoV in children raises a potential health risk, as these children may act as reservoir for other emerging epidemic HBoV strains. This underscores the need for increased awareness and surveillance of HBoV infections, particularly in children in Africa, where the virus is likely to be underreported due to the costs of testing for the virus.",PMC6157109,PMC6157109_4
