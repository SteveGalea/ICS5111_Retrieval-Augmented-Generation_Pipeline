"The interaction between the stem-loop structure and the pseudoknot stem, specifically base triple interactions, is crucial for frameshifting efficiency. Deletion or mutation of these triple interactions leads to a significant decrease in frameshifting activity, both in vitro and in vivo.",PMC2995055,PMC2995055_0
"The length and composition of loop L2 also play a significant role in frameshifting efficiency. Adjustment of the length or composition can lead to a significant decrease in frameshifting activity, both in vitro and in vivo.",PMC2995055,PMC2995055_1
"The presence of a hairpin structure instead of a pseudoknot structure can increase frameshifting efficiency, particularly during heavy ribosomal traffic.",PMC2995055,PMC2995055_2
"The stability and kinetics of pseudoknot folding may also affect frameshifting efficiency, particularly during heavy ribosomal traffic. Slow-folding pseudoknots can limit frameshifting efficiency, and the efficiency may not solely be dictated by the stability of the pseudoknot but also by its kinetic properties.",PMC2995055,PMC2995055_3
"The role of stem-loop interactions in frameshifting efficiency suggests that frameshifting is not solely determined by the stability of the pseudoknot structure but also by its kinetic properties, such as mechanical resistance to rna unfolding and folding kinetics.",PMC2995055,PMC2995055_4
