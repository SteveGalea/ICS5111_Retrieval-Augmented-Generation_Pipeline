"The replication complexes of ns proteins assemble at the plasma membrane directed by the binding peptide of nsp1. Only a portion of the correctly assembled complexes are internalized via the endosomal pathway, while the remaining ns proteins distribute to the cytoplasm or nucleus.",PMC114878,PMC114878_0
"Spherules, which are the units of rna replication, containing a set of all ns proteins and 42s rna minus-strand template, can assemble at the plasma membrane or at internal membranes rich in anionic phospholipids, possibly at endosomes.",PMC114878,PMC114878_1
"The circulation of spherules occurs via the endosomal pathway, with the successfully assembled replication complexes inducing the formation of spherules.",PMC114878,PMC114878_2
"The half-life of replication complexes localized in the early endosomes is extremely short, as indicated by the inability to colocalize them with early endosomal markers.",PMC114878,PMC114878_3
"Late in infection, more and more cpv become enriched in the perinuclear region, possibly as a cellular response to viral insult, and may still be active in rna synthesis, as suggested by em autoradiography.",PMC114878,PMC114878_4
