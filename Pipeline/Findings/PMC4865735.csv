The study identified an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (efebll-1) in bat genomes derived from an ancient negative-strand RNA virus (bornaviral-like virus).,PMC4865735,PMC4865735_0
"Efebll-1 was found to be homologous to the polymerase gene of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in humans, and its sequence was conserved in bats from different genera (Miniopterus, Eidolon, and Rhinolophus).",PMC4865735,PMC4865735_1
"The study showed that efebll-1 was expressed in various tissues and cell types in bats, indicating its potential role in bat biology.",PMC4865735,PMC4865735_2
"The study also found that the efebll-1 gene was integrated into the genomes of bats, suggesting a possible mechanism for the horizontal transfer of RNA viruses.",PMC4865735,PMC4865735_3
"The study estimated the dN/dS ratio at each branch of the phylogenetic tree for efebll-1 and esebll-1, suggesting natural selection operating on these genes after the divergence of E. Fuscus and E. Serotinus.",PMC4865735,PMC4865735_4
