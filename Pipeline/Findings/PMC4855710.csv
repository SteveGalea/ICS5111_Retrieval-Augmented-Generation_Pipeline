The cotton rat is a new world rodent species with a history as an experimental animal model due to its unique susceptibility to human viruses.,PMC4855710,PMC4855710_0
Wild cotton rats are associated with a large variety of known or potentially zoonotic pathogens.,PMC4855710,PMC4855710_1
A method for isolating and culturing airway epithelial cell lines from bats was applied to generate rodent airway and renal epithelial cell lines from the cotton rat.,PMC4855710,PMC4855710_2
The newly established cell lines from the cotton rat can serve as host-specific in vitro models for viral infection experiments and for virus isolation and investigation of virus-host interactions.,PMC4855710,PMC4855710_3
"High-titre viral replication was observed for Rift Valley fever virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus in these cell lines, while no viral replication was observed for novel arthropod-derived members of the bunya-, rhabdo-, and mesoniviridae families.",PMC4855710,PMC4855710_4
