A study on the effect of 5 and 8 cm h2o peep levels on respiratory function in patients after heart surgery found that both levels improved pulmonary compliance and reduced the incidence of atelectasis.,PMC6108254,PMC6108254_0
"A clinical trial on non-hypoxic patients connected to mechanical ventilation with normal chest x-ray found that the use of peep levels of 0, 5, or 8 cm h2o had no effect on the incidence of atelectasis.",PMC6108254,PMC6108254_1
"A study on the effect of peep on respiratory function after heart surgery in three groups (0, 5, or 10 cm h2o peep) found that the levels of 5 to 8 cm h2o peep improved hypoxia and reduced the incidence rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the patients.",PMC6108254,PMC6108254_2
A study on patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery found that the use of peep levels over 10 cm h2o peep increased ventilation duration.,PMC6108254,PMC6108254_3
The present study found that the use of 10 cm h2o peep as a preventive measure had a significant impact in decreasing the incidence of atelectasis and reducing the duration of intubation in the ICU in the early period after heart surgery.,PMC6108254,PMC6108254_4
