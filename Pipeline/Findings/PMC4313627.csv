"During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, border screening was unsuccessful due to low sensitivity and a substantial proportion of infectious persons not being detected.",PMC4313627,PMC4313627_0
"Influenza virus causes explosive outbreaks despite its relatively low infectivity, and screening sensitivity is low, resulting in a substantial proportion of infectious persons not being detected at the border.",PMC4313627,PMC4313627_1
"Modeling studies suggest that border screening would not significantly delay the commencement of an epidemic or reduce the total number of cases, as allowing only a small number of cases to enter would result in an epidemic of the same size as if travel restrictions were not in place.",PMC4313627,PMC4313627_2
"Communication with incoming travelers, such as informational videos, posters, and health alert notices, can be a useful mechanism to encourage self-reporting and early identification of case-patients.",PMC4313627,PMC4313627_3
"During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, communication measures at borders, such as health alert notices (t-hans), provided a small positive influence on health care-seeking behavior among incoming travelers. However, the effectiveness of communication measures at borders is limited, and more effective disease control measures in the community, such as early isolation and quarantine of contacts, should be the focus of resource allocation.",PMC4313627,PMC4313627_4
