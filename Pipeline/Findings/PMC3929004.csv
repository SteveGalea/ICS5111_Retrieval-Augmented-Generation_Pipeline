"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are defined as those that have increased in incidence within the past two decades or have the potential to do so in the near future, due to the spread of a new agent, recognition of an infection previously undetected, or realization that an established disease has an infectious origin.",PMC3929004,PMC3929004_0
"Zoonotic EIDs are a major concern, as over 60% of known human pathogens are transmitted to humans from animals, and 73% of emerging infections are zoonotic. The majority of established strictly human pathogens also have zoonotic origins and have fully adapted to humans over many millennia of human and pathogen evolution.",PMC3929004,PMC3929004_1
"The human-animal interface presents a risk for EID emergence, as almost all now-established strictly human pathogens have zoonotic origins.",PMC3929004,PMC3929004_2
"The human environmental and interpopulation interactions have undergone profound and distinct transitions throughout history, leading to changes in the local pathogen spectrum and the spread of EIDs. The current transition, characterized by globalization, urbanization, and climate change, is reshaping the relations between humans and microbes.",PMC3929004,PMC3929004_3
"The species jump that initiates a first human infection by a new agent is often brought about by cultural, social, behavioral, or technological change, and the subsequent spread of the infection depends on various biological, social, and environmental drivers of EID emergence.",PMC3929004,PMC3929004_4
