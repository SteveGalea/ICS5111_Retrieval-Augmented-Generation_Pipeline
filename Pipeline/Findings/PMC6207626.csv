"The study identified novel bat and rodent pestiviruses in different species across several Chinese regions, revealing that these two mammals serve as natural hosts for pestiviruses.",PMC6207626,PMC6207626_0
"The newly identified bat and rodent pestiviruses potentially represented six new species under the genus Pestivirus, with hosts for bat pestiviruses (bpvs) found only in southern China and hosts for rodent pestiviruses (rpvs) found in northern, central, and western China.",PMC6207626,PMC6207626_1
"The close relationship between appv and bpvs indicates the presence of a much closer common ancestor of appv in bats than in other swine pestiviruses, suggesting that these viruses may have evolved independently in pigs and bats, forming at least three sub-lineages under the bat-swine lineage.",PMC6207626,PMC6207626_2
"The study revealed that these viruses potentially represented six new species under the genus Pestivirus, with different genome sizes and structures, and minimal sequence similarities when compared to other Pestiviruses, suggesting that these viruses may have evolved independently in pigs and bats, eventually forming at least three sub-lineages under the bat-swine lineage.",PMC6207626,PMC6207626_3
"The study suggested that these viruses may have evolved independently in pigs and bats, forming at least three sub-lineages under the bat-swine lineage, given that pestiviruses can cross species barriers to infect a wide range of artiodactylous animals.",PMC6207626,PMC6207626_4
