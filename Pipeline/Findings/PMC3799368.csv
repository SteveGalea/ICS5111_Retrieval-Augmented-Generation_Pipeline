"Mers-cov, the novel coronavirus causing severe respiratory disease in humans, primarily affects the epithelium of the lower respiratory tract in a transient manner in rhesus macaques.",PMC3799368,PMC3799368_0
The tropism of mers-cov for the lower respiratory tract explains both the severity of the disease observed in humans and the limited number of cases of human-to-human transmission to date.,PMC3799368,PMC3799368_1
Mers-cov replication is most prominent in type I and II pneumocytes in the alveoli of the lower respiratory tract.,PMC3799368,PMC3799368_2
"The self-limiting nature of mers-cov infection in rhesus macaques is displayed at various levels, including virus shedding, viral loads in tissues, neutrophilia, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, regulation of host gene expression, and production of cytokines, with correlation of gene-expression dynamics between pulmonary macrophages and lung tissue samples.",PMC3799368,PMC3799368_3
