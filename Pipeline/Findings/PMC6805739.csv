"A study conducted in Guinea found that while some participants strongly supported quarantine measures, 18% believed that quarantine should never be used, even in cases of highly contagious and lethal diseases. This finding echoes similar diversity among commentators in other contexts, such as in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and the US, as well as in Canada.",PMC6805739,PMC6805739_0
"The study also found that most participants (66%) believed that quarantine was justified if three criteria were met: the infected individuals were really contagious, the disease was lethal, and those in quarantine were provided with support services. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies in Canada and Taiwan, and reflects Upshur's ethical framework for the justification of quarantine measures.",PMC6805739,PMC6805739_1
"The study found that providing support services to quarantined communities was crucial in ensuring compliance, as demonstrated by the high voluntary compliance with quarantine measures during the 2003 SARS epidemics in Taiwan, China, and Canada. However, providing support services in low-resource contexts, such as in West Africa, may be challenging due to poor infrastructures, severe deficiencies in logistical and transport systems, and lack of investment in needed supplies.",PMC6805739,PMC6805739_2
"The study also found that while the vast majority of respondents did not reject quarantine in an absolute manner, the opposition to quarantine can also be explained by more general doubts about the effectiveness and optimal use of social distancing measures.",PMC6805739,PMC6805739_3
"The study found that beliefs and social attributes associated with socio-demographic variables, such as gender, age, and religion, influenced the perception of quarantine. However, it is uncertain whether these beliefs and social attributes underlay respondents' position, and future studies using qualitative methods are needed to understand the respondents' justifications.",PMC6805739,PMC6805739_4
