"Alt, a major indoor environmental allergen, enhances respiratory viral infection and exacerbates asthma through multiple mechanisms.",PMC4068913,PMC4068913_0
Alt-induced proinflammatory cytokine production is mediated by separate fungal proteases that are responsible for the enhancement of virus-induced cytokine productions by alt.,PMC4068913,PMC4068913_1
Alt-induced ifn production is repressed by a protease-independent mechanism.,PMC4068913,PMC4068913_2
Alt-induced repression of ifn production may represent an adapted response by fungus to survive the attacks from the host defense system.,PMC4068913,PMC4068913_3
The degree to which alt coexists with respiratory viral infection and the effect of persistent exposure to alt on epithelial antiviral immunity are unclear.,PMC4068913,PMC4068913_4
"Alt exposure affects virus-induced immunity in an imbalanced manner, with significant enhancement of proinflammatory cytokine production and severe repression of ifn production.",PMC4068913,PMC4068913_5
Future studies are needed to understand the interaction between alt and respiratory viral infection at different stages of the fungal life cycle and to determine how alt-induced repression of ifn production may contribute to the development and exacerbation of asthma.,PMC4068913,PMC4068913_6
The present data have to be interpreted with caution due to the use of alternaria filtrates instead of live fungi and the unclear degree of coexistence between alt and respiratory viral infection in the human airway.,PMC4068913,PMC4068913_7
Further studies in the areas of epidemiology and/or molecular biology are warranted to test the hypotheses that persistent exposure to alt may permanently alter the epithelial antiviral immunity and that the fungal life cycle has different phases with different immune responses.,PMC4068913,PMC4068913_8
"The present study is the first attempt to understand the interaction between the two pathogens, alt and respiratory viral infection, that are critical to the asthma pathogenesis.",PMC4068913,PMC4068913_9
