"The SARS virus, caused by SARS-CoV, impairs multiple organs, leading to respiratory distress and decreased immune function, causing patient death.",PMC1190220,PMC1190220_0
"SARS-CoV encodes a protein, 3b, with unknown functions, which is nuclear-localized and interferes with cell cycle regulation.",PMC1190220,PMC1190220_1
Overexpression of 3b protein in transfected cells leads to cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and induction of apoptosis.,PMC1190220,PMC1190220_2
"The role of 3b protein in inducing cell cycle arrest is conserved in different cell types, while apoptosis induction is cell-type specific.",PMC1190220,PMC1190220_3
"Massive necrosis and increased apoptosis cells are found in SARS patients, with apoptosis cells identified in lung, spleen, liver, and lymph nodes, including pneumocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes.",PMC1190220,PMC1190220_4
