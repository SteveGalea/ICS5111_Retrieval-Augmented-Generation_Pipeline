"The study found that veov infection in astrocytes leads to a delay in the cell cycle, primarily at the G0/G1 phase, due to a block in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking caused by the viral capsid binding to host cell import and export proteins.",PMC6315117,PMC6315117_0
"The study found that veov infection results in decreased expression of cyclins and CDKs, which are necessary for progression through the cell cycle, leading to cell cycle delay.",PMC6315117,PMC6315117_1
"The study found that veov infection in astrocytes leads to decreased expression of cyclin D1, which is necessary for entry into G1, and RB phosphorylation, which is regulated by cyclin E2 and CDK2.",PMC6315117,PMC6315117_2
The study found that veov infection in astrocytes leads to a decrease in cyclin E and A expression at both the mRNA and protein levels.,PMC6315117,PMC6315117_3
"The study found that veov infection in astrocytes results in decreased expression of cyclin D1 protein levels, but not mRNA expression, and that a block in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking may be influencing the expression of transcription factors, cell cycle regulators, and/or mitotic assembly factors affected following veov infection.",PMC6315117,PMC6315117_4
