"The study developed a yeast-based system for identifying and screening inhibitors against topoi, a general target for potential growth inhibitors that can be used as effective compounds for combined use with breast cancer chemotherapy drugs, such as camptothecin, which are topoi inhibitors. This system offers a competitive and low-cost strategy for potential growth inhibitor screening that can be used in low-resource laboratory settings while still enabling a high-throughput screening process.",PMC6522884,PMC6522884_0
"The study established a yeast-based system for identifying and screening inhibitors against coronavirus n7-mmtase II, which can be achieved using a multidrug-sensitive derivative of the δnce103 strain expressing a low level of hcaii II.",PMC6522884,PMC6522884_1
"The study created a fully automated anti-parasitic drug-screening yeast system, which allows for multiple parasite targets to be assessed simultaneously due to the expression of different fluorescent proteins in the yeast strain.",PMC6522884,PMC6522884_2
"The study developed a yeast-based system for detecting selective oestrogen receptor modulators and selective androgen receptor (ar) modulators, which used s. cerevisiae transformed with β-galactosidase genes, and the reporter expression was driven by human ar and response elements, in order to identify compounds that altered the reporter gene induction by testosterone.",PMC6522884,PMC6522884_3
"The study established a yeast-based detection system for evaluating the androgenic activity of endocrine disruptors from pulp and paper mill effluents, which used s. cerevisiae transformed with β-galactosidase genes, and the reporter expression was driven by human ar and response elements, in order to identify compounds that altered the reporter gene induction by testosterone.",PMC6522884,PMC6522884_4
