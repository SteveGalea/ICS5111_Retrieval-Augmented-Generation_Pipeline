"In a study involving rats with polycystic kidney disease, the use of body condition scoring (bcs) to assess animal health was found to be more sensitive than using weight alone.",PMC2846001,PMC2846001_0
The study showed that bcs accurately reflects the health status of both male and female rats with polycystic kidney disease.,PMC2846001,PMC2846001_1
"The study found that rats with polycystic kidney disease initially developed fat deposition over their pelvic bones before fat deposition over their lumbar vertebrae, which led to a modification in the bcs scale to better reflect this delay.",PMC2846001,PMC2846001_2
"The study showed that rats with polycystic kidney disease had increased levels of bun and creatinine in their blood, which were correlated with their body condition scores.",PMC2846001,PMC2846001_3
"The study found that female rats with polycystic kidney disease were less likely to develop obesity than male rats, but that the majority of them remained at a normal body condition score.",PMC2846001,PMC2846001_4
