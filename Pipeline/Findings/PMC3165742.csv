"The study presents a large-scale evaluation of promoter sequence-function heterogeneity in innate immunity using a live cell-based reporter system. It includes functional relationships of over 110 sequence variations in sensing different interferon (IFN) response triggers, including type I IFN, dsRNA, and DNA and RNA viruses.",PMC3165742,PMC3165742_0
"The study identifies strong and selective IFN-responsive elements, such as the parp10 sequence, which is highly inducible by IFN-α and -γ and also by the Newcastle disease virus.",PMC3165742,PMC3165742_1
The study demonstrates that the heterogeneity and context sequence of the ISRE and VRE sequences influence the temporal strength and selectivity of the responses of the reporter system toward the activator.,PMC3165742,PMC3165742_2
"The study shows that the use of GFP as the reporter, compared to other reporters, such as luciferase, gives further flexibility by allowing monitoring at different time points, i.e., without experimental termination or cell lysis.",PMC3165742,PMC3165742_3
"The study offers a simplified approach to generating resource data for finding biomarker tools for monitoring virus and interferon activity, and their responses, in disease and drug evaluation settings.",PMC3165742,PMC3165742_4
