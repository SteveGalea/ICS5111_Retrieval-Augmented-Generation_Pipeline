The systematic review and meta-analysis by Chertow et al. (2013) identified 286 inpatient studies from 117 countries and territories that reported isolation of a pathogen in a stool sample taken from a child with severe diarrhea.,PMC3762858,PMC3762858_0
"The study found that rotavirus is the leading cause of hospitalization due to diarrheal diseases in children under 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries, followed by norovirus, shigella, and ETEC.",PMC3762858,PMC3762858_1
"The study also found that children under 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries have a high burden of disease due to enteric pathogens, with diarrheal diseases causing more than half of all acute lower respiratory infections and more than 90% of all acute watery diarrheal diseases.",PMC3762858,PMC3762858_2
"The study highlighted the need for further research to address the gap in knowledge regarding the causes of diarrheal deaths in children under 5 years of age, as previous estimates were based on different methods and assumptions.",PMC3762858,PMC3762858_3
"The study also emphasized the need for further research to address the problem of mixed infections, where multiple enteric pathogens are identified in a stool sample taken from a child with severe diarrhea, and to develop methods to attribute the cause of a diarrheal episode to one enteropathogen in cases of mixed infections.",PMC3762858,PMC3762858_4
