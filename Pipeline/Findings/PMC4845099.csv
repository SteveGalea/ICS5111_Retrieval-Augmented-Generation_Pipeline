"The authors identified a crucial structural difference between the bl2 loops of mers-plpro and sars-plpro that explains the selectivity of inhibition. This structural difference is the presence of a deubiquitinating function in mers-plpro, whereas sars-plpro has a deisubiquitinating function.",PMC4845099,PMC4845099_0
"The authors determined the crystal structure of mers-plpro and found that it is similar to that of sars-plpro, with the exception of the bl2 loop. The bl2 loop of mers-plpro differs significantly from that of sars-plpro, as it is more flexible and can adopt multiple conformations, whereas the bl2 loop of sars-plpro is in a fixed conformation.",PMC4845099,PMC4845099_1
The authors determined the catalytic activity of both mers-plpro and sars-plpro and found that the catalytic efficiency (kcat/km) of sars-plpro is âˆ¼45-fold higher than that of mers-plpro.,PMC4845099,PMC4845099_2
"The authors performed a high-throughput screening of a library of 25,000 compounds against both mers-plpro and sars-plpro and identified a dual noncovalent inhibitor against mers-plpro. This inhibitor was selective for mers-plpro over sars-plpro due to the structural differences in the bl2 loops of these enzymes.",PMC4845099,PMC4845099_3
The authors performed an inhibitor selectivity assay against both mers-plpro and sars-plpro and found that the inhibitor selectivity was due to the structural differences in the bl2 loops of these enzymes. This assay involved testing a lead sars-plpro inhibitor (i-1) and two human ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolases (uch-l1 and uch-l3) and two unrelated enzymes (hepatitis c virus ns3 serine protease and b. Anthracis dihydroorotase) using a fluorometric assay.,PMC4845099,PMC4845099_4
