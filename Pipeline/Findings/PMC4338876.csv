"Structural studies of coronavirus spikes have revealed that they are clove-shaped trimeric proteins with three individual s1 heads, and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of s1-ctd is located at the tip of each spike. Ace2, a cell surface protein, binds to the tip of the spike trimer, where s1-ctd is located.",PMC4338876,PMC4338876_0
"Coronavirus spike proteins have evolved at different paces to recognize different receptors. The RBD of s1-ctd, which is directly exposed to the host immune system, evolves at the fastest pace due to its location on the very tip of the spike trimer, while the less exposed s1-ntd, which is likely located underneath s1-ctd, evolves at a slower pace.",PMC4338876,PMC4338876_1
"Coronavirus s1-ntd domains, which recognize sugar receptors, are likely located underneath s1-ctd. Between the two s1 domains, the more conserved s1-ntds may function as more reliable RBDs that recognize high-affinity protein receptors, allowing coronaviruses to search for additional and high-affinity protein receptors using their fast-evolving s1-ctds.",PMC4338876,PMC4338876_2
"Coronavirus s1-ctd domains, which recognize protein receptors, have divergent structures across different coronavirus genera, but all contain a common virus-binding hot spot. The crystal structures of these s1 domains will reveal how sugar receptor specificities are achieved in coronavirus s1-ntds across different coronavirus genera.",PMC4338876,PMC4338876_3
"Coronavirus s1-ctd domains, which recognize protein receptors, appear to have a novel fold not related to any other proteins in the protein structure database. However, structural topology analysis is a powerful tool to identify structural homology among viral proteins. This approach may help identify the evolutionary origin of coronavirus s1-ctds.",PMC4338876,PMC4338876_4
