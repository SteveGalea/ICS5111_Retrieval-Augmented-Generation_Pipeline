"Inhibition of sars-cov-induced cpe in vero cells by sirna: The study found that out of the six vector-based sirnas, only two, psr02 and psr03, could effectively block sars-cov replication in vero cells. Both of these sirnas target the rna polymerase, which suggests their potential as alternatives for vaccines against sars-cov.",PMC434119,PMC434119_0
"Sequence conservation in different sars-cov strains: The target sequences of psr02 and psr03, which can efficiently inhibit sars-cov replication, are conserved in all the sars-cov strains published in the genbank database. This sequence conservation between different sars-cov strains may avoid the possibility that the sequence variation between different sars-cov strains may restrict sirna inhibitory effects.",PMC434119,PMC434119_1
"Effectiveness of vaccine: Vaccine is one of the most effective ways to interfere with viral infection. However, genetic mutation in the segments encoding the major antigenic proteins may pose potential problems for the development of effective vaccines due to sequence variation between different sars-cov strains.",PMC434119,PMC434119_2
"Nonspecific double-stranded rnas: The study noted that exogenously introduced plasmids can lead to the generation of nonspecific double-stranded rnas, which in turn induce interferon production and inhibit viral replication to some extent.",PMC434119,PMC434119_3
"Vector selection: The vector psr was selected as an sirna expression vector as it can be used to generate recombinant retroviruses, which has been shown to be effective in most cell lines and many primary cell types and provides great facility for further clinical application studies.",PMC434119,PMC434119_4
"Rapid mutations: The variations of s protein among strains of sars-cov pose potential problems for the development of effective vaccines due to sequence variation between different sars-cov strains. Rapid mutations in the segments encoding the major antigenic proteins may lead to antigenic protein sequence variation between different sars-cov strains, which may restrict sirna inhibitory effects.",PMC434119,PMC434119_5
"Target sequence selection: In order to avoid the possibility that the sequence variation between different sars-cov strains may restrict sirna inhibitory effects, the target sequences were chosen with consideration given to sequence conservation between",PMC434119,PMC434119_6
