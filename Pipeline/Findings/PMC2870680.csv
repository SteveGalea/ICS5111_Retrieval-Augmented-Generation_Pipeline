"For highly contagious influenza strains, the size of the epidemic does not depend on heterogeneity in the degree distribution if no intervention is performed. This is due to the fact that major epidemics occur in more than 99% of simulations, regardless of whether infection is predominantly transmitted via close or casual contacts.",PMC2870680,PMC2870680_0
"For moderately contagious influenza strains, the size of the epidemic depends on heterogeneity in the degree distribution, even in the absence of interventions. The average number of infections increases from approximately 1000 when the variance is low to approximately 3000 when the standard deviation (s.d.) is high.",PMC2870680,PMC2870680_1
"The effectiveness of intervention in controlling epidemics in networks with low variance is high for moderately contagious influenza strains. However, for highly contagious influenza strains, the probability of an epidemic occurring and/or the final size of the epidemic does not depend on heterogeneity in the degree distribution, regardless of whether infection is predominantly transmitted via close or casual contacts.",PMC2870680,PMC2870680_2
"Heterogeneous degree distributions can increase the infection attack rate (i.a.r.) of epidemics, which is produced by moderately effective transmission and targeted intervention. However, contact patterns will influence intervention success less, if intervention is targeted geographically rather than socially, as assumed in this investigation.",PMC2870680,PMC2870680_3
"The type of network and the population size have an effect on the probability of an epidemic occurring and/or the final size of the epidemic, but clustering is a negligible factor with respect to epidemiological outcomes in the networks studied here in the case of an influenza epidemic. However, it is not yet clear to what extent this effect is restricted to networks built on the basis of preferential attachment.",PMC2870680,PMC2870680_4
