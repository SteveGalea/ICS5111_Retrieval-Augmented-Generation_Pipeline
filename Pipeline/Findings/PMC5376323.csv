"The study presents the sequence-based characterization of cytochromes c7 family members, with a focus on distinguishing features of ppca and ppcd compared to other homologs. The study highlights some chemical groups and their percentage that can distinguish ppca and ppcd, as well as unique cycles for ppca and ppcd involving various sub-domains. The use of reduced alphabets (amino acids) technique involving mathematical basis with embedded chemical properties of amino acids will be useful for protein homology detection.",PMC5376323,PMC5376323_0
"The study suggests that percent identity among the five members of cytochromes c7 family members varies between 46% and 75%, with some chemical groups and their percentage that can distinguish ppca and ppcd. These findings are shown between 75% and 89%. The study proposes a graph theoretic model that can easily show the instant change of amino acids from one group to the other in the sequences, with unique cycles for ppca and ppcd involving various sub-domains.",PMC5376323,PMC5376323_1
"The study emphasizes the distinguished features of ppca and ppcd compared to other homologs, with a conclusion that the unique cycles for ppca and ppcd may expose their outstanding nature. The study notes that there are some existing methodologies that would reflect the sequence pattern information or key features of the observed sequence, but the proposed graph theoretic model can show the instant change of amino acids from one group to the other in the sequences and unique cycles for ppca and ppcd involving various sub-domains.",PMC5376323,PMC5376323_2
"The study suggests that it may be noted that there are some existing methodologies in this regard, such as defined in [11, 14, 16, 20, 22, 25, 30], that would reflect the sequence pattern information or key features of the observed sequence, and the use of reduced alphabets (amino acids) technique involving mathematical basis with embedded chemical properties of amino acids will be very much useful for protein homology detection.",PMC5376323,PMC5376323_3
"The study notes that although the study suggests that percent identity among the five members of cytochromes c7 family members varies between 46% and 75%, on the basis of chemical groups these are shown between 75% and 89%, the use of reduced alphabets",PMC5376323,PMC5376323_4
