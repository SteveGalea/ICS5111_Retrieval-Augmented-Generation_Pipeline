"The study compared the predictions of Knotinframe, a new and efficient tool for the automated detection of ribosomal −1 frameshift events, to the predictions of a previous approach by Jacobs et al. In a comparison of 167 strong candidates, only 13 were supported by both methods. The reasons for this include differences in the structure prediction methods and the criteria used for ranking, with Knotinframe using normalized dominance, whereas Jacobs et al. Used z-scores and free energy for ranking.",PMC2566878,PMC2566878_0
"The study found that Knotinframe outperformed previous approaches in terms of compute resources, allowing the systematic annotation of available genome sequences. With a complete genome sequence of 8.76 mb, the whole computation, including 43841 observed slippery sites, could be performed in approximately 4.5 cpu hours, which is a significant improvement over previous approaches.",PMC2566878,PMC2566878_1
"The study showed that Knotinframe has a high sensitivity on annotated −1 prf events from the recode database, with a clear improvement over previous approaches in terms of accuracy.",PMC2566878,PMC2566878_2
"The study extended the repertoire of structural building blocks in Locomotif by a pseudoknot building block, making it easy for workers in the field to construct their own pipelines, similar to Knotinframe, for RNA motifs of moderate size, with and without pseudoknots.",PMC2566878,PMC2566878_3
"The study showed that the real genome sequences used in the evaluation contain more slippery sites than expected, with the first filter (isf) discarding approximately 42% of slippery sites for the recode test set, before the expensive folding step and run time decreased.",PMC2566878,PMC2566878_4
"The study showed that the normalized dominance, used by Knotinframe, is better suited for the task of discriminating true −1 prf signals from random ones, compared to the z-score used by Jacobs et al. The normalized dominance makes an exact statement of how likely a given sequence folds into a frameshift-inducing structure and not into an alternative one, against its present competitors, which are those that exist in the folding space of the given RNA sequence, rather than against those that might exist in the past/future of a mutated sequence.",PMC2566878,PMC2566878_5
