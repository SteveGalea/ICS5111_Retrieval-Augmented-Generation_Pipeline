"The study identified three novel viruses in farmed and wild Pacific salmon in British Columbia, Canada: Piscididnavirus salmonis (PSV), Piscicidnavirus salmonis var. Salmonis (PSV-S), and Piscididnavirus salmonis var. Salar (PSV-Sr).",PMC6721791,PMC6721791_0
"The viruses were found to have a wide distribution in farmed and wild salmon, suggesting a potential risk to wild Pacific salmon populations.",PMC6721791,PMC6721791_1
"The study also reported the presence of PSV-S in wild Chinook salmon, indicating a potential spillover from farmed Atlantic salmon, which could have significant implications for aquaculture and wild salmon conservation.",PMC6721791,PMC6721791_2
"The viruses were detected in multiple tissues and organs, suggesting a systemic infection in the host fish.",PMC6721791,PMC6721791_3
The study highlights the need for continued monitoring and research to better understand the epidemiology and impact of these viruses on Pacific salmon populations.,PMC6721791,PMC6721791_4
