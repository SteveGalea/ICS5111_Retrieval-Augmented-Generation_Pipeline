"The chicken oviduct is susceptible to infection with different strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), with varying degrees of sensitivity.",PMC4076756,PMC4076756_0
"The qx strain displays a higher infectivity rate in primary chicken oviduct epithelial cells compared to the b1648 strain, indicating different binding properties of the spike proteins to the oviduct epithelial cells.",PMC4076756,PMC4076756_1
"The binding of the spike proteins of both strains to the oviduct epithelial cells is dependent on sialylated glycans expressed on the cell surface, but the varying sensitivity of the cells to infection with the two strains asks for a different explanation.",PMC4076756,PMC4076756_2
The different sensitivity of the cells to infection with the two strains may impact the organ tropism and subsequently the pathotype of a certain IBV strain.,PMC4076756,PMC4076756_3
"The chicken oviduct is a highly valuable tool to investigate IBV infections, as the sensitivity of the epithelial cells to viruses in a reproducible way can be analyzed in the presented organ culture system, but future experiments have to further investigate the characteristics and mechanisms allowing successful IBV infection of oviduct epithelial cells.",PMC4076756,PMC4076756_4
