"Type III interferons (IFNs) are induced by viral and bacterial infections, as well as by certain drugs and vaccines, in addition to type I and II IFNs.",PMC4899229,PMC4899229_0
"Type III IFNs have been shown to play roles in viral and bacterial infections, as well as in the superinfection of respiratory viruses with bacterial pathogens.",PMC4899229,PMC4899229_1
"Type III IFNs induce a similar repertoire of genes as type I IFNs over a prolonged period of time, and several studies have identified several pathogens that appear to flourish when type III IFN is induced.",PMC4899229,PMC4899229_2
"Clinical data and the use of knockout mice have identified several pathogens, such as hepatitis C, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Staphylococcus aureus, that appear to flourish when type III IFN is induced.",PMC4899229,PMC4899229_3
"Type III IFNs have been implicated in the development of bacterial superinfection, as they contribute to enhanced disease phenotype and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection in a murine model of superinfection of respiratory viruses with bacterial pathogens.",PMC4899229,PMC4899229_4
