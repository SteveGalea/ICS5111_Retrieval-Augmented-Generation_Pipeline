"The aids epidemic in Brazil follows a logistic-type growth of total aids cases per year, with an exponential regime in the first few years of the aids spreading. This pattern suggests a competition of increasing and establishing agents, typically associated with a new infection in a confined area. The parameter obtained from this analysis is in good agreement with the growth of aids in some European countries.",PMC4207789,PMC4207789_0
"The growth in the absolute frequency of aids cases in Brazil is decreasing with time, consistent with the literature. The fluctuations after ca. 1992 occur because it is the region where the small time scale is already broken (ca. 10 years for aids). The infection in Brazil is running to a plateau, and assuming that this behavior is mainly due to the results of the programs and strategies against the aids infection, the first results of these efforts occurred mainly in urban centers with an average of more than 10 aids cases per year.",PMC4207789,PMC4207789_1
"The distribution of the aids epidemic in Brazil in small spatial scales (over cities) follows a super-linear allometric pattern, with an exponent typically around 1.9. This pattern is consistent with the literature and predicts that the infection over cities scales with the population in that region. The infection in Brazil is expected to lose its strength in the largest urban centers, where the average of more than 84 aids cases per year, because the fluctuations of cases appear to be smaller.",PMC4207789,PMC4207789_2
"New aids cases in Brazil are still growing in cities of the groups I and II, which have an average of less than 10 aids cases per year. The average number of new infections per year (as well as their fluctuations) in these cities merit further attention from the Brazilian health authorities. However, the first results of the efforts against the infection occurred mainly in urban centers with an average of more than 10 aids cases per year.",PMC4207789,PMC4207789_3
