"In a study investigating the role of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibition in reducing reperfusion damage in hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (IR), researchers found that administration of nanoparticles conjugated with MMP-9 binding peptides (nap9) reduced downstream expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the heart, and improved cardiac contractility when compared to nanoparticles conjugated with MMP-9 binding peptides containing an ap9 scrambled peptide (napsc).",PMC4775864,PMC4775864_0
"In another study, researchers found a close correlation between the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal enhancement and myocardial infarction in mice injected with nap9, but nap9 had no effect when administered 1 day before IR, whereas upon administration at the time of and 1 day after IR, nap9 improved left ventricular function and reduced MMP-9 expression, which may be explained due to reduced expression of MMP-mediated extracellular matrix degradation in healthy hearts.",PMC4775864,PMC4775864_1
"The study also revealed a significant reduction in MMP-9 expression in mice subjected to IR and injected with nap9, compared to mice injected with nanoparticles conjugated with MMP-9 binding peptides containing an ap9 scrambled peptide.",PMC4775864,PMC4775864_2
"In addition, the study found that nap9 nanotherapy was effective in improving performance of hearts subjected to IR, restoring functional parameters and preventing MMP-mediated extracellular matrix degradation.",PMC4775864,PMC4775864_3
"However, the study also highlighted the need for additional nanoparticle formulation to avoid potential nanoparticle-derived side effects, as administration of nap9 had no effect when administered 1 day before IR.",PMC4775864,PMC4775864_4
