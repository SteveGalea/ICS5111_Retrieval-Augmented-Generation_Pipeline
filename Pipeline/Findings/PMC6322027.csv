"Mucociliary differentiation is a complex process regulated by notch signaling during normal development and during repair after injury. Once fated, nascent mucociliary cells launch a gene expression program that activates expression of hundreds of structural and regulatory ciliary genes, including the ""edm"" (edf4/5, dp1, mcidas [multiciliate differentiation and dna synthesis associated cell cycle protein]) transcriptional complex, which drives several secondary transcriptional regulators, including forkhead box j1 (foxj1), that remain active to maintain mucociliary gene expression.",PMC6322027,PMC6322027_0
"Ciliary structure and function are highly vulnerable to damage from cigarette smoke, chronic inflammation, and pathogens. Primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder of mucociliary clearance, involves the absence or abnormal movement of cilia due to mutations in genes responsible for cilium biogenesis or motility.",PMC6322027,PMC6322027_1
"Mucin glycosylation is a multistep process that occurs within domains composed of proline, serine, and threonine–rich imperfect repeats. Glycans affect the biophysical functions of mucus gels, as well as the potential for mucin interactions with pathogens and other host cells.",PMC6322027,PMC6322027_2
"Muc5b carries endogenous α2,3-linked sialoside ligands of siglec-f that initiate eosinophil apoptosis in mice. In humans, sialoside carriers, including muc5b, supply ligands for siglecs that suppress the functions of eosinophils (siglec-8) and neutrophils (siglec-9).",PMC6322027,PMC6322027_3
"The relative extents to which the functional consequences of mucin glycosylation are isoform specific, genetically determined, or environmentally controlled are beginning to be clarified. Efforts are underway to more completely characterize glycans carried by muc5ac and muc5b (and their mouse orthologs) across individuals and anatomic sites in respiratory tissues.",PMC6322027,PMC6322027_4
