"Culture-independent molecular methods have revealed vastly greater microbial diversity in indoor environments compared to traditional culture- and microscopy-based methods. Indoor air in buildings contains a smaller quantity of culturable bacteria than what is found outdoors, and indoor air includes a combination of mostly gram-positive cocci and rods.",PMC5069963,PMC5069963_0
"Indoor spaces often harbor unique microbial communities in ways that we did not previously understand. For example, indoor air samples from 29 homes in San Francisco, CA, contained major contributions from nearly 20 other taxa ranging from comamonadaceae to methylocystaceae, with staphylococcus making up only ~4% of the identifiable taxa in indoor air.",PMC5069963,PMC5069963_1
"Human and pet sources dominate indoor bacterial communities, and humans are also major sources of bacteria to indoor surfaces and indoor air. For example, repeated studies of varied indoor environments have used source-tracking algorithms to illustrate that humans (and pets, if present) often dominate bacterial communities found on indoor surfaces.",PMC5069963,PMC5069963_2
"Building design and operation can influence indoor microbial communities. For example, spaces with a high human occupant diversity and a high degree of physical connectedness to other spaces contained a unique collection of bacterial taxa compared to spaces with low levels of connectedness and occupant diversity.",PMC5069963,PMC5069963_3
"Exposures to the “right” number of the “right” kinds of microbes may be beneficial for human health. For example, mice exposed to dog-associated house dust had a distinct gut microbiome composition and were protected against airway allergen challenges, and lower fungal diversity in house dust was significantly associated with childhood asthma development in a small case-control study.",PMC5069963,PMC5069963_4
