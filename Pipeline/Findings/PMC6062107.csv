"The study reports partial protective efficacy of 78% against lethal cchfv challenge in a highly susceptible, immunocompromised mouse model using an ad-based vaccine vector expressing the cchfv n (ad-n).",PMC6062107,PMC6062107_0
"The study suggests that ad-n protects by mechanisms distinct and perhaps complementary to those of mva and dna platforms, as protection by ad-n has been previously reported as rare and non-protective for ebola and cchfv, respectively.",PMC6062107,PMC6062107_1
"The study highlights the critical role of the conserved cchfv antigen n in protection against cchfv, as protection by ad-n as demonstrated in this study is achieved using only the more conserved cchfv n antigen.",PMC6062107,PMC6062107_2
"The study suggests the importance of immune responses directed against multiple antigens and the need for as few doses as possible, as the study utilized a single antigen (n) in the ad-based vaccine vector, and partial protective efficacy of up to 78% following a prime-boost vaccination strategy mediated by this more conserved cchfv antigen.",PMC6062107,PMC6062107_3
"The study underscores the critical role of immune responses directed against the gpc, as vaccine studies utilizing n as the sole antigen are rare and have been non-protective for ebola and cchfv, respectively, but here protection by ad-n as demonstrated in this study provides critical information for future development of cchfv vaccines and suggests that ad-n protects by mechanisms distinct and perhaps complementary to those of mva and dna platforms.",PMC6062107,PMC6062107_4
