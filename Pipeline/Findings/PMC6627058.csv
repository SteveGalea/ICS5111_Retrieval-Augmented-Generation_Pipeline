"Seven phlorotannins (1-7) were isolated from Ecklonia cava using column chromatography, and their structures were identified by spectral analysis. Compounds 3 and 5 potentially inhibited tyrosinase catalytic reaction by blocking the entrance to the active site or forming complexes with the enzyme.",PMC6627058,PMC6627058_0
"Compound 3 underwent simple reversible slow binding with tyrosinase, while compound 5 initially formed a complex with the enzyme quickly, followed by an isomerization step to create a new enzyme-type complex. These findings suggest that the flexible phloroglucinol backbone of phlorotannins containing this moiety bound easily into the active site of tyrosinase.",PMC6627058,PMC6627058_1
"Molecular simulation study indicated that compounds 3 and 5 were docked at the active site of tyrosinase with Autodock scores of −6.59 and −6.68 kcal/mol, respectively. Both compounds used amino acids His85 and Asn260 to maintain their connection with tyrosinase.",PMC6627058,PMC6627058_2
"The findings imply that compounds 2-phloroeckol (3) and 2-o-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-6,6′-bieckol (5) might inhibit the production of melanin products.",PMC6627058,PMC6627058_3
"Slow-binding inhibition analysis showed that the progress curves followed linear equations for both compounds, indicating a potential slow-binding mechanism.",PMC6627058,PMC6627058_4
