"The crystal structure of the sars-cov viral protein (PLPRO) reveals that its active site is both unobstructed and in a catalytically competent configuration, indicating that activation may not be a requirement for efficient, PLPRO dub activity. This structure also expands the available arsenal of structural templates of different sars proteins that can be targeted for inhibition by therapeutic compounds and thus disrupt the replication of sars-cov.",PMC1458639,PMC1458639_0
The crystal structure of PLPRO provides important structural and mechanistic insights into the family of coronavirus PLPROs. Future studies of PLPRO will be aimed at elucidating the potential dual role of this enzyme in proteolytic processing of the replicase polyprotein and deubiquitinating activity of viral and cellular proteins during viral replication.,PMC1458639,PMC1458639_1
"Site-directed mutagenesis and sars-cov trans-cleavage assays have been performed, which provide insights into the importance of specific residues in PLPRO's enzymatic activity and deubiquitinating function.",PMC1458639,PMC1458639_2
"The crystal structure of PLPRO in complex with its cognate substrate, ubiquitin, provides a detailed view of the enzyme-substrate interaction and the structural basis for PLPRO's deubiquitinating activity.",PMC1458639,PMC1458639_3
"The PLPRO structure reveals that the n-terminal domain of PLPRO has a structural fold similar to both ubiquitin and isg15, which classifies it as a ubl domain. Future studies will investigate the potential dual role of this enzyme in proteolytic processing of the replicase polyprotein and deubiquitinating activity of viral and cellular proteins during viral replication.",PMC1458639,PMC1458639_4
