"The study identifies rig-i, but not mda5 or tlr3, as the mediator for activation of ifn responses by two shrnas that are distinct in sequence and structure but both capable of ifn induction in human cells.",PMC2770676,PMC2770676_0
"The study shows that delivery of these shrnas via lentiviral transduction does not reduce their ifn-inducing capacity, indicating that the ability of lentiviral vector transduction to avoid ifn induction by shrnas, as reported previously, may not be universally applicable to all the shrnas.",PMC2770676,PMC2770676_1
The study demonstrates that ifn activation by sh-b971 exhibited a stringent dependence on specific nucleotides at multiple positions of the shrna.,PMC2770676,PMC2770676_2
The study shows that ifn activation by sh-b971 is independent of its ability to suppress target mrna expression through rnai.,PMC2770676,PMC2770676_3
"The study shows that a synthetic shrna that has the same sequence as sh-b971 but lacks the 5′-ppp failed to induce ifn, suggesting the 5′-end status of the intracellularly expressed shrna contributes to ifn activation.",PMC2770676,PMC2770676_4
