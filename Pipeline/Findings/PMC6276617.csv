"The amc/dcba lozenge, which contains the active ingredients amylmetacresol (amc) and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (dcba), demonstrates bactericidal activity against a broad range of bacterial species associated with pharyngitis, including gram-positive cocci (such as Streptococcus pyogenes), gram-negative cocci (such as Haemophilus influenzae), and gram-negative bacilli (such as Fusobacterium necrophorum).",PMC6276617,PMC6276617_0
"This bactericidal activity is achieved within a 10-minute period, which is consistent with the duration that a lozenge remains in the mouth.",PMC6276617,PMC6276617_1
"For all test organisms, bactericidal activity of greater than 99.9% is achieved within 10 minutes, which is consistent with the time taken for a lozenge to dissolve in the mouth.",PMC6276617,PMC6276617_2
"The amc/dcba lozenge provides relief from the symptoms of pharyngitis, particularly sore throat, likely through its demonstrated local anesthetic-like action against voltage-gated neuronal sodium channels.",PMC6276617,PMC6276617_3
"By relieving symptoms and managing patient expectations, the number of instances of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for viral pharyngitis may be reduced, as the role of the patient's immune system and swallowing action on the antimicrobial activity of the lozenge or active ingredients cannot be determined using in vitro methodology.",PMC6276617,PMC6276617_4
