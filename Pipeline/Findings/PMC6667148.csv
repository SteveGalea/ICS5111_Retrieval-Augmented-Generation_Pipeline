"The study found that cats in southern Italy are more frequently exposed to and infected with Leishmania infantum, as indicated by a higher seroprevalence of 10.5% compared to central (2.3%) and northern (1.6%) regions.",PMC6667148,PMC6667148_0
"The study identified three areas in southern Italy with a significant higher proportion of Leishmania infantum positive cats, located in Bari, Messina, and Lecce provinces.",PMC6667148,PMC6667148_1

"The study found that cats positive for Leishmania infantum DNA were more frequently detected in seronegative animals (72.7%) compared to cats with a positive serological test, possibly indicating an early stage of infection or differences in immune responsiveness between dogs and cats.",PMC6667148,PMC6667148_3
