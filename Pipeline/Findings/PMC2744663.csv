"In this three-country cohort matched on maternal age, gestational age, and number of previous pregnancies, significant differences exist in optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life. Women in Ghana reported the highest levels of optimism, while Chinese women reported the lowest levels of optimism.",PMC2744663,PMC2744663_0
"Physical functioning, general health, vitality, and role emotional subscales of the SF-12 also show significant differences by country. Women in the US reported the lowest physical functioning and vitality scores, while Ghanaian women reported the highest general health and general health scores, and Chinese women reported the highest vitality scores.",PMC2744663,PMC2744663_1
"Multivariate linear regression analysis identified four key variables that predict approximately 20% of the variance in overall LotR scores: country of origin, working for money, level of education, and ever being treated for emotional issues with medication.",PMC2744663,PMC2744663_2
"The samples differ significantly on several key variables, such as educational attainment and reports of current and previous treatment for emotional issues.",PMC2744663,PMC2744663_3
"The samples were likely very different in terms of standard of living, which may have contributed to the observed differences in optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life. However, income data were missing or uncertain in interpretation, which made meaningful comparisons challenging at best, misleading at worst.",PMC2744663,PMC2744663_4
The authors suggest that future research needs to address the question of whether the underlying constructs of optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life are conceptualized similarly across cultures. Further research is warranted that explores the potential link between psychosocial constructs such as these and measurable health outcomes. Only then can researchers and practitioners explore the possibility of interventions to influence what have typically been seen as stable constructs.,PMC2744663,PMC2744663_5
