"The study found that treatment of bl cells with tlr9 ligands, specifically odn cpg-2006, induced a significant increase in hil-10 expression, a cytokine associated with inflammation and tumor progression.",PMC3388232,PMC3388232_0
The study also found that bl cells from patients with a high risk of progression to aggressive disease stages expressed significantly higher levels of the tlr9 co-receptor compared to bl cells from patients with a low risk of progression.,PMC3388232,PMC3388232_1
The study reported that bl cells from patients with a high risk of progression to aggressive disease stages had a significantly higher apoptotic rate compared to bl cells from patients with a low risk of progression.,PMC3388232,PMC3388232_2
"The study found that treatment of bl cells with tlr9 ligands led to a significant increase in caspase-3/7 activity, which is associated with apoptosis.",PMC3388232,PMC3388232_3
The study also found that bl cells from patients with a high risk of progression to aggressive disease stages had a significantly higher caspase-3/7 activity compared to bl cells from patients with a low risk of progression.,PMC3388232,PMC3388232_4
