"In a study of 125 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) patients, chest radiographs revealed that a substantial portion (33%) of the patients who recovered had abnormal findings, characterized by the presence of lung fibrosis, ground-glass opacities, and pleural thickening.",PMC5644332,PMC5644332_0
The incidence (33%) of lung fibrosis seen in patients who recovered from MERS-CoV is similar to the incidence (38%) of lung fibrosis detected in patients who recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).,PMC5644332,PMC5644332_1
"Patients with lung fibrosis detected on follow-up chest radiographs were associated with a greater number of intensive care unit (ICU) admission days, older age, higher chest radiographic score, and higher peak lactate dehydrogenase level.",PMC5644332,PMC5644332_2
"The presence of pulmonary fibrosis developed rather rapidly in the study population, with a mean ± standard deviation, median, and range of lung fibrosis development of 82.4 ± 66 days, 44 days, and 32–230 days, respectively, after discharge from the hospital.",PMC5644332,PMC5644332_3
"The exact triggers which initiate the lung fibrotic process remain unknown, but if infection plays a causal role in the process of pulmonary fibrosis, then it is possible that therapeutic strategies utilizing currently available antiviral or antibiotic drugs may be effective in modifying the course of this dreadful condition.",PMC5644332,PMC5644332_4
