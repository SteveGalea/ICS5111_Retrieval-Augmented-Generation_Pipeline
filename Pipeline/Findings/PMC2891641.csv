"The study found that the majority (66.7%) of hcrc genetic testing recipients exhibited little or no depression and anxiety from pre-disclosure baseline until one year after disclosure of the results, while only a minority (13.0%) of the sample exhibited a delayed reaction trajectory, i.e. they reported low levels of anxiety and depression initially but their anxiety and distress levels increased beyond the threshold at t3 or t4.",PMC2891641,PMC2891641_0
"The study found that even when the depression and anxiety levels of the subjects at t1 were statistically controlled, hope was still predictive of their resilience trajectories, suggesting that high-hope individuals adjust more readily to the results of hcrc genetic testing than their low-hope counterparts.",PMC2891641,PMC2891641_1
"The study found that only a minority (8.7%) of hcrc genetic testing recipients exhibited chronically elevated symptoms for hads anxiety and depression, and that the prevalence of delayed reaction trajectories in this investigation was higher than that observed in previous studies conducted in western countries (5-10%).",PMC2891641,PMC2891641_2
"The study found that the psychological distress towards discharge after hospitalization, as well as the potential for social discrimination and communication issues among family members relating to the testing results, may only surface some time after result disclosure for hcrc genetic testing recipients.",PMC2891641,PMC2891641_3
"The study found that the high prevalence of resilience trajectories and the low prevalence of chronic dysfunction trajectories in this investigation suggest that hcrc genetic testing induces a milder level of stress in its subjects, compared to other stressful events.",PMC2891641,PMC2891641_4
