"In the study by Jørgensen et al., four herds with persistent diarrhoea in neonatal piglets were selected based on certain criteria, including a history of neonatal diarrhoea for at least one year, vaccination against escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens type C, failure of preventive antibiotic medication of sows, and negative results of routine diagnostic examination for enteritis in five piglets.",PMC4110237,PMC4110237_0
"The study by Jørgensen et al. Suggested that neither clostridium perfringens type A, clostridium difficile, strongyloides ransomi, giardia spp, nor cryptosporidium spp was involved in the diarrhoeal outbreaks.",PMC4110237,PMC4110237_1
"In the study by Jørgensen et al., gross-pathological findings in affected piglets were characterized by flaccidity of intestines with no mucosal lesions and milk-filled stomachs.",PMC4110237,PMC4110237_2
"In the study by Jørgensen et al., the presence of hollow flanks, protruding ribs, fore-knee abrasions, and dehydration was too low prevalent to be included in the statistical models due to problems with complete separation, caused by sparse data.",PMC4110237,PMC4110237_3
"In the study by Jørgensen et al., population average odds ratios (ORpa) were calculated using the following formula: ORpa = exp βss / sqrt 1 + 0.346 * δ2litter where βss is the subject-specific regression coefficient and δ2litter is the litter variance. The population averaged, rather than cluster-specific estimates of ORs, were used since the study aimed at drawing general rather than litter-specific conclusions.",PMC4110237,PMC4110237_4
