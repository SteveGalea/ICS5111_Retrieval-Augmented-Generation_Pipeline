"In the context of educational technology, a key finding is the importance of designing learning experiences that are engaging and interactive. This finding is supported by research that shows that interactive learning experiences can lead to significant improvements in learning outcomes, particularly for students who are at risk of academic failure (Graesser et al., 2014). This finding has important implications for the design of learning experiences, as it highlights the need to incorporate interactive and engaging elements to promote effective learning outcomes.",PMC2796142,PMC2796142_3
"In the context of instructional design, a significant finding is the importance of incorporating feedback and reflection into learning experiences. This finding is supported by research that shows that incorporating feedback and reflection into learning experiences can lead to significant improvements in learning outcomes and student engagement (Kizilcec & Schunk, 2014). This finding has important implications for the design of learning experiences, as it highlights the need to incorporate",PMC2796142,PMC2796142_4
