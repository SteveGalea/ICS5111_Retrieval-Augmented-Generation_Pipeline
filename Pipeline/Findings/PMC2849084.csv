"The authors found that sars-CoV mpro undergoes substrate-induced dimerization, which is reversible upon removal of the substrates. This dimerization is a dynamic equilibrium between the active and inactive protomers, and substrate binding induces and stabilizes enzyme dimerization, which then activates the enzyme molecule.",PMC2849084,PMC2849084_0
"Mutation of arg-298 or gln-299 to alanine significantly reduces the enzyme activity, while mutation of both residues to alanine abolishes the enzyme activity. This suggests that both arg-298 and gln-299 are involved in the rate-limiting step for mpro catalysis.",PMC2849084,PMC2849084_1
"The authors found that the wild-type mpro is a dimer, while mutation of arg-298 in r298a significantly reduces the enzyme activity. However, mutation of both arg-298 and glu-166 in r298a/l significantly blocks the substrate-induced dimerization.",PMC2849084,PMC2849084_2
"The authors found that the enzyme activity of the wild-type mpro and its mutants, r298a and r298a/l, shows a nonlinear upward dependence between the enzyme activity and enzyme concentration.",PMC2849084,PMC2849084_3
"The authors found that the enzyme concentration-dependent enzyme activity experiment indicated that only the dimer is enzymatically active, and the protein-concentration-dependent enzyme activity experiment showed a significant size shifting toward the dimeric form in the presence of peptide substrates. This suggests that there is a rapid equilibrium between the monomer and dimer in solution, and the protein-concentration-dependent enzyme activity experiment showed that in the presence of peptide substrates, the major species of the r298a/l mutants showed significant size shifting toward the dimeric form, which became clear in the d2o environment. The substrate-induced dimerization of r298a/l was reversible upon removal of the substrates.",PMC2849084,PMC2849084_4
