Type I interferon (IFN) signaling directly and independently protects natural killer (NK) cells from elimination via natural killer cell-mediated fratricide during virus-specific NK cell expansion. This protective role of type I IFN signaling in NK cells is in addition to its previously established role in promoting NK cell expansion during viral infection.,PMC4749923,PMC4749923_0
"IFN signaling in NK cells is required for the survival and expansion of NK cells during lethal mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, and the expansion defect in IFN-deficient NK cells is nearly as pronounced as that of the IL-12 receptor-deficient NK cells.",PMC4749923,PMC4749923_1
"Type I IFN signaling in NK cells inhibits the expression of natural killer group 2 (NKG2) ligands in a manner similar to that of IL-12, providing a complementary role for IL-12 in NK cell-mediated fratricide during virus-specific NK cell expansion.",PMC4749923,PMC4749923_2
"NKG2D ligand-induced NKG2D signaling is required for the survival and expansion of NK cells during viral infection, and NKG2D ligand-deficient mice exhibit a selective expansion defect in NK cells during virus-specific NK cell expansion.",PMC4749923,PMC4749923_3
"A novel role for IL-12 signaling in NK cells is revealed, as IL-12 signaling is required for the survival and expansion of NK cells during viral infection, and IL-12 signaling inhibits the expression of NKG2D ligands in a manner similar to that of type I IFN signaling in NK cells.",PMC4749923,PMC4749923_4
