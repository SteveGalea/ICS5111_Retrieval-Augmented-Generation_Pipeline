"In the context of estimating spatial spread parameters, a technique using the conservation of conditional pairs is presented. This method is computationally efficient and practical for estimating parameters from a single spatial sample, as collecting spatial data is frequently a time-consuming and difficult process. The estimation technique can work from a single spatial sample, providing accurate estimates from the initial sample without the need for secondary follow-up studies. The method can be used with multiple snapshots by minimizing the deviation ξ across all snapshots. The technique is robust to moderate spatial heterogeneities and multiple seeds before coalescence of invading wave fronts. The estimation technique is applicable to a variety of other uses, from the invasion of unwanted species to understanding the spatial interactions of competing organisms.",PMC428489,PMC428489_0
