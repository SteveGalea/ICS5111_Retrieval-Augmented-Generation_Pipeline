"The authors present a new computational approach to predict complex pseudoknot structures in RNA molecules, which allows for the calculation and tabulation of entropy parameters for such structures. This approach, based on a domain-reduction approach, is computationally feasible for large RNA molecules and can predict the structure of a 400-nt sequence in less than 4 hours, whereas existing models can only treat sequences less than 100 nt.",PMC3346314,PMC3346314_0
"The authors also develop a domain-based approach to treat pseudoknot-forming long sequences, which scales the computer time for searching for the 5′ domain boundary nucleotides algebraically with the sequence length. For a sequence of 400 nt, it takes less than 4 hours to predict the full structure for a system with m = 5 domains.",PMC3346314,PMC3346314_1
"The authors provide a new method to calculate and tabulate entropy parameters for loop structures in complex pseudoknot motifs, which extends the Vfold model to treat more complex structures. This approach allows for the calculation and tabulation of entropy parameters for such structures and can predict the structure of a 400-nt sequence in less than 4 hours, whereas existing models can only treat simple h-type pseudoknot structures.",PMC3346314,PMC3346314_2
"The authors compare the computational times for their model and other existing models and find that their model is slower than Hotknots, Probknot, Star, and Pknots-rg and faster than Pknotsre and NuPack.",PMC3346314,PMC3346314_3

The authors also provide a table with fitted parameters A, B, and C for the loop entropies in equation 1,",PMC3346314,PMC3346314_4
