"Findings: The proposed framework for emergency ethics reviews combines increased diligence with enhanced procedural flexibility in proportion to the perceived risks and specific circumstances associated with research protocols during emergencies. This framework addresses the three main policy challenges of research ethics review procedures: the need for thorough and careful review with accountability, the importance of timely review to gain critical knowledge, and the requirement for proportionality between the level of scrutiny and the risks and circumstances involved.",PMC2950185,PMC2950185_0
"Findings: The proposed emergency ethics review process is triggered by an official declaration of a public emergency, and protocols submitted to a research ethics board for review during emergencies would immediately be assessed for the risks associated with the proposed research, as well as the identification of important novelties or uncertainties that might require enhanced scrutiny. Complex protocols and those assessed as involving a high level of risk to participants or to the community would be assigned a greater number of principal, or ""in-depth,"" reviewers, representing relevant expert perspectives.",PMC2950185,PMC2950185_1
"Findings: The proposed framework for emergency ethics reviews would require any relaxation or alteration of procedural requirements of national and international guidance documents to be proportionate to the complexity and urgency of the emergency and to the risks posed by the specific research proposals under review. Depending on the volume of submissions to a research ethics board, protocols related to an emergency may either be reviewed individually by the chair of the board or the chair's delegate, or examined by the chair or a specific triage committee and prioritized according to applicable substantive ethics guidelines.",PMC2950185,PMC2950185_2
"Findings: The proposed framework for emergency ethics reviews would enhance attention to ethically relevant aspects of the study and improve the availability of members of the research ethics board for other time-sensitive reviews related to the emergency. The use of nonexperts by research ethics boards in addition to expert members would provide redundancy in the review, which is a key measure for enhancing scrutiny.",PMC2950185,PMC2950185_3
"Findings: The proposed framework for emergency ethics reviews would require heightened monitoring of a proposed study as a means of enhancing ongoing assessment of risks and potential benefits, especially in protocols in which understanding of the risks and benefits of a novel intervention is expected to evolve quickly, such as in a treatment trial of an acute, life-threatening disease.
