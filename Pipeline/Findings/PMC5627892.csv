"A pilot study in a primary care setting found that a fluid chart, a simple and inexpensive intervention tool, was feasible and acceptable to use in managing suspected dengue patients in primary care.",PMC5627892,PMC5627892_0
"The study showed that the fluid chart was able to produce a positive effect on the measured outcome, as evidenced by a reduction in hospital admission and the requirement for intravenous fluid therapy in the group that was given the fluid chart.",PMC5627892,PMC5627892_1
"The study found that among the participants suspected to have dengue fever, the fluid chart was able to produce a reduction in hospital admission and the requirement for intravenous fluid therapy, as evidenced by a hospital admission rate of 7.6% in the control group and 10.0% in the intervention group.",PMC5627892,PMC5627892_2
"The study found that the fluid chart was able to produce a consistent increase in the amount of oral fluid intake, as evidenced by a mean fluid intake of about 3,000 ml per day from day 1 to day 6 of the clinic consultations in the intervention group.",PMC5627892,PMC5627892_3
"The study found that the fluid chart was able to produce good participant retention rates, as evidenced by a default rate of 11.8% in the control group and 14.7% in the intervention group, which is lower than the default rate of 33.8% in a previous study among patients who were suspected to have dengue infection.",PMC5627892,PMC5627892_4
