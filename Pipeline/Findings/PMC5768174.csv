"In a study by Lee et al. (2017), fastviromexplorer, a new tool for detecting and quantifying viruses in metagenomic data, was applied to fecal samples collected from a donor and recipient following fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). The study found that fastviromexplorer, which can process millions of reads within minutes and has similar virus detection accuracy to the gold standard tool blastn, can detect both viruses and phages depending on the reference database used. The study also highlighted the pressing issue of building and/or extending the current viral sequence database for improving virus/phage detection and quantification in metagenomic data.",PMC5768174,PMC5768174_0
"In the same study, the abundance of phages with host bacteria from the order bacteroidales increased dramatically and the abundance of the order Clostridiales decreased greatly in the recipient's post-FMT samples, suggesting either the successful transferring of the mvc from the donor to the recipient or the great enrichment of the mvcs in the recipient as a result of FMT.",PMC5768174,PMC5768174_1
"In another study by Paez-Espino et al. (2016), fastviromexplorer was applied to ocean microbiome samples collected at multiple time points. The study found that fastviromexplorer was able to successfully identify some contigs that resemble the original 483 scaffolds, which could subsequently be used to assemble the actual viral sequences found in the samples.",PMC5768174,PMC5768174_2
"In the same study, while using the gov contig set (Roux et al., 2016) as a reference, a novel viral sequence was identified, highlighting the pressing issue of building and/or extending the current viral sequence database for improving virus/phage detection and quantification in metagenomic data.",PMC5768174,PMC5768174_3
"In a simulation study, fastviromexplorer, which can process millions of reads within minutes and has similar virus detection accuracy to the gold standard tool blastn, was applied to simulated data sets. The study found that the tool had a high recall, precision, and F1 score, indicating its effectiveness in detecting and quantifying viruses in metagenomic data.",PMC5768174,PMC5768174_4
"In the simulation study, the tool's performance was compared to that of viromescan, another tool for detecting viruses",PMC5768174,PMC5768174_5
