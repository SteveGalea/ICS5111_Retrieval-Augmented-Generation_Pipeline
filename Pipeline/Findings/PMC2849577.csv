"The present study identified canine herpesvirus type 1 (CHV) as the causative agent of a severe outbreak of canine infectious tracheobronchitis (ITB) in a large animal medical center, with almost half of the dogs harboring latent CHV infection.",PMC2849577,PMC2849577_0
"CHV is a monotypic virus with a low level of antigenic and genomic divergence, making it challenging to differentiate between isolates. RFLP analysis of genomic DNA, using the endonucleases HindIII, XbaI, and PvuI, can help differentiate CHV isolates from each other, with isolates from the same origin showing similar migration patterns.",PMC2849577,PMC2849577_1
"CHV isolates from the present study showed virulence similar to, but rather less than, that of a CHV strain isolated 30 years ago in Japan from pups with fatal hemorrhagic syndrome. This finding lends support to the recent proposal that CHV is a more significant pathogen than previously believed, especially when CHV infection occurs among stressed dogs in a group.",PMC2849577,PMC2849577_2
"The serological survey conducted in the present study indicated that the dogs in the area of Tokyo adjoining the hospital possess a higher prevalence of anti-CHV antibodies than the dogs raised in the suburban areas of Yamanashi or Hokkaido. Almost half of the dogs harbor latent CHV infection, indicating that they may become immunosuppressed due to stress caused by hospitalization, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation.",PMC2849577,PMC2849577_3
"The findings of the present study suggest that the number of immunosuppressed dogs was high enough to perpetuate transmission after the initial introduction of CHV, making it challenging to control the spread of infection in a group, especially in large animal medical centers where canine ITB occurs. Vaccination, including inactivated vaccines available in Europe to protect newborn pups from systemic infection, might be one of the choices applied to animals under such special circumstances.",PMC2849577,PMC2849577_4
