"The current study, which analyzed 1,585 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 441 lung transplant recipients, found that diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), the most severe form of lung injury, was associated with a 5-year incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) of 86%, as compared with only 43% for those without DAD.",PMC3863740,PMC3863740_0
"The study also found that DAD, which was not previously associated with CLAD, was associated with a profound increase in the risk of death, with recipients who had a single episode of DAD having a 5-year allograft mortality of 78%, as compared with only 41% for those without DAD.",PMC3863740,PMC3863740_1
"The findings suggest that DAD is an ominous sign of future graft dysfunction, particularly the RAS phenotype, which is associated with DAD and has a 5-year mortality of 78%.",PMC3863740,PMC3863740_2
"When an etiology for DAD could be determined, infection (viral and nonviral) was still the most common cause of DAD, followed by aspiration and severe acute rejection (AR).",PMC3863740,PMC3863740_3
"The study also found that chronic elevation of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid concentrations of chemokines involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells through their shared receptor, CXCR3, predicted the development of CLAD, suggesting a potential mechanism to explain the association between DAD, AR, lung injury, and CLAD.",PMC3863740,PMC3863740_4
