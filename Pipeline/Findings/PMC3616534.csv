"The study presents a novel lentiviral vector system for the measurement of activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in real time in live animals, allowing for linear quantification of NF-κB signaling in individual, genetically modified mice.",PMC3616534,PMC3616534_0
"The study demonstrates that resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung have the capacity to withstand a broad variety of inflammatory insults, including lentiviral transduction and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.",PMC3616534,PMC3616534_1
"The study shows that resident AMs in the lung persist in the alveolar space even after significant inflammatory injury, extending recently published observations on the prolonged life span of AMs in both the quiescent and inflamed lung.",PMC3616534,PMC3616534_2
"The study presents a gene transfer technique for the selective delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to genetically modified AMs in the lung, allowing for the measurement of NF-κB signaling in real time in live animals.",PMC3616534,PMC3616534_3
"The study demonstrates that resident AMs in the lung have accessibility for gene transfer, as previously described, and that AMs possess a long life span in both the quiescent and inflamed lung, extending recently published observations.",PMC3616534,PMC3616534_4
