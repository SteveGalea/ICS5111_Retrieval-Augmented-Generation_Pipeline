Younger age was also associated with increased risk of viral upper respiratory tract infections.,PMC3888147,PMC3888147_2
"The study suggests that higher serum 25(oh)d levels may be needed for prevention of viral upper respiratory tract infections, as lower levels were associated with increased risk.",PMC3888147,PMC3888147_3
