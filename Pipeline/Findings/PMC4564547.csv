A panel of 33 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated against Ebola virus (EBOV) and other ebolavirus species.,PMC4564547,PMC4564547_0
"Four mAbs (s3, s12, s17, and s33) cross-reacted with all five ebolavirus species due to recognition of a conserved epitope on the glycoprotein (gp).",PMC4564547,PMC4564547_1
"Western blot analysis revealed that two mAbs (s3 and s12) recognized only the EBOV gp, while the other two mAbs (s17 and s33) recognized the gp from all five ebolavirus species.",PMC4564547,PMC4564547_2
"The avidity for the gp epitopes of the five ebolavirus species was highest for the EBOV gp used during primary vaccination, and mAbs s12 and s17 showed the highest avidity for the RESTV gp.",PMC4564547,PMC4564547_3
"MAbs s12, s17, and s33 recognized distinct epitopes that are close together on the gp, as shown by competition assays.",PMC4564547,PMC4564547_4
