"In the context of the 2013-14 Chinese avian influenza A(H7N9) outbreak, this study identified two major clusters of infection based on geographic distribution and epidemic curves, which were further associated with distinct meteorological factors. The first cluster, mainly located in the eastern coastal provinces, was related to high temperatures and low humidity, while the second cluster, mainly located in the central and western inland provinces, was related to low temperatures and high humidity.",PMC4676028,PMC4676028_0
"The study also found that the risk of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses in China was significantly associated with meteorological factors, including temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. Specifically, high temperatures, especially above 20℃, and low humidity, especially below 60%, were significantly associated with an increased risk of infection, while low temperatures, especially below 5℃, and high humidity, especially above 80%, were also significantly associated with an increased risk of infection.",PMC4676028,PMC4676028_1
"In addition, the study highlighted the importance of considering both spatial and temporal distributions of meteorological factors, as well as their interactions, in the context of emerging infectious diseases. This was demonstrated by the finding that the temporal distribution of the 2013-14 Chinese avian influenza A(H7N9) outbreaks was significantly associated with both high temperatures and low humidity, while the spatial distribution was significantly associated with both low temperatures and high humidity.",PMC4676028,PMC4676028_2
"The study also emphasized the need for further investigation into the potential interactions between meteorological factors, as well as their effects on the transmission dynamics of emerging infectious diseases, given the complex and nonlinear relationships between meteorological factors and infection risks.",PMC4676028,PMC4676028_3
"Finally, the study suggested that the identified climate factors could provide important insights into the potential transmission pathways and risk factors of emerging infectious diseases, which could facilitate the development of more effective prevention and control strategies.",PMC4676028,PMC4676028_4
