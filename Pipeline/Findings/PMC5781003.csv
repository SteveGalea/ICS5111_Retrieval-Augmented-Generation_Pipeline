A systematic review and meta-analysis found that the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of respiratory viruses and bacteria in patients with community-acquired pneumonia resulted in increased sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional methods such as culture and antigen testing. (4 findings),PMC5781003,PMC5781003_0
A study of patients with community-acquired pneumonia in the Netherlands found that the use of real-time PCR for the detection of pneumococcal load was associated with specificity for etiologic diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. (4 findings),PMC5781003,PMC5781003_1
A systematic review and meta-analysis found that the use of real-time PCR for the detection of legionella species in patients with community-acquired pneumonia resulted in higher sensitivity and specificity compared to culture methods. (4 findings),PMC5781003,PMC5781003_2
A study of patients with community-acquired pneumonia in primary care found that the use of real-time PCR for the detection of respiratory viruses and bacteria resulted in higher sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional methods such as culture and antigen testing. (4 findings),PMC5781003,PMC5781003_3
A study of patients with community-acquired pneumonia in the Netherlands found that the use of a novel approach to the identification of streptococcus pneumoniae as the cause of community-acquired pneumonia using rapid urinary antigen testing resulted in higher sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional methods such as culture and antigen testing.
