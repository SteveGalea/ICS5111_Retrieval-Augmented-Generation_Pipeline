"Autophagy is activated during ablv infection in bat cells, and pharmacological activation of autophagy with rapamycin or bezabial reduces ablv replication.",PMC6466025,PMC6466025_0
"Black flying fox cells have a higher basal rate of autophagy compared to human cells, and autophagy serves as both an anti-viral and pro-survival mechanism in bat cells.",PMC6466025,PMC6466025_1
"Ablv infection increases autophagosome generation and autophagy in black flying fox and human cells, and autophagy activation in black flying fox cells is dependent on a high ablv moi.",PMC6466025,PMC6466025_2
"Autophagy activation with rapamycin or bezabial reduces wt-ablv replication in both black flying fox and human cell lines, suggesting autophagy antagonizes lyssavirus infection.",PMC6466025,PMC6466025_3
"Black flying fox cells maintain a higher basal rate of mitophagy, which serves as a secondary anti-viral role for autophagy in bats, as postulated by Brook and Dobson, 2015.",PMC6466025,PMC6466025_4
