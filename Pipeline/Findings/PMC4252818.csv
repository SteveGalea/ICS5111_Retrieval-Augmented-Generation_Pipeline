"In a recent study, a lncRNA termed nest has been found to target the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) complex to histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) regions in the genome, thereby epigenetically silencing gene expression and subverting host immunity against Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of cerebral malaria (CM).",PMC4252818,PMC4252818_0
"The lncRNA-Tare, a gene involved in brain function and neurodegenerative diseases, has been shown to enhance mRNA translation of its target gene by promoting its association with polysomes, highlighting its role in muscle differentiation.",PMC4252818,PMC4252818_1
"In addition to its role in muscle differentiation, the lncRNA linc-MD1 has been found to function as a competing endogenous lncRNA (ceRNA) in mouse and human myoblasts, sponging microRNA (miRNA) miR-133, thereby regulating the expression of genes involved in muscle differentiation.",PMC4252818,PMC4252818_2
"The lncRNA Lnc-DC interacts with the transcription factor STAT3, thereby regulating immune signaling pathways in immune cells.",PMC4252818,PMC4252818_3
"The lncRNA LeTHE, which binds to the transcription factor NF-ÎºB p50, has been shown to repress the expression of target genes in immune cells, highlighting its role in immune signaling pathways.",PMC4252818,PMC4252818_4
