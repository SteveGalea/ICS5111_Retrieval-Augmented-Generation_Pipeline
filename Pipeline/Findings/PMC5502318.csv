"The study found that il-10, a cytokine involved in suppressing protective immune responses to mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, is produced by activated effector Tbet+ T cells, which are the critical source of il-10 and account for increased susceptibility to M. Tuberculosis infection.",PMC5502318,PMC5502318_0
"The study also revealed that il-10 production in T cells during M. Tuberculosis infection is regulated by both interleukin-27 (IL-27) and type I interferon (IFN) signaling, with IL-27 and IFN signaling increasing IL-10 expression in T cells early during M. Tuberculosis infection.",PMC5502318,PMC5502318_1
"The study showed that neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), B cells, and T cells express IL-10 during M. Tuberculosis infection, with T cells being the critical source of IL-10 contributing to increased host susceptibility to M. Tuberculosis infection.",PMC5502318,PMC5502318_2
"The study found that IL-10 production by T cells during M. Tuberculosis infection is regulated by both IL-27 and type I IFN signaling, with IL-27 and IFN signaling increasing IL-10 expression in T cells early during M. Tuberculosis infection, and that different mechanisms regulate IL-10 expression in T cells at early and late times postinfection.",PMC5502318,PMC5502318_3
"The study demonstrated that IL-10-expressing CD4+ T cells, which are the biggest population of IL-10-expressing T cells throughout M. Tuberculosis infection, were highly activated and produced IFN-Î³ after antigen restimulation, suggesting that IL-10+ T cells simultaneously display effector function in addition to their regulatory activity during M. Tuberculosis infection.",PMC5502318,PMC5502318_4
