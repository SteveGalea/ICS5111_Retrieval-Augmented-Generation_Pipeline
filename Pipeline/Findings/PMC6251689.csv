"In a study of 532 children with radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia, a procalcitonin concentration below 0.1 ng/ml accurately identified children at lower risk of typical bacterial pneumonia, potentially limiting antibiotic use in 23% of children.",PMC6251689,PMC6251689_0
"In a similar study of 319 children with community-acquired pneumonia, a procalcitonin concentration below 0.25 ng/ml accurately identified children at lower risk of typical bacterial pneumonia, potentially limiting antibiotic use in 46% of children.",PMC6251689,PMC6251689_1
"In both studies, over 87% of patients received inpatient antibiotics, including 83% of those with only a viral pathogen detected, which may have hampered bacterial detection.",PMC6251689,PMC6251689_2
"In the current analysis, a procalcitonin concentration below 0.1 ng/ml had a negative predictive value of 100% (95% confidence interval, 94-100), potentially preventing antibiotic exposure in 23% of children.",PMC6251689,PMC6251689_3
"In the current analysis, a procalcitonin concentration below 0.25 ng/ml had a negative predictive value of 96% (95% confidence interval, 91-98), potentially limiting antibiotic use in 46% of children.",PMC6251689,PMC6251689_4
"In the current analysis, a procalcitonin concentration below 0.1 ng/ml accurately identified children at lower risk of intensive care unit admission, empyema, and longer hospital stays due to community-acquired pneumonia.",PMC6251689,PMC6251689_5
"In the current analysis, a procalcitonin concentration below 0.25 ng/ml accurately identified children at lower risk of intensive care unit admission, empyema, and longer hospital stays due to community-acquired pneumonia.",PMC6251689,PMC6251689_6
"In both studies, bacterial detection was more difficult due to the continued prevalence of bacterial causes of community-acquired pneumonia, as well as the high prevalence of antibiotic use, including in patients with only a viral pathogen detected.",PMC6251689,PMC6251689_7
"In the current analysis, a procalcitonin concentration below 0.1 ng/ml accurately identified children",PMC6251689,PMC6251689_8
