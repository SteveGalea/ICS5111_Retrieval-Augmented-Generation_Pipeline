These factors are non-modifiable and should be considered by policy makers and healthcare service managers when developing strategies to increase willingness to work.",PMC4415696,PMC4415696_0
"The study identified childcare obligations as a consistent barrier to healthcare workers' (HCWs) willingness to work during an influenza pandemic. This finding has implications for managers as they consider how to address this issue, as it may be driven by practical considerations or concerns about cross-infection.",PMC4415696,PMC4415696_1

"The study identified childcare obligations as a consistent barrier to HCWs' willingness to work during an influenza pandemic. This finding should be considered by managers as they consider how to address this issue, as it may be driven by practical considerations or concerns about cross-infection. Managers need to consider what help could be given in emergencies through the expansion of onsite or community childcare provision, as well as appropriate education and information programmes that can rapidly be rolled out when a pandemic is identified. Managers should also ensure that updating materials are readily available and regularly revised, so that programmes can be rapidly rolled out when a pandemic is identified.",PMC4415696,PMC4415696_4
