"The study found that the nsp4 n258t substitution in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) does not confer a temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype, contrary to previous reports.",PMC3804408,PMC3804408_0
"The study also found that the nsp4 n258t substitution resulted in a delay in exponential growth and decreased viral titers compared to wild-type (WT) virus, indicating that the n258 or loop 1 of nsp4 is likely important for replication.",PMC3804408,PMC3804408_1
The study demonstrated that the nsp4 n258t substitution did not result in altered localization of nsp4 to mitochondria at either 30 °C or 40 °C.,PMC3804408,PMC3804408_2
"The study found that loop 1 of nsp4 is important for viral replication, rNA synthesis, and double-membrane vesicle (DMV) formation, as mutations located in luminal loop 1 resulted in delayed growth and decreased viral titers similar to those of nsp4 n258t.",PMC3804408,PMC3804408_3
"The study suggests that the conservation of the aspartic acid residue at position 258 in loop 1 of nsp4 among beta-coronaviruses, including bovine coronavirus, human coronavirus OC43, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), as an aspartic acid, with MHV being the exception, may be important.",PMC3804408,PMC3804408_4
