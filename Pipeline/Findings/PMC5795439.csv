"N-linked glycosylation of at least one asn residue in tetherin is essential for its antiviral activity against HIV-1, as mutating a single site of n-linked glycosylation impairs the inhibition of virus release.",PMC5795439,PMC5795439_0
"Complex-type glycosylation of tetherin, which involves further modification of high-mannose oligosaccharides, is dispensable for its antiviral activity and cell-surface expression.",PMC5795439,PMC5795439_1
"The mannose trimming activity of mannosidase I, which is required for conversion of high-mannose to complex oligosaccharide side chains, is not essential for the cell-surface expression or antiviral activity of tetherin.",PMC5795439,PMC5795439_2
"N-linked glycosylation at a single asn residue is sufficient for trafficking of tetherin to the plasma membrane, as mutating the other asn residue does not affect its cell-surface expression.",PMC5795439,PMC5795439_3
"The double mutant, n65,92a, of n-linked glycosylation sites in tetherin is defective in both cell-surface expression and antiviral activity, and cannot be rescued by increasing the total expression of the mutant.",PMC5795439,PMC5795439_4
