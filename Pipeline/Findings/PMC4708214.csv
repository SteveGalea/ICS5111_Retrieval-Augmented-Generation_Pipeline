"Solid dispersion and nanoparticles (NPs) have shown better results than other formulations in improving the bioavailability and solubility of tanshinones, with solid dispersion being more efficient than NPs in enhancing the extended circulation time of tanshinones in the human body.",PMC4708214,PMC4708214_0
"Tanshinone preparations can be made using polymeric carriers such as plga, f68, and cbsa-peg-tniia-nps, and polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) of cpt with soy lecithin and tween 80 as emulsifiers.",PMC4708214,PMC4708214_1
"Tanshinone preparations can also be made using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and surelease, pvp and f68, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), and poly(vinyl alcohol)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PVA-PEG) graft copolymer.",PMC4708214,PMC4708214_2
"Solid dispersion and NPs have shown improved bioavailability and prolonged circulation times of tanshinones against hepatocellular carcinoma, with cbsa-peg-tniia-nps having shown significant neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke.",PMC4708214,PMC4708214_3
"However, most of these formulations lack tissue specificity, and there is a need for drug preparations with components that actively target tumor tissue or other parts of the body to enhance the pharmacological effects of tanshinones.",PMC4708214,PMC4708214_4
