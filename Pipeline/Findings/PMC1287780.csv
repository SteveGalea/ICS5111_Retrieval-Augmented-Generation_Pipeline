"The study developed a simple and economical method for monitoring circulating jembrana disease virus (jdV) using a jdVP26 antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which facilitates monitoring and detection of the jdVP26 antigen during the acute phase of jembrana disease.",PMC1287780,PMC1287780_0
"The sensitivities of the jdVP26 capture ELISA were not sufficient to detect circulating p26 prior to the acute febrile response or postrecovery, when low levels of circulating virus are thought to be present circulating in plasma.",PMC1287780,PMC1287780_1
"The ELISA provided virus titers that were consistently higher than those reported previously by bioassays, where id50/ml results were determined by titration of the virus by using cattle as indicator hosts.",PMC1287780,PMC1287780_2
"The use of the ELISA in Indonesia allowed monitoring of the changes in circulating viral antigens during vaccination trials and supported the previous findings that jdV has a short incubation period prior to the onset of an acute disease phase, characterized by high viral titers.",PMC1287780,PMC1287780_3
"The dynamics of jdV infection were consistent with the dynamics of other lentivirus infections, with a detectable virus load of up to 105 viruses/ml present in the period immediately prior to the onset of the acute febrile period that developed after a short incubation period, followed by a rapid increase in circulating virus concurrent with the development of the febrile period, with very high virus titers of up to 1012 virus/ml.",PMC1287780,PMC1287780_4
