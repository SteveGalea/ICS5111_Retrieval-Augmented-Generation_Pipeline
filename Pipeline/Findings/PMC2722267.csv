"The study found that the stability and efficiency of frameshifting (FS) in pseudoknot structures are influenced by multiple factors, including thermodynamic stability, length of stem and loop, torsional resistance, and specific interactions between stem and loop.",PMC2722267,PMC2722267_0
"For the pseudoknots studied, the efficiency of FS increased with the length of stem 1 and the number of base pairs in stem 2, and decreased with the number of base pairs in stem 2 and loop 1.",PMC2722267,PMC2722267_1
"The study also found that the formation of stable stem 2 with extensive loop 1-stem 2 interactions (Fig. 1d) prevented unwinding of stem 1, and thus, facilitated high-efficiency FS.",PMC2722267,PMC2722267_2
"The study revealed that destabilization of major-groove triplex structures formed between loop 1 and stem 2 significantly decreased FS efficiency, presumably due to lower global torsional resistance of the pseudoknot.",PMC2722267,PMC2722267_3
"The study showed that increasing the distance between elongating ribosomes allowed pseudoknot folding, resulting in a 2-fold increase in FS efficiency.",PMC2722267,PMC2722267_4
