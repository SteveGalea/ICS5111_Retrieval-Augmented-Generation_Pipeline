"A novel approach to resequencing SARS-CoV genomes has been developed, using a chip-based technology that combines high-density oligonucleotide arrays with a proprietary algorithm for primer design and statistical analysis of hybridization intensities. This method enables the rapid and accurate sequencing of small amounts of virus, making it feasible for use in clinical settings where virus samples may be limited.",PMC353227,PMC353227_0
"Using this technology, a consensus sequence for SARS-CoV was derived, and 30-mer oligonucleotides were generated to tile across the entire sequence. Primer pairs were selected based on their uniqueness against the human transcriptome, secondary structure, and other characteristics.",PMC353227,PMC353227_1
"Fragments of virus DNA were amplified using a nested-PCR strategy, and the resulting sequences were analyzed using a customized version of ABACUS software, which makes base calls based on the differential hybridization of genomic fragments to short perfect-match and mismatch oligonucleotides.",PMC353227,PMC353227_2
"The technology allows for the rapid assembly of complete genome sequences, and visualization and multiple sequence alignment can be performed using GeneRunner 3.05 software. A database of 50 SARS-CoV sequences was used for blast analysis.",PMC353227,PMC353227_3
"The new technology enables the rapid and accurate sequencing of small amounts of virus, making it feasible for use in clinical settings where virus samples may be limited. This is particularly important in light of the current global health crisis, as it will allow for the rapid identification of new SARS-CoV variants and the tracking of their spread.",PMC353227,PMC353227_4
