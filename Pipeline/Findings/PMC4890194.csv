"The emergence of novel viruses such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV-related viruses has caused severe illness and high case fatality rates, with MERS-CoV having a case-fatality rate of around 35%, SARS-CoV around 10%, and MERS-CoV-related viruses around 40%.",PMC4890194,PMC4890194_0
"MERS-CoV is transmitted through respiratory aerosols released by coughing or sneezing of an infected person, as well as through contact with contaminated surfaces and objects.",PMC4890194,PMC4890194_1
"SARS-CoV is also transmitted through respiratory aerosols, as well as through contact with contaminated surfaces and objects.",PMC4890194,PMC4890194_2
"Complications such as pneumonia, suffocation while breathing, and cardiac and liver failure are common in patients infected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.",PMC4890194,PMC4890194_3
"Preventive measures such as washing hands regularly, wearing disposable gloves, using a surgical mask, and disinfecting contaminated surfaces are recommended by WHO to prevent the transmission of these novel viruses. However, specific medicines for treatment of these viral infections and specific vaccines for the prevention of acute and often fatal illnesses caused by these novel viruses are not available yet, although tremendous efforts and research are ongoing.",PMC4890194,PMC4890194_4
