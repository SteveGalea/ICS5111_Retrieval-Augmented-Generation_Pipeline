"The authors have described two new reporter systems, ubl-ekl and ubl-gzmb, which are efficiently cleaved by ubiquitin/ubl proteases and are useful for quantifying activity.",PMC3065724,PMC3065724_0
"By selecting reporter enzyme substrates that generate fluorescent signals in nonoverlapping discreet wavelength ranges, the authors have combined them with the ubl-pla2 reporter system in a multiplex format, allowing for the measurement of three distinct protease activities simultaneously in a single well.",PMC3065724,PMC3065724_1
"The authors have demonstrated the utility of multiplexing enzyme assays for the characterization of enzyme specificity, as well as uncovered a previously unreported deisgylase activity of the enzyme USP21.",PMC3065724,PMC3065724_2
"The authors have established a multiplex assay format that allows for the simultaneous measurement of the protease activities of three distinct isopeptidases, which will facilitate the rapid initial characterization of novel ubiquitin/ubl protease inhibitors.",PMC3065724,PMC3065724_3
"The authors have shown that the multiplex format is amenable to hts providing researchers with an initial determination of inhibitor selectivity during primary screens of compound libraries, which is likely to speed the discovery of selective ubiquitin/ubl isopeptidase inhibitors for further development as potential therapeutic agents as well as tool compounds for studying the biological significance of a particular protease.",PMC3065724,PMC3065724_4
