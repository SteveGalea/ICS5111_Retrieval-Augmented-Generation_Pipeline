"Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPV3) was detected in coughing and nasal discharging cattle in China, causing mild respiratory illness.",PMC6631270,PMC6631270_0
"Three nasal swabs samples were positive for BPV3, and one sample, named BPV3-BJ, was successfully isolated and sequenced, revealing a low nucleotide similarity to BPV3 strains located in genotype B and genotype C.",PMC6631270,PMC6631270_1
"Phylogenetic analysis showed that BPV3-BJ is located within the cluster composed of BPV3 isolates of genotype A, including a strain isolated in Japan in 1987 and a recently isolated strain from China.",PMC6631270,PMC6631270_2
"The genetic divergence of strains of genotype A suggests that this genotype is continuously disseminated in distinct countries, likely affected by incoming strains from the USA and the European Union.",PMC6631270,PMC6631270_3
Further studies on local herds and shipments coming from abroad should be conducted to better address the dynamics of BPV3 in China and the pathways and impact of animal trade.,PMC6631270,PMC6631270_4
