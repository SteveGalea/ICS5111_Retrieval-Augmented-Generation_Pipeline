"In the presence of tfe, the structure of sars-cov hr2 is a trimer of parallel helices, as determined by NMR and analytical ultracentrifugation.",PMC3302656,PMC3302656_0
"In the absence of tfe, the structure of sars-cov hr2 is also a trimer of parallel helices, but with some intermediate effects on relaxation due to the approach of distant residues to the spin label site.",PMC3302656,PMC3302656_1
The flexibility of the unstructured state of hr2 facilitates conformational changes necessary for envelope-mediated membrane fusion.,PMC3302656,PMC3302656_2
The newly introduced disulfide bond at residue 14 of sars-cov hr2 affects the oligomerization state and orientation of hr2.,PMC3302656,PMC3302656_3
"The differences between the NMR- and X-ray-determined structures of sars-cov hr2 may be attributed to differences in the constructs, as the additional residues at the N-terminus of the NMR structure push the equilibrium towards the trimer of parallel helices.",PMC3302656,PMC3302656_4
