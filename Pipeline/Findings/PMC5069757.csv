Multi-omics integration using the mplex protocol allows for a more complete and accurate view of complex biological systems due to simultaneous extraction and partitioning of molecules into three different phases. This method eliminates the need for the monophasic extraction step used in the Folch method and reduces the number of replicates required for analysis.,PMC5069757,PMC5069757_0
"The mplex protocol has been successfully applied to a variety of sample types, including plant leaves, human urine, gram-negative bacteria, mouse brain tissue, and the archaeon sulfolobus acidocaldarius strain dsm 639.",PMC5069757,PMC5069757_1
"Integration of multi-omics data using the mplex protocol enables evaluation of quantitative differences between results of mock infection and infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus via a standard two-sample t test, as well as allows for manual curation of specific pathways of interest using VANTED v2.2.0 (36) plugin of Cytoscape v3.2.1 (34) along with function-enrichment analysis using LRPath.",PMC5069757,PMC5069757_2
"The mplex protocol facilitates the analysis of posttranslational modifications, as it simultaneously extracts and partitions molecules into three different phases.",PMC5069757,PMC5069757_3
"The mplex protocol has been shown to be robust and applicable for a variety of sample types, as it has been used for the analysis of proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics data from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus-infected cells.",PMC5069757,PMC5069757_4
