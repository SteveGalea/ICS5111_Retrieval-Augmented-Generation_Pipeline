"The successful generation and release of progeny hiv virions are believed to occur at the plasma membrane in most infected cells, and enhanced expression due to the presence of an intron is necessary for efficient nuclear export or rna stability or to prevent aberrant splicing events (28, 29).",PMC416513,PMC416513_0
"Infection by sars-cov s-bearing pseudotypes was blocked by bafilomycin a1, an inhibitor of vacuolar proton pumps (4, 69), demonstrating that sars-cov s-mediated infection of the kidney-derived cell line 293t and the hepatoma cell line huh-7 depends on low ph (38, 74).",PMC416513,PMC416513_1
"In order to understand sars pathogenesis, it is necessary to analyze liver tissue from sars patients in situ, as evidence for sars-cov replication in a macaque kidney cell line in vitro and the successful reisolation of sars-cov from kidney tissue from infected patients (16, 31) suggests that the virus replicates in these cells in vivo (75).",PMC416513,PMC416513_2
"The efficient infection of liver- and kidney-derived cell lines by s-bearing pseudotypes may have implications for sars pathogenesis, as the replication of sars-cov in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell has been reported, and the potential sars-cov infection of lymphoid cells in vivo requires further analysis (10, 37, 53, 71; d. a. Fisher, T. K. Lim, Y. T. Lim, K. S. Pingas, and P. Tambyah, Letter, The Lancet 361:1740, 2003; S. N. Panesar, Letter, The Lancet 361:1985, 2003).",PMC416513,PMC416513_3
"Sars-cov s-bearing pseudotypes exhibit a differential tropism for human cell lines, and the efficient infection of the kidney-derived cell line 293t and the hepatoma cell line huh-7 depends on low ph, as treatment with ammonium chloride or bafilomycin a1, an inhibitor",PMC416513,PMC416513_4
