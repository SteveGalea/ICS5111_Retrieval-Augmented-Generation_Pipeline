"Mvtt-s, a replication-competent vaccinia vector, offers greater advantage than mva-s for inducing high levels of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov through mucosal vaccination.",PMC2613559,PMC2613559_0
"Mvtt-s induces higher levels of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov in animals vaccinated via intranasal or intranasal/intranasal-oral (i.n./i.o.) routes compared to mva-s, even with a sub-optimal dose.",PMC2613559,PMC2613559_1
"Mvtt-s can overcome the pre-existing immune response to wild-type vaccinia through s.c. vaccination, allowing for the induction of higher levels of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov through mucosal vaccination.",PMC2613559,PMC2613559_2
"The replication-competent nature of mvtt allows for a minimized dose of vaccine, reducing the manufacturing burden and making the vaccine cost-effective.",PMC2613559,PMC2613559_3
"Mucosal vaccination with mvtt-s offers great advantages for inducing protective immune responses at mucosal sites of viral transmission and dissemination, making it an attractive live viral vector for the development of future mucosal vaccines.",PMC2613559,PMC2613559_4
