The study found a significant association between poor general condition and co-infection with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or with feline retroviruses in general in cats with sporotrichosis.,PMC6267967,PMC6267967_0
"Cats with sporotrichosis co-infected with FIV had lower percentages of CD4+ cells and higher percentages of CD8low+ cells, as well as a lower CD4:CD8 ratio, similar to findings in FIV-infected cats.",PMC6267967,PMC6267967_1
"The study showed a lower concentration of interleukin-12 (IL-12) in FIV-infected cats, which is consistent with the low concentration of IL-12 found in cats with sporotrichosis co-infected with FIV.",PMC6267967,PMC6267967_2
"The study found higher levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in FIV-infected cats, which is linked to a potential immunosuppressive profile in cats with sporotrichosis co-infected with FIV.",PMC6267967,PMC6267967_3
"The study found that the combination of itraconazole (ITZ) and ketoconazole (KI) in the treatment of cats decreased the median treatment length in cats, although this reduction was not statistically significant.",PMC6267967,PMC6267967_4
