"The study identified the plant Rhodiola rosea L. As a potential source for anti-filoviral agents, specifically against Ebola and Marburg viruses.",PMC5923446,PMC5923446_0
"The study showed that extracts from Rhodiola rosea L. Have strong anti-Ebola virus activities, with an IC50 value of 0.25 µg/ml in pseudovirus infection assay and an IC50 value of 3.9 µg/ml in an infectious Ebola virus infection assay.",PMC5923446,PMC5923446_1
"The study found that two chemically related compounds, gallic acid and ellagic acid, isolated from Rhodiola rosea L., are the most effective inhibitors among the 20 tested compounds, with IC50 values of 10.5 µm and 25.4 µm, respectively, against infectious Ebola virus infection.",PMC5923446,PMC5923446_2
The study suggested that the inhibitors act at a similar post-binding step in the endosome as cathepsin B inhibitor ca-074 or a previously characterized entry inhibitor benztropine that binds to the Ebola virus-gp protein and interferes with the gp-mediated fusion in the endosome.,PMC5923446,PMC5923446_3
"The study highlighted the importance of exploring traditional Chinese medicines and natural products as potential antivirals against Ebola virus and other viruses, as they have better coverage of biologically relevant chemical space and are more likely to reach the intracellular site of action than synthetic small molecules.",PMC5923446,PMC5923446_4
