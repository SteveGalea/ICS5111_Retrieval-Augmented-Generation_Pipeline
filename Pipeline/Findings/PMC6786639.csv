The study used metagenomics to monitor pathogens circulating in a population residing in two surveillance clusters of a Kenyan urban settlement called Kibera.,PMC6786639,PMC6786639_0
"The study found that giardia spp., plasmodium spp., ascaris spp., and blastocystis spp. were the most abundant parasite species throughout the study period.",PMC6786639,PMC6786639_1
The study observed that viral tests were not routinely performed on stools collected through the pbids surveillance system during this study period.,PMC6786639,PMC6786639_2
"The study demonstrated that the method applied, called metagenomics, has a high surveillance sensitivity and may become a valuable supplement for clinical and syndromic surveillance of large, urban populations, where early recognition of potential outbreaks is crucial for timely outbreak containment.",PMC6786639,PMC6786639_3
"The study found that viral tests were not routinely performed on stools collected through the pbids surveillance system during this study period, but the metagenomic findings were in line with previous studies, suggesting that metagenomics have a high surveillance sensitivity and may become a valuable supplement for clinical and syndromic surveillance of large, urban populations, where early recognition of potential outbreaks is crucial for timely outbreak containment.",PMC6786639,PMC6786639_4
