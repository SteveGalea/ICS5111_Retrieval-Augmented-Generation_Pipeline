"The mers-n protein, a structural component of the mers-cov virion, is able to regulate the expression of antiviral response genes at the transcriptional and translational levels in both a549 (lung) and 293ft (kidney) cells.",PMC6200698,PMC6200698_0
"The overexpression of mers-n in a549 cells leads to transcriptional and translational up-regulation of cxcl10, a cytokine belonging to the cxc chemokine family, suggesting that mers-n may contribute to the up-regulation of cxcl10 during mers-cov infection.",PMC6200698,PMC6200698_1
A fragment of mers-n consisting of residues 196-413 is sufficient to up-regulate cxcl10 expression.,PMC6200698,PMC6200698_2
Mers-n protein is one of the contributing factors for cxcl10 up-regulation during mers-cov infection.,PMC6200698,PMC6200698_3
"The mers-n protein is able to regulate multiple antiviral response genes, including tnf, il6, il8, and cxcl10, in different types of immune cells.",PMC6200698,PMC6200698_4
