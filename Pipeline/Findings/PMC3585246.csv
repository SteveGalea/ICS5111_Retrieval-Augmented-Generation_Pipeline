The study found that the presence of matrix proteins at the virion surface is necessary to maintain elongated virus shapes due to lipid phosphate displacement in the presence of matrix proteins.,PMC3585246,PMC3585246_0
"The study demonstrated that lipid phosphate is displaced in the presence of viral matrix proteins, and this displacement is matrix protein dependent and not solely due to transmembrane surface glycoproteins.",PMC3585246,PMC3585246_1
"The study showed that phosphate signal dimming effects are visible over a wide range of focal distance, and this effect is strongest in images where both phosphate rings are distinctly visible.",PMC3585246,PMC3585246_2
"The study showed that the inner phosphate ring signal intensity in virus particles is only 45±23% of the signal intensity in internal vesicle controls of similar size in the same image, indicating a significant reduction in inner phosphate ring signal intensity in the presence of matrix proteins.",PMC3585246,PMC3585246_3
"The study found that the inner phosphate ring signal intensity in arenavirus particles is 46±31% of the signal intensity in gp vesicle controls of similar size in the same image, indicating a significant reduction in inner phosphate ring signal intensity in the presence of matrix proteins.",PMC3585246,PMC3585246_4
"The study found that the inner phosphate ring signal intensity in influenza a virus particles is 45±23% of the signal intensity in internal vesicle controls of similar size in the same image, indicating a significant reduction in inner phosphate ring signal intensity in the presence of matrix proteins.",PMC3585246,PMC3585246_5
"The study found that the inner phosphate ring signal intensity in influenza b virus particles is 46±31% of the signal intensity in internal vesicle controls of similar size in the same image, indicating a significant reduction in inner phosphate ring signal intensity in the presence of matrix proteins.",PMC3585246,PMC3585246_6
"The study found that the inner phosphate ring signal intensity in mouse hepatitis virus particles is 46±31% of the signal intensity in internal vesicle controls of similar size in the same image, indicating a significant reduction in inner phosphate ring signal intensity in the presence of matrix proteins.",PMC3585246,PMC3585246_7
The study found that the inner phosphate ring signal intensity in influenza a virus particles is significantly lower than the signal intensity in vesicles using a linear mixed,PMC3585246,PMC3585246_8
