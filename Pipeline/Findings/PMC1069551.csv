"During coronavirus-induced encephalitis, the expression of mmp-3, mmp-12, and timp-1 mRNAs is restricted to a subset of cns resident cells, including astrocytes and microglia, as well as infiltrating cd4+ t cells, which are localized within the perivascular and subarachnoid spaces. This finding contrasts with the expression of mmp-3, mmp-9, and mmp-12 mRNAs in multiple cell types during eae, suggesting a correlation between cns inflammation and mmp expression.",PMC1069551,PMC1069551_0
"The expression of mmp-3, mmp-12, and timp-1 mRNAs during coronavirus-induced encephalitis is associated with a differential trafficking of t cells within the cns, with cd4+ t cells being localized within the perivascular and subarachnoid spaces, and cd8+ t cells being found within the cns parenchyma. The expression of timp-1 by cd4+ t cells implies an additional regulatory role for timps in preventing or delaying access to the cns parenchyma, which may contribute to controlling viral pathogenesis of the cns.",PMC1069551,PMC1069551_1
"Inflammatory cells, including neutrophils and cd4+ t cells, are recruited into the cns during coronavirus-induced encephalitis, leading to increased expression of mmp-3, mmp-12, and timp-1 mRNAs. However, during eae, the expression of mmp-3, mmp-9, and mmp-12 mRNAs is associated with the expression of multiple cytokines and chemokines, including ifn-Î², which acts synergistically with other cytokines to increase timp-1 mRNA while repressing timp-3 expression in brain microvascular cells.",PMC1069551,PMC1069551_2
