"This study identified a wide range of viruses in fecal material of ferrets, including coronavirus, hepatitis E virus, astrovirus, anellovirus, and papillomavirus.",PMC3748082,PMC3748082_0
"The prevalence of ferret coronavirus was similar in both cohorts of ferrets, but ferret hepatitis E virus was more frequently detected in household ferrets, possibly indicating cross-species transmission.",PMC3748082,PMC3748082_1
"The ferret kobuvirus identified in this study belongs to a distinct species in the genus kobuvirus, which may have resulted from past cross-species transmission events from bovine and ovine hosts.",PMC3748082,PMC3748082_2
The ferret papillomavirus identified in this study is the third species identified to date and may constitute a new genus in the family papillomaviridae based on the observed sequence divergence.,PMC3748082,PMC3748082_3
The ferret anellovirus identified in this study is most closely related to a recently identified anellovirus in pine marten and may represent a new genus in the family anelloviridae based on phylogenetic analysis.,PMC3748082,PMC3748082_4
