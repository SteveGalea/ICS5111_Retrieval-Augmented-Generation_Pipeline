"The study found that both Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf) and 'Candidatus' Mycoplasma haemominutum (Cmhm) infection, despite differing pathogenicity, are associated with an acute phase reactant (APR) in infected cats.",PMC3778745,PMC3778745_0
"The study found that infection with Mhf was associated with significantly higher serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations than Cmhm infection, indicating that SAA increases and peaks earlier than other APs following experimentally-induced inflammation.",PMC3778745,PMC3778745_1
"The study found that infection with Cmhm was also associated with significant increases in SAA, confirming induction of an APR by Cmhm, albeit of lower magnitude.",PMC3778745,PMC3778745_2
"The study found that the concentration of SAA remained within reference intervals in feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected cats with Cmhm or Mhf infection, but was significantly elevated, although to a highly variable degree between individuals, during acute Mhf, but not during acute Cmhm, infection.",PMC3778745,PMC3778745_3
"The study found that the retrospective nature of the study resulted in limitations, such as serum sample volumes not sufficient to facilitate the analysis of all three APs in all samples, statistical power limited by the relatively small number of animals in each group, and treatment periods for the Mhf- and Cmhm-infected cats being different, which limited statistical analysis of differences between the two infecting haemoplasma spp. More frequent sampling during the acute infection phase when the APR is maximal could have facilitated daily statistical comparisons.",PMC3778745,PMC3778745_4
