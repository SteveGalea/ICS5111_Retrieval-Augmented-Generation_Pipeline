"A study comparing nasopharyngeal swabs and wash collection for respiratory virus detection using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in hospitalized children found that nasopharyngeal swabs using traditional Rayon-tipped swabs had lower sensitivity compared to washes. However, nasopharyngeal swabs using flocked swabs, which improve the collection and yield of epithelial cells, had similar sensitivity as washes for most viruses tested.",PMC4655598,PMC4655598_0
"The study found that for some viruses, such as adenovirus (Adv), nasopharyngeal swabs using flocked swabs had lower sensitivity compared to washes. This could be attributed to low viral loads for Adv in the flocked swab samples, as the cycle threshold (Ct) value, which indicates the number of amplification cycles needed to detect viral RNA, was, on average, 3.3 cycles higher for Adv in flocked swab samples compared to wash samples.",PMC4655598,PMC4655598_1
"The study found that the sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swabs using flocked swabs was 100% when they were collected on the same day as the wash, which is reassuring regarding the similar sensitivity of the two methods. However, the uncertainty in the time of collection data could mask real differences in the two tests separated by larger periods of time.",PMC4655598,PMC4655598_2
"The study did not include older children/adults and immunocompromised patients, where viral shedding is commonly lower, so it is unclear how the flocked swab would perform in these populations.",PMC4655598,PMC4655598_3
"The study found that while the sensitivities for flocked swabs were similar to washes for most viruses tested, the flocked swab could reasonably replace washes as a collection method in clinical settings without significant loss of sensitivity for all the viruses tested, except for Adv. However, the study noted that collecting a wash followed by a flocked swab in the same nostril may reduce the number of cells collected by the flocked swab and reduce the sensitivity of the assay.",PMC4655598,PMC4655598_4
