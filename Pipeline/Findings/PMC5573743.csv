"The study found that increased expression of the toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 on circulating monocytes, as measured by flow cytometry, is a more sensitive predictor of coronary artery lesions (cals) in Kawasaki disease (KD) than serum silicon (Si)-10, a biomarker previously proposed for this purpose.",PMC5573743,PMC5573743_0
"The study showed that increased expression of tlr2 on circulating monocytes before the initial treatment of KD patients is associated with increased risk of ivig (intravenous immunoglobulin) resistance, a complication commonly observed in KD patients.",PMC5573743,PMC5573743_1
"The study suggested that monitoring tlr2 expression, which requires relatively few steps, could potentially be used as a relatively easy-to-use biomarker in KD due to its early feasibility as a predictor of cardiovascular disease burden and severity.",PMC5573743,PMC5573743_2
The study showed that ftlr2% before the initial treatment is a more sensitive predictor of cal development in KD than serum silicon (Si)-10 in KD patients.,PMC5573743,PMC5573743_3
The study demonstrated that ftlr2% before the initial treatment could also predict ivig resistance with sensitivity comparable to that of serum silicon (Si)-10 in KD patients.,PMC5573743,PMC5573743_4
