"A new epidemiological method for assessing the virulence of an emerging infectious disease at the early stage of an epidemic has been proposed. This method adjusts for underestimation due to time delay from onset to death and allows for the estimation of the unbiased confirmed case fatality ratio (ccfr). The proposed method has been applied to the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic in the US and Canada, and estimates suggest that the virulence of the novel pandemic strain is comparable to that observed in past influenza pandemics, with the lower bound of the ccfr close to the 0.1% range.",PMC2729920,PMC2729920_0
"The proposed method is particularly useful when there have been only a few deaths or even no death at all by time t during the course of an epidemic. In such situations, uncertainties surrounding the unbiased estimate of ccfr based on a few deaths can partly be addressed by sensitivity analysis of the estimate to different lengths of time from onset to death.",PMC2729920,PMC2729920_1
"Given that mean time from onset to death is around 9 days, weekly data do not enable the explicit adjustment of underestimation due to time delay from onset to death. Therefore, optimal reporting for surveillance and data sharing should be noted, and rather than updating the data based on date of reporting, it is critically important to summarize the data according to the date of onset both at local and global levels.",PMC2729920,PMC2729920_2
"During the final stages of revision, it came to our attention that an epidemiological study on ccfr of s-oiv with similar techniques and statistical philosophy has been published online, indicating that the preliminary estimate of ccfr for a combination of the US, Canada, and Mexico is 0.5% and emphasizing a need to accurately capture the cases for the denominator.",PMC2729920,PMC2729920_3
"The proposed method has been applied to the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic in the US and Canada, and estimates suggest that the virulence of the novel pandemic strain is comparable to that observed in past influenza pandemics, with the lower bound of the ccfr close to the 0.1% range. However, given that the number of deaths in the US and Canada was very small during the early stage, the spike in the biased ccfr during the very beginning of the epidemic may reflect probabilistic variations in the number of",PMC2729920,PMC2729920_4
