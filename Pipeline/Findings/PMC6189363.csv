"In the context of respiratory diseases, cd9+ b cells secreting interleukin-10 (IL-10) are associated with better lung allograft outcomes after lung transplantation through creating a favorable environment for the graft by reducing the inflammation leading to chronic lung dysfunction.",PMC6189363,PMC6189363_0
"In the context of cancer, cd9 expression is overexpressed on glioblastoma stem cells compared to its expression in healthy brain tissues, opening new therapeutic avenues for cd9 as a target for glioblastoma treatment, especially because xenotransplantation of cd9-silenced glioblastoma stem cells into nude rats promotes prolonged survival.",PMC6189363,PMC6189363_1
"In the context of bacterial infectious diseases, the use of anti-cd9 is tested for its anti-adhesive properties to inhibit bacterial adhesion to keratinocytes and has been shown to be effective in a tissue-engineered model of human skin infected with Staphylococcus aureus.",PMC6189363,PMC6189363_2
"In the context of asthma, the adoptive transfer of cd9+ b cells normalizes airway inflammation and lung function by inhibiting Th2- and Th17-driven inflammation in an IL-10-dependent manner, which restores a favorable immunological balance in lung tissues.",PMC6189363,PMC6189363_3
"In the context of lung transplantation, the use of molecules, such as statins, upregulating tetraspanin CD9 in macrophages and allowing decreases of inflammation are under consideration for therapeutic intervention.",PMC6189363,PMC6189363_4
