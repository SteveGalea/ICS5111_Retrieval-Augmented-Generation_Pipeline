"The study identified a population of cd8+ t cells that was induced by il-4 and controlled by the cell cycle regulatory protein cdkn2a, which is the first time it was reported to be involved in t cell differentiation.",PMC6607996,PMC6607996_0
These il-10-producing cd8+ t cells played a protective role in tnbs-induced colitis by suppressing the th1 response and decreasing the level of ifn-γ.,PMC6607996,PMC6607996_1
"The study showed that cd8+ t cells were induced to produce il-10 by il-4 and controlled by the cell cycle regulatory protein cdkn2a, and the effect was restricted to cd8+ t cells but was not identified in cd4+ t cells or apcs.",PMC6607996,PMC6607996_2
"The study demonstrated that il-10-producing cd8+ t cells expressed suppressing molecules (pd-1, ctla-4) and a high level of tc2 cytokines.",PMC6607996,PMC6607996_3
"The study observed that naïve mice treated with il-4 and il-2 had significantly lower levels of il-10 compared to mice treated with il-4 alone or mice treated with il-2 alone, suggesting that il-2 served as the growth and surviving factor in their system.",PMC6607996,PMC6607996_4
