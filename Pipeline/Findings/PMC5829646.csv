"In a large tertiary hospital, sample collection dates associated with microbiological testing are highly correlated with patient admission dates, with a high concordance of collection date and admission date for over 99% of samples with a listed collection date. This correlation is even stronger for inpatient testing, with collection dates allowing imputation of admission dates to the resolution of a week for over 90% of samples.",PMC5829646,PMC5829646_0
"For bacterial/fungal culture tests, the average length of stay is âˆ¼1 week, and metadata such as the setting of care can be gleaned from the type of microbiological organism sequenced.",PMC5829646,PMC5829646_1
"For viral tests, the correlation with admission date is higher for tests sent to the clinical laboratory in early admission and can be used to rule-in or rule-out infectious diseases through metagenomics, to detect antimicrobial or antiviral resistance, and to impute the transmission source.",PMC5829646,PMC5829646_2
"For both bacterial and viral tests, the collection dates allow imputation of the transmission source through metagenomics, and sequence data obtained for the detection of antimicrobial resistance can also be used for public health measures and infection prevention.",PMC5829646,PMC5829646_3
"The emergence of rich infectious disease genomic databases creates a pressure for clinical laboratories to share sample metadata and a demand for community guidance as to the manner in which such clinical metadata can appropriately be shared. Clinical laboratories and phylodynamics practitioners can take advantage of expert determination provisions for de-identification of data, or they can obtain blanket consent from patients to share such data. Alternatively, the clinical, scientific, and public health communities can determine that the benefits outweigh the costs and change privacy rules around high-resolution sample collection date sharing.",PMC5829646,PMC5829646_4
