The highest relative search volume (RSV) was in the three most affected West African countries.,PMC4674955,PMC4674955_1
"The queries varied by country, with differences in flux volumes and time courses between affected African countries and Western countries with primary cases.",PMC4674955,PMC4674955_2
"In affected African countries, web query search volumes were mostly concentrated in capital areas, while in Western countries, searches were uniformly distributed.",PMC4674955,PMC4674955_3
"The correlation between weekly Ebola cases and weekly GT indices varied from weak to moderate in affected African countries, while the correlation between all Ebola cases and GT indices was very high.
