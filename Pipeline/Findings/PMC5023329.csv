"The study found that vaccine-derived Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is widely circulating in wild bird populations worldwide, with at least 17 species from 10 different orders identified as shedders.",PMC5023329,PMC5023329_0
"The study also revealed that four different types of vaccine-derived NDV have been identified in at least 17 wild bird species from 10 different orders, with lasota- and b1-like viruses being shed more frequently than the rest.",PMC5023329,PMC5023329_1
"The study highlighted that the order Columbiformes, comprising primarily rock pigeons, had a high incidence of shedding vaccine-derived NDV, and this may be associated with the higher vulnerability to disease of juveniles due to their increased movement requirements for foraging, in concert with na√Øve immune systems.",PMC5023329,PMC5023329_2
"The study also suggested that the order Anseriformes, which has a high rate of detection of vaccine-derived NDV from wild birds representing declining species or species at imminent risk of decline, may reflect a higher degree of contact between wild birds and domestic members of this order as a result of the larger populations of ducks and geese used as poultry in Asia.",PMC5023329,PMC5023329_3
"The study also noted that species reported to shed vaccine-derived NDV are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as taxa of conservation concern, and some of the vaccine-derived viruses were obtained from wild birds representing declining species or species at imminent risk of decline, but the ecological implications of this finding are currently unknown.",PMC5023329,PMC5023329_4
