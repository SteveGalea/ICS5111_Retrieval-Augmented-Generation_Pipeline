"A panel of ha mutants was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the quikchange xl kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The introduced mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.",PMC3360650,PMC3360650_0
Avfluigg01 or its fab was used to neutralize the change of the ha protein to the low-ph conformation at pH 7.5 or 5.0 by addition of 0.1 m HCl and 0.1 m Tris (pH 10) at 37°C for 1 h.,PMC3360650,PMC3360650_1
"The virus binding assay was performed using ha (Viet04)-pseudotyped HIV viruses as described previously (Pierce, Madison, WI). The unbound viruses were removed by washing with cold PBS.",PMC3360650,PMC3360650_2
"The postattachment neutralization assay was adapted from previous studies (Pierce, Madison, WI). Avfluigg01 or a control mAb was serially diluted and added to the cells at 37°C for 1 h after washing three times by PBS (pH 7.4).",PMC3360650,PMC3360650_3
"The plasmid pGal4-vp16, which encodes the herpes simplex virus vp16 transactivator fused to the dna binding domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Gal4, was transfected into target cells in parallel with the plasmid pGal5-luc, which encodes the luciferase reporter gene under the control of a promoter containing five Gal4 binding sites. The day after transfection, the cells were incubated with various concentrations of tested antibodies diluted in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM) at 37°C for 1 h. After co-culturing for an additional 48 h, the cells were lysed by cell culture lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured by luciferase assay system (Promega). The percent inhibition and IC50 were calculated.",PMC3360650,PMC3360650_4
