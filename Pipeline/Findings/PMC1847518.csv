"The present study, a population-based genetic association study in Chinese patients with tuberculosis, revealed that the minor alleles of both slc6a and slc6b of the slc11a1 locus, which have been consistently found associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis in Asian populations, contribute to tuberculosis development in females or young patients (age â‰¤65 years) but not in elderly patients (>65 years) or in males.",PMC1847518,PMC1847518_0
"The study found that the slc11a1 locus, which is strongly linked to int4 and int5, is not associated with tuberculosis susceptibility, as previously reported.",PMC1847518,PMC1847518_1
"The study showed that ilc8rb, which is strongly linked to 5' slc11a1, is not associated with tuberculosis susceptibility.",PMC1847518,PMC1847518_2
"The study revealed that the slc11a1 locus, which is strongly linked to int3 and int4, is associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis in Asian populations, but not in European or African populations.",PMC1847518,PMC1847518_3
"The study suggested that the significant association between slc6a/b and tuberculosis in young patients and females is due to the ageing effect rather than direct genetic effects, as the elderly are a highly susceptible group with a higher case rate of tuberculosis due to the presence of other underlying chronic diseases and the biological changes associated with ageing.",PMC1847518,PMC1847518_4
