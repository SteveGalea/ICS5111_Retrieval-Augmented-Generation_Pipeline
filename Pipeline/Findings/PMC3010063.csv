"Palmitoylation is a posttranslational modification that plays a crucial role in regulating protein function and localization. It involves the covalent attachment of a 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitate, to cysteine residues in proteins.",PMC3010063,PMC3010063_0
"Palmitoylation is catalyzed by a family of enzymes called DHHC acyltransferases (DHHCs), which are localized to intracellular membranes. These enzymes transfer palmitate from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to specific cysteine residues in their substrate proteins.",PMC3010063,PMC3010063_1
"Palmitoylation is a highly regulated process that is tightly controlled by both positive and negative regulatory factors. Positive regulators include intracellular calcium ions, phosphorylation, and G proteins, while negative regulators include protein kinase C (PKC) and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP).",PMC3010063,PMC3010063_2
"Depalmitoylation is the reverse process of palmitoylation, which is catalyzed by thioesterases. These enzymes remove palmitate groups from previously palmitoylated proteins, thus reversing the effects of palmitoylation.",PMC3010063,PMC3010063_3
"Palmitoylation and depalmitoylation are important for the spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular membrane fusion reactions, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as vesicle transport, membrane trafficking, and synaptic transmission. Dysregulation of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation has been implicated in various diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.",PMC3010063,PMC3010063_4
