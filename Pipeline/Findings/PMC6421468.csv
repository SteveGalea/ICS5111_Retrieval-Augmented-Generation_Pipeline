"The study reveals that dnmti's, such as aza and dac, induce cell death through the activation of oas-rnase l, which is mediated by the mda5-rig-i/mavs/irf3–irf7-nf-κb signaling pathway.",PMC6421468,PMC6421468_0
"The study demonstrates that basal levels of oas isozymes are sufficient to mediate cell death through rnase l activation, as seen in cancer cells with wild-type p53.",PMC6421468,PMC6421468_1
"The study shows that aza-induced cell death through oas-rnase l is likely to preferentially target cancer cells expressing high levels of oas expression, as observed in many different primary malignant tumors.",PMC6421468,PMC6421468_2
"The study suggests that dnmti treatment of cancer cells with mutant p53 leads to massive dsrna accumulation, which can culminate in a cell-suicidal type i ifn response.",PMC6421468,PMC6421468_3
"The study implies that treatments that increase rnase l activity, such as the inhibition of pde12 or akap7, are predicted to increase the anticancer effects of aza or dac, while inhibitors of rnase l, such as val, are expected to mitigate the cytotoxicity of aza.",PMC6421468,PMC6421468_4
