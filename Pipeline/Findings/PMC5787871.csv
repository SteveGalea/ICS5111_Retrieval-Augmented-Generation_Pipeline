"The study describes two patients with Mirage syndrome, a recently identified form of congenital adrenal insufficiency caused by mutations in the SAMD9 gene. One patient presented with Mirage syndrome at birth, while the other developed it after undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation for myelodysplastic syndrome. Both patients had severe complications, including myelodysplastic syndrome, infection, restricted growth, adrenal hypoplasia, and enteropathy.",PMC5787871,PMC5787871_0
"The study found that the Mirage syndrome mutation identified in the second patient, c.2920g>a; p.E974K, had not been previously reported. Both patients also experienced complications related to their underlying Mirage syndrome, including temperature instability, enteropathy, and a predisposition to bacteremia.",PMC5787871,PMC5787871_1
"The study highlights the challenges of using allogeneic stem cell transplantation to treat patients with severe Mirage syndrome phenotypes, as both patients in this study died of posttransplant complications, despite engraftment.",PMC5787871,PMC5787871_2
"The study suggests that careful consideration of the benefits and risks of allogeneic stem cell transplantation is warranted in patients with severe Mirage syndrome phenotypes, even with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, and families should be aware of the potential for a protracted and particularly arduous post-transplant course.",PMC5787871,PMC5787871_3
"The study underscores the need for new specialized approaches for managing multiorgan complications of Mirage syndrome, particularly for patients with underlying adrenal insufficiency.",PMC5787871,PMC5787871_4
