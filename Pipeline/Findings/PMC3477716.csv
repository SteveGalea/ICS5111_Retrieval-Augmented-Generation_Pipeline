"NGR peptide-based agents for tumor imaging have shown promising results in preclinical studies due to their tumor-homing ability through binding to the αvβ3 integrin, which is overexpressed in many types of tumors.",PMC3477716,PMC3477716_0
"The sensitivity of nGR-based agents for tumor imaging is limited by the low signal-to-background ratio, and the introduction of quinacrine (qd) as a fluorophore has shown significant improvement due to its strong intrinsic fluorescence and ability to carry multivalent dyes for signal amplification.",PMC3477716,PMC3477716_1
"NGR peptide-based agents for tumor imaging have been modified by conjugating them to polymer carriers, resulting in increased targeting efficiency and signal intensity due to the multivalent modifications similar to qd.",PMC3477716,PMC3477716_2
NGR peptide-based agents for tumor imaging have been encapsulated in biodegradable di-block copolymers to avoid any toxicity and facilitate their use in vivo studies.,PMC3477716,PMC3477716_3
"Most nGR-based agents for tumor imaging have only been tested in cells, and future imaging work may involve the localization of αvβ3 integrin in cells or xenografts and the study of its correlation with nGR-labeled probes.",PMC3477716,PMC3477716_4
