"The study reports the results of analysis of a historic field case of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in England in 2000, which confirms the presence of the virus and indicates significant differences to other PEDV strains known so far.",PMC5088618,PMC5088618_0
Phylogenetic analysis of the consensus whole genome sequence obtained directly from the archived faecal sample indicates that the virus belongs to the PEDV species but lies distinct from any of the genogroups described by Huang et al. (2013).,PMC5088618,PMC5088618_1
"At the amino acid level, proteins from this PEDV strain vary in similarity from 91.5% to 96.3% compared to those of the CV77 strain, with the virus being significantly different from other PEDV strains known so far.",PMC5088618,PMC5088618_2
The study highlights the merit of further investigation of archived material from Europe and elsewhere to establish the degree of heterogeneity of historic PEDV strains and determine whether this England-1-2000 strain was typical of those circulating at the time in Europe.,PMC5088618,PMC5088618_3
"The lack of other published PEDV sequences from historic outbreaks of PEDV to the 2000s prevents further comparisons, but this clearly represents a genotype not described previously.",PMC5088618,PMC5088618_4
