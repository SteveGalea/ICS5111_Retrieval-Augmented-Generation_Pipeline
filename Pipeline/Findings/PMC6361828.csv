The sars-cov 3a protein is essential for inflammasome activation by the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) protein.,PMC6361828,PMC6361828_0
Both k+ efflux and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are required for sars-cov 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion.,PMC6361828,PMC6361828_1
"The 3a protein of sars-cov is localized to the plasma membrane and acts as a K+ channel, stimulating K+ efflux at the plasma membrane.",PMC6361828,PMC6361828_2
Infection with influenza virus A/PR8 or lentiviruses expressing the sars-cov 3a or E proteins inhibits IL-1β secretion when the extracellular K+ concentration is increased to 130 mM.,PMC6361828,PMC6361828_3
"The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by multiple mechanisms in the case of sars-cov, including the ion channel activity of sars-cov 3a and another viroporin 8a of sars-cov.",PMC6361828,PMC6361828_4
