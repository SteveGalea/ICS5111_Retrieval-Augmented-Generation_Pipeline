"In a study on the effectiveness of a new disease surveillance system, the HealthMap system, researchers found that it correctly classified 655 out of 778 reports over a one-month period, with an accuracy of 84%. This is a significant improvement over other sources, such as Google News, which has an accuracy of 81%.",PMC2274789,PMC2274789_0
"The researchers also noted that the system currently relies heavily on Google News, which leaves it biased toward English-speaking countries, but they plan to expand to other languages and data sources as resources permit.",PMC2274789,PMC2274789_1
"In addition to improving accuracy, the researchers are working on expanding the system's geographic coverage and improving its ability to cover a broad range of pathogens, limit noise, detect outbreaks early, and accurately characterize alerts in each dimension of classification.",PMC2274789,PMC2274789_2
The researchers also plan to conduct a usability observation study to gather feedback from their target demographic on priority features and improve the HealthMap user interface.,PMC2274789,PMC2274789_3
"The study also noted that the value of the HealthMap system lies in its ability to extract useful, customizable messaging and views from a mass of unstructured data, and that as more people use the system, and further significant outbreaks unfold in the global disease ecosystem, will be known the true potential of the software, and how best to improve it.",PMC2274789,PMC2274789_4
