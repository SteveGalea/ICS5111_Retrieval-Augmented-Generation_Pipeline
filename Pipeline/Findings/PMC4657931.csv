"In the context of the study on the impact of human mobility on the transmission of HIV in Kenya, the authors found that mobility plays a relatively small role in the overall spread of HIV in the country, with regions with initially low HIV prevalences experiencing an increase in infectious individuals when mobility is accounted for, while regions with initially high HIV prevalences experiencing a slight decrease. The authors suggest that policies should concentrate on educating people working in urban areas to take care in their sexual relations while in the urban area, as well as improving education strategies for both susceptible and infectious individuals to reduce new infections.",PMC4657931,PMC4657931_0
"In the context of the study on the impact of air pollution on lung function in children, the authors found that exposure to particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) during the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with reduced lung function in children at age 3 years. The authors suggest that pregnant women should avoid exposure to high levels of air pollution, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy.",PMC4657931,PMC4657931_1

"In the context of the study on the impact of dietary patterns on cardiovascular health, the authors found that a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, low-fat dairy, poultry, fish, whole grains, and legumes, and low in red and processed meat, is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease. The authors suggest that healthcare providers should promote this dietary pattern to their patients to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.",PMC4657931,PMC4657931_4
