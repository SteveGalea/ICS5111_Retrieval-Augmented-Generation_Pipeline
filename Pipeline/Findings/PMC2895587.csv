"Blood transcriptome profiling has emerged as a critical regulatory circuit of the immune system due to its small size, stability, and potential as a source of biomarkers. Short non-coding single-stranded RNA molecules, known as miRNAs, are about 22 nucleotides in length and have been found to play essential regulatory roles in immune function. They exhibit highly specific, regulated patterns of expression and control protein expression by translational repression, mRNA cleavage, or promotion of mRNA decay, and their small size allows for stable measurement in blood cells and in circulation in the serum.",PMC2895587,PMC2895587_0
Deconvoluting blood transcriptional signatures is a promising new field of investigation due to the complex nature of blood as a tissue. Changes in transcript abundance can be attributed to either transcriptional regulation or relative changes in composition of leukocyte populations. Isolation methods for individual cell populations in the blood may introduce technical bias and require extensive sample processing. An alternative approach is to deconvolute whole blood transcriptional profiles 'in silico' by deducing cellular composition or cell-specific levels of gene expression using statistical methodologies.,PMC2895587,PMC2895587_1
"Blood transcriptome profiling is becoming a mainstream tool for the assessment of the status of the human immune system due to the influence of genetic, epigenetic, cellular, and environmental factors. Changes in transcript abundance recapitulate the influence of these factors. The approach has become both robust and practical and is being used to study immune function in patients with a wide range of diseases.",PMC2895587,PMC2895587_2
"Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of blood transcriptome profiling for monitoring immune responses to drugs or vaccines. Blood transcript profiling is being used to provide complementary information to that obtained from whole blood profiles, as the immune status of a human subject is not entirely reflected by the blood profile obtained at the steady state. Blood transcriptome profiling is being used to assess the status of the human immune system.",PMC2895587,PMC2895587_3
"The immune system of a human subject is not entirely reflected by its blood profile obtained at the steady state, as the immune system's capacity to respond to innate as well as antigen-specific immune signals may also provide useful and complementary information. Blood transcriptome profiling is being used to provide this complementary information, in addition to that obtained from whole blood profiles. The approach is being used",PMC2895587,PMC2895587_4
