"Abcb1 rs1045642 mutations reduce the occurrence of steroid-induced osteonecrosis, and this protective effect becomes more pronounced with increasing steroid dose.",PMC6522878,PMC6522878_0
"Apob rs693 and rs1042031 mutations increase the risk of steroid-induced osteonecrosis, and this correlation is present in patients treated with both prednisone and methylprednisolone, as well as in renal transplant patients.",PMC6522878,PMC6522878_1
"Pai-1 rs1799768 mutations have a protective effect against steroid-induced osteonecrosis, and this effect persists in patients treated with prednisone and renal transplant patients.",PMC6522878,PMC6522878_2
The abcb1 rs2032582 mutant has a protective effect against steroid-induced osteonecrosis in methylprednisolone/prednisone-treated renal transplant patients.,PMC6522878,PMC6522878_3
"The cumulative steroid dose and treatment duration have little effect on the results, and there is a dose-effect correlation for abcb1 rs1045642 and rs2032582 mutation carriers.",PMC6522878,PMC6522878_4
