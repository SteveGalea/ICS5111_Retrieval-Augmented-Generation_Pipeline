"This study reports the first outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) with evidence of horizontal transmission of a disease-associated feline coronavirus (FCoV), causing a high mortality rate (28%) in a closed multi-cat environment.",PMC3720556,PMC3720556_0
"The outbreak was caused by viruses from the same origin, as all FIP-associated FCoV infections involved a type II FCoV infection, and the recombination sites of the type II FCoV viruses currently available in GenBank, FCoV 79-1146, FCoV 79-1683, and FCoV ntu156, were all unique and occurred independently.",PMC3720556,PMC3720556_1
"Horizontal transmission of FIP occurred at the onset and terminal stage of the disease, as shedding of type II FCoV through fecal and nasal/oral/conjunctival routes could be detected in effusive form FIP up to six days before death.",PMC3720556,PMC3720556_2
"The mortality rate of FIP can still be high in a closed multi-cat environment as long as the spread of the disease-associated FCoV remains undetected, as three of the FIP cats in this shelter were infected with both type I and type II FCoV.",PMC3720556,PMC3720556_3
"Isolation of diseased cats should be taken into consideration in a multi-cat environment, as all FCoV-positive cats in this outbreak were housed together at the very beginning, and after seven cats succumbed sequentially, all FCoV-positive cats were caged individually, and kept separated, and the isolation eventually terminated the transmission of the disease.",PMC3720556,PMC3720556_4
