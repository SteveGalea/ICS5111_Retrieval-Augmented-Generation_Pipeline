"The study shows that the s protein of the emerging mers-CoV is sensitive to inhibition by IFITM proteins, which are involved in the regulation of endosomal cholesterol.",PMC4189045,PMC4189045_0
The study provides evidence that human coronaviruses 229E and NL63 may be more susceptible to IFITM protein inhibition than the emerging SARS and MERS CoVs.,PMC4189045,PMC4189045_1
The study suggests that mechanisms other than accumulation of endosomal cholesterol may be responsible for the inhibition of S protein- and Fluav-ha-driven entry by IFITM proteins.,PMC4189045,PMC4189045_2
The study demonstrates that cellular entry driven by the S protein of the novel MERS-CoV is inhibited by IFITM proteins.,PMC4189045,PMC4189045_3
"The study highlights that human coronaviruses NL63 and 229E are inhibited by IFITM proteins to a greater extent than SARS and MERS CoVs, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for these emerging viruses.",PMC4189045,PMC4189045_4
