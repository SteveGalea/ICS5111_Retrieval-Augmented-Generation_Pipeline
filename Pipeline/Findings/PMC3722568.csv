"A novel locus associated with variability in plasma vWF levels has been identified through a charge gwas meta-analysis. The locus, clec4m, is a calcium-dependent, mannose-specific carbohydrate domain-containing receptor encoded by a gene on chromosome 19p13. The locus contributes to viral infectivity through endocytosis or presentation to circulating T cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells, depending on the ligand. Polymorphisms in clec4m, which is expressed on endothelial cells within the liver sinusoids and lymph nodes, affect vWF binding and internalization.",PMC3722568,PMC3722568_0
"Clec4m binds vWF in a glycan-dependent manner, with a 75% decrease in binding and internalization of vWF relative to cells expressing clec4m with 7 vntr alleles. The vntr polymorphism in the neck region of clec4m mediates differences in vWF binding and internalization in vitro.",PMC3722568,PMC3722568_1
Hydrodynamic gene transfer in mice demonstrated that clec4m expression in hepatocytes is associated with a 46% decrease in plasma levels of vWF:ag. This finding is consistent with previous reports that showed similar conflicting findings.,PMC3722568,PMC3722568_2
"Shear stress mediated by flowing blood will affect vWF conformation, as the clec4m crd is hinged or flexibly linked to the neck region.",PMC3722568,PMC3722568_3
"The clec4m vntr polymorphism mediates differences in vWF binding and internalization in vitro, but whether this influence also contributes to variability in plasma vWF levels is unclear and warrants further investigation.",PMC3722568,PMC3722568_4
