"The analysis of 10 years of clinical trials.gov data revealed that id trials are well represented in the overall clinical research landscape, but the distribution of studies is not consistent with the US or global burden of disease. This highlights the discrepancy between the market forces that drive drug development and where clinical need may actually be greatest.",PMC6598302,PMC6598302_0
"The analysis found that hepatitis C trials were overrepresented compared with global and US mortality and disability rates, possibly because of the greater burden of certain IDs in children. This suggests that some of the overrepresentation of hepatitis C could have been averted through greater collaboration of industry, funding sources, and researchers.",PMC6598302,PMC6598302_1
"The analysis showed that lrti trials continued to be underrepresented, constituting only 6.6% of the ID studies registered and 35.8% of infection-related global deaths. This indicates that resources are being invested disproportionately across the ID spectrum, and a multiple-stakeholder approach to funding that incorporates the perspectives of industry, funding agencies, and policy makers may be better able to direct how resources are allocated and research areas prioritized such that public health needs are better matched to the market forces that drive much of the clinical trial enterprise.",PMC6598302,PMC6598302_2
"The analysis found that malaria, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, childhood cluster diseases, and meningitis were also underrepresented compared with their very low prevalences in the US. This suggests that resources are being invested disproportionately across the ID spectrum, and a multiple-stakeholder approach to funding that incorporates the perspectives of industry, funding agencies, and policy makers may be better able to direct how resources are allocated and research areas prioritized such that public health needs are better matched to the market forces that drive much of the clinical trial enterprise.",PMC6598302,PMC6598302_3
"The analysis showed that trial sponsors are generally focused on their respective studies and do not examine the entire portfolio of interventional ID research. This highlights the need for a more holistic approach to ID research that considers the broader public health impact of interventions and the need for greater collaboration among industry, funding agencies, and policy makers to ensure that resources are allocated and research areas prioritized in a way that better aligns with public health needs.",PMC6598302,PMC6598302_4
