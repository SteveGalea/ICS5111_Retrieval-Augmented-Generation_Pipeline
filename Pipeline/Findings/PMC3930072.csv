"The authors found that both sars-cov and hcov-hku1 s proteins activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) in infected cells, but only sars-cov s1 fragment, but not its counterpart in hcov-hku1, is required and sufficient for UPR activation.",PMC3930072,PMC3930072_0
"The authors also observed that while sars-cov s proteins are capable of cleaving both sars-cov and hcov-hku1 s proteins, tmprss2 protease, which is present in sars-cov-infected cells, is unable to cleave hcov-hku1 s protein.",PMC3930072,PMC3930072_1
"The authors demonstrated that sars-cov and hcov-hku1 s proteins activate ER stress and the UPR, but only the s1 fragment of sars-cov s protein is indispensable for UPR activation in hcov-hku1-infected cells.",PMC3930072,PMC3930072_2
"The authors showed that the upr-modulating property of s proteins is highly selective and in the benefit of the viruses, as while sars-cov and hcov-hku1 s proteins activate ER stress and the UPR, only sars-cov s1 fragment is required and sufficient for UPR activation in hcov-hku1-infected cells.",PMC3930072,PMC3930072_3
"The authors found that while the sars-cov s protein is capable of cleaving both sars-cov and hcov-hku1 s proteins, tmprss2 protease, which is present in sars-cov-infected cells, is unable to cleave hcov-hku1 s protein.",PMC3930072,PMC3930072_4
