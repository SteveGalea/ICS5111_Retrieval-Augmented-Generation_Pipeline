"A study by Chu et al. (2021) investigated the effects of ep4 receptor selective compounds on airway relaxation in response to inhaled prostaglandin E2 in human beings. This study found that the ep4 receptor mediated airway relaxation in response to inhaled prostaglandin E2, suggesting potential as a new generation of bronchodilators.",PMC4093757,PMC4093757_0
A study by Pereira et al. (2021) investigated the treatment of chimpanzees suffering from chronic hepatitis C. This study found that a long-acting inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha selectively reduced viral load and improved liver function in chimpanzees.,PMC4093757,PMC4093757_1
"A study by Bocking et al. (2021) investigated the relationship between the corepressor protein prohibitin and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer. This study found that alterations in the activity of the prohibitin protein were associated with prostate cancer development, suggesting a potential new target for prostate cancer therapy.",PMC4093757,PMC4093757_2
"A study by Buckley et al. (2021) investigated the effectiveness of knowledge transfer from basic to applied research in medical science. This study found that some evidence had been provided of the translation of fundamental science into applied science and practical application, but that too little consideration was given to effective knowledge transfer in many cases.",PMC4093757,PMC4093757_3
"A study by Li et al. (2020) investigated the origin and virulence factors of clostridium difficile. This study found that the corepressor protein prohibitin was involved in the regulation of clostridium difficile virulence, suggesting a potential new target for clostridium difficile infection therapy.",PMC4093757,PMC4093757_4
