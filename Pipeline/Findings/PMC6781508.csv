"In the context of viral infections, the use of the syrian hamster model has revealed similarities to the human immune response, making it a highly effective and relevant platform for evaluating molecular mechanisms of immune responses to infectious diseases. This is particularly true for pathogens such as dengue virus, influenza virus, and norovirus, where the syrian hamster model has demonstrated the ability to recapitulate key aspects of the human disease pathogenesis.",PMC6781508,PMC6781508_0
"In the context of bacterial infections, the syrian hamster model has been used to study the pathogenesis of diseases caused by bacteria such as Salmonella, Listeria, and Helicobacter. This model has shown that the syrian hamster immune response is more physiological and similar to the human immune response when compared to other animal models, making it a valuable tool for drug and treatment discovery.",PMC6781508,PMC6781508_1
"In the context of parasitic infections, the syrian hamster model has been successfully used to study diseases caused by pathogens such as Leishmania and Entamoeba histolytica. This model has shown that it can recapitulate key aspects of the human disease pathogenesis, including the induction of type II cytokines and downregulation of IL-12.",PMC6781508,PMC6781508_2
"In the context of infectious diseases caused by viruses, the use of the syrian hamster model has allowed for the identification of key immune response mechanisms. For example, the model has been used to study the role of type I interferons (IFNs) in the antiviral response and to investigate the mechanisms of viral replication and clearance.",PMC6781508,PMC6781508_3
"In the context of bacterial infections, the syrian hamster model has been used to study the role of innate immune responses in bacterial clearance. This has included the investigation of the role of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and the identification of bacterial factors that contribute to the virulence of pathogenic bacteria.",PMC6781508,PMC6781508_4
