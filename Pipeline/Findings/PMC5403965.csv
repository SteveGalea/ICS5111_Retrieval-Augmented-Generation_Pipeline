"The small transmembrane proteins 90k, ifitm1-3, and members of the serinc protein family can all reduce the particle infectivity of HIV-1 by modifying the essential particle composition or by incorporating into nascent virions, respectively.",PMC5403965,PMC5403965_0
"The antiviral effect of 90k and ifitm proteins is more obvious when expressed in infected donor cells that transmit the virus to ifitm-negative target cells, as they are incorporated into membranes of nascent virions and decrease their particle infectivity by impairing fusion.",PMC5403965,PMC5403965_1
"In the context of other viruses, multiple, partially contradicting models have been debated regarding the mode of action of virus-associated ifitm proteins, including inhibition of viral membrane fusogenicity, restriction of viral membrane hemifusion, disruption of cholesterol homeostasis, and exclusion and inclusion of yet to be defined specific cellular factors with antiviral activity.",PMC5403965,PMC5403965_2
"Nef-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 particle infectivity requires its expression in the producer cell, is highly conserved within primate lentiviruses, and is maintained during disease progression. Nef is also incorporated into virus particles and cleaved by HIV-1 protease during maturation of particles. Its membrane association may be sufficient to result in virion packaging, as nef is also found in orthologous retroviruses when co-expressed in the producer cell.",PMC5403965,PMC5403965_3
"The antiviral activity of serinc proteins is caused predominantly by post-entry defects, as expression of serinc3 and serinc5 are not induced or stimulated by type I interferons, in contrast to the targets of most other viral antagonists. Serinc5 inhibition acts specifically against env-containing particles, as vsv-g pseudotypes were largely insensitive to serinc5. Nef was shown to counteract serinc activity by downregulating it from the cell surface via clathrin-dependent endocytosis and sequestering it in endosomes, thus precluding their incorporation into virion particles.",PMC5403965,PMC5403965_4
