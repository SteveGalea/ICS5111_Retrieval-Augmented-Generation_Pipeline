"Licl, a small molecule compound with inhibitory activity against tgev replication, is effective in preventing infection by coronaviruses from different species, including tgev, a porcine coronavirus, and ibv, an avian coronavirus.",PMC3089605,PMC3089605_0
"Licl inhibits rna-dependent rna polymerases, which are characteristic of positive and negative-stranded rna viruses, including coronaviruses tgev and ibv.",PMC3089605,PMC3089605_1
"Licl inhibits plaque formation of virus-infected cells, indicating that the inhibition of licl occurs during the whole viral replication after infection.",PMC3089605,PMC3089605_2
Licl decreases tgev-induced apoptosis in infected cells via exerting an anti-apoptotic effect mediated by caspase 3-related pathways.,PMC3089605,PMC3089605_3
Licl does not directly interact with or inactivate tgev particles and is ineffective when pre-incubated with host cells.,PMC3089605,PMC3089605_4
