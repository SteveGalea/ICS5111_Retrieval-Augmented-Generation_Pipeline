"After direct administration to the lung, ps-lna aso accumulates in lung macrophages but does not exhibit activity, while nonphosphorothioated oligos carry a risk of toll-like receptor 3, 7, and 8 activation, potentially leading to immunostimulation.",PMC3242665,PMC3242665_0
"Intratracheally administered phosphorothioate lna antisense (ps-lna) is rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation and accumulates in liver and kidney, but not in lung cells or tissues.",PMC3242665,PMC3242665_1
"In contrast to ps-lna aso, lna aso, which is refractory to immune activation, exhibits activity in the liver after i.v. administration.",PMC3242665,PMC3242665_2
"Sirna and lna aso, administered via the lung, are not readily taken up by lung cells or tissues but are instead rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation and eliminated via the renal route.",PMC3242665,PMC3242665_3
"After i.v. administration, lna aso accumulates in liver and kidney tissues, resulting in significant knockdown of the target mRNA.",PMC3242665,PMC3242665_4
