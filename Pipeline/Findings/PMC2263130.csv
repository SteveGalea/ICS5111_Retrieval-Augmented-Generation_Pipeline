"In the context of identifying cross-reactive T cell epitopes in HIV-1, the authors found that the majority of predicted HIV-1 epitopes were not recognized by T cells specific for the corresponding wild-type epitopes, with only 33 out of 87 predicted hla-a2 restricted HIV-1 epitopes being confirmed as T cell epitopes.",PMC2263130,PMC2263130_0
"In the context of identifying human self-antigens, the authors found that the maximal similarity between predicted HIV-1 antigens and the set of human self-antigens was always less than 1, as no identical matches were found between HIV-1 epitopes and human self-antigens.",PMC2263130,PMC2263130_1
"In the context of measuring T cell responses to HIV-1, the authors found that the relative frequency of recognition of a peptide y resembling a reference peptide x in terms of the number and magnitude of conservative substitutions was captured by the asymmetry of the peptide-similarity score s(a,b).",PMC2263130,PMC2263130_2
"In the context of predicting HIV-1 epitopes, the authors found that four out of the 91 predicted HIV-1 epitopes were immunogenic for other supertypes than hla-a2, with these peptides being filtered out in the prediction of hla-a2 restricted HIV-1 epitopes.",PMC2263130,PMC2263130_3
"In the context of predicting human self-antigens, the authors found that the human proteome contained 34,460 protein sequences, with 230,460 predicted human hla-a2 restricted self-antigens each of length 9.",PMC2263130,PMC2263130_4
