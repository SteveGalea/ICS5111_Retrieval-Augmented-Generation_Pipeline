"In the aftermath of World War II, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was established to provide assistance to displaced persons (DPs) in Europe. UNRRA's focus on DPs was driven by the recognition that many people were displaced from their homes as a result of the war, and that they required assistance to rebuild their lives.",PMC2866594,PMC2866594_0
"UNRRA's efforts to address the health needs of DPs led to the development of a comprehensive program that included measures to prevent and control epidemics, such as vaccination, water and sanitation, and vector control. UNRRA's program was successful in reducing the incidence of epidemics among DPs.",PMC2866594,PMC2866594_1
"In some UNRRA camps, compulsory examinations for venereal diseases (VD) were conducted among female DPs. UNRRA officials, including camp doctors and medical officers, expressed concerns about the necessity, legality, and morality of these examinations, as they believed that the incidence of VD among female DPs was already low. They also believed that these examinations were discriminatory against female DPs.",PMC2866594,PMC2866594_2
"UNRRA officials at both the central and regional levels refused to comply with military government instructions to conduct VD examinations among DPs, as they believed that these examinations were unnecessary and discriminatory. However, some camps complied with these measures voluntarily, as they believed that DPs were indeed at risk for VD.",PMC2866594,PMC2866594_3
"UNRRA's efforts to address the health needs of DPs also contributed to the emancipation of DPs from national restrictions, as UNRRA recognized DPs as subjects of an international community. This recognition helped to mitigate the challenges of respecting or transcending national sovereignty in the context of global health threats. UNRRA's humanitarian motives in the fight against global health threats were more fruitful to international organizations than purely utilitarian rhetoric.",PMC2866594,PMC2866594_4
