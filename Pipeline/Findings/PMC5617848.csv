"In a study by Uzun et al. (2017), copd patients with bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) had higher sputum eosinophils than those without BHR, and the change in FEV1 was positively correlated with sputum eosinophils in patients with bronchial reversibility (N = 115).",PMC5617848,PMC5617848_0
"In a study by Zanini et al. (2014), the prevalence of elevated serum IgE was 47.3% in copd patients, and serum IgE levels were associated with copd severity.",PMC5617848,PMC5617848_1
"In a study by Zhang et al. (2018), copd patients with bronchiectasis had a higher incidence of bacterial colonization (42%), and the risk factors included diagnosis of bronchiectasis before the age of 14 years, FEV1 <80% predicted, and the presence of varicose or cystic bronchiectasis.",PMC5617848,PMC5617848_2
"In a study by Uzun et al. (2014), blood eosinophils were proposed to be a surrogate marker for airway eosinophilia in stable copd, and copd patients with blood eosinophils â‰¥2% treated with inhaled corticosteroid/LABA had significantly fewer exacerbations than those treated with LABA alone or placebo.",PMC5617848,PMC5617848_3
"In a study by Zhang et al. (2019), cpap was reported to significantly reduce the incidence of exacerbations (HR, 0.73) and improve the quality of life among copd patients, and azithromycin 500 mg taken 3 times a week for 12 months resulted in a significant reduction in the exacerbation rate versus placebo (HR, 0.58) among copd patients who had 3 or more exacerbations in the previous year.",PMC5617848,PMC5617848_4
