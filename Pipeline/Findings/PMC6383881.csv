"The study demonstrated effective results in the inactivation of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses spiked into commercially collected animal plasma using a uv-c turbulator system. The enveloped viruses, including prrsv, bvdv, and pedv, were more susceptible to uv-c irradiation than non-enveloped viruses, such as ppv, svdv, and pcv-2. This difference was observed at lower uv-c doses, with enveloped viruses requiring lower doses for inactivation compared to non-enveloped viruses.",PMC6383881,PMC6383881_0
"The study found that the inactivation curve for ppv, a non-enveloped virus, demonstrated a minimal residual level of ppv at the highest dose (9000 j/l), while subsequent passages detected very low residual viral infectivity, suggesting the presence of a resistant viral subpopulation.",PMC6383881,PMC6383881_1
The study found that uv-c inactivation of liquid plasma during the manufacturing process for sdap has a potential application for inactivation of microbial contaminants without causing negative effects on the nutritional or physical qualities of the treated material.,PMC6383881,PMC6383881_2
"The study found that the uv-c mechanism of inactivation (dna or rna damage) is different than the thermal inactivation provided by the spray-drying step. In consequence, the uv-c step can be considered independent from the spray-drying process and may be a synergistic process as both procedures have different inactivation targets.",PMC6383881,PMC6383881_3
"The study found that obtained results with viruses evaluated in this study suggest that uv-c inactivation susceptibility of both types of viral genome (dsDNA and ssRNA) was similar, and the longer genome size did not appear to increase virus susceptibility to uv-c radiation when spiked into commercially collected animal plasma and exposed to uv-c. However, a weak linear trend (r2 = 0.43) was found in the current data when comparing genome size to the 4d of viruses (without outlierâ€™s results pedv and prv).",PMC6383881,PMC6383881_4
