"Cypa, a protein vital for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) lytic infection, reactivation, and latency establishment, serves as a potential target for HCMV treatment.",PMC6243413,PMC6243413_0
"Cypa interacts with cyclin A (Cd147), a CDK regulatory protein, to mediate HCMV replication and inhibit immune response, and its expression is core to the determination of whether cyclosporin A (CSA), an immunosuppressive drug commonly used in organ transplantations, activates or suppresses virus proliferation.",PMC6243413,PMC6243413_1
"Cypa is involved in inflammatory response and interacts with HL-A and HL-Ag, enabling viruses to evade the immune response, and its expression is associated with the formation of the CSA-Cypa complex that suppresses organ rejection by inhibiting calcium/calmodulin-dependent and calcineurin (CSA).",PMC6243413,PMC6243413_2
"Cypa is a target for HCMV gene expression and reproduction, as the ie2 expression, encoded by the HCMV ie gene ul122, depends on which proteins or cellular signals it interacts with during the cascade of events, and is core to the determination of whether CSA activates or suppresses virus proliferation.",PMC6243413,PMC6243413_3
"Cypa is a major intermediate early protein (ie2) that mediates HCMV lytic cycle, and its expression is most effective in early stages of the viral replication cycle, when the immune and inflammatory responses are still limited, making it a crucial target for HCMV treatment.",PMC6243413,PMC6243413_4
