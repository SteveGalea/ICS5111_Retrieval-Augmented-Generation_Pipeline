"The authors have developed a single silicon-glass microchip for the simultaneous detection of multiple target analytes, including both Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) species, using a thermal cell lysis, magnetic particle-based target genome isolation, asymmetric polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and electrochemical sequence-specific amplicons detection methodology.",PMC1636451,PMC1636451_0
"The authors have demonstrated the successful isolation of the genome with the magnetic particle-based approach, compatibility of the magnetic particle with the PCR process, and thermal stability of the immobilized detection capture probe through the temperature cycling process, as well as negligible nonspecific adsorption on the electrode surface.",PMC1636451,PMC1636451_1
"The authors have shown that the selective immobilization of capture probes using the pyrrole-based electropolymerization process provides good thermal stability and PCR process compatibility, which are crucial for the multiplexed analysis.",PMC1636451,PMC1636451_2
"The authors have presented a calibration plot of the sample-to-background ratio against the logarithmic number of E. Coli cells in the sample, which confirms the successful detection of the target species.",PMC1636451,PMC1636451_3
"The authors have shown that the selective immobilization of capture probes using the pyrrole-based electropolymerization process provides good compatibility with other processes, such as the PCR process, which are crucial for the multiplexed analysis.",PMC1636451,PMC1636451_4
