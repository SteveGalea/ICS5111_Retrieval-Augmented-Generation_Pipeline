In vitro-activated CD8+ T cells express elevated levels of the antiviral protein IFITM3 in the absence of interferon signaling.,PMC6334895,PMC6334895_0
"IFITM3 is upregulated on effector T cells in vivo during influenza virus infection, which confers a survival advantage and increases their resistance to infection.",PMC6334895,PMC6334895_1
"Intranasal infection with influenza virus or treatment with an inflammatory agent (LPS) results in equivalent ratios of WT and IFITM3 KO CD8+ T cells in the spleen, but in the lung, only WT CD8+ T cells are detected, indicating that IFITM3 KO CD8+ T cells are at a disadvantage at the site of infection.",PMC6334895,PMC6334895_2
"IFITM3 can be upregulated on T cells independent of interferon signaling, which could represent a broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutic approach providing antiviral resistance with minimal side effects.",PMC6334895,PMC6334895_3
"The upregulation of IFITM3 on T cells infiltrating the site of infection provides these cells a survival advantage allowing them to mediate their effector functions without becoming a target for infection, which could be harnessed as an antiviral therapeutic approach providing the coveted antiviral actions of IFITM3 while avoiding the undesirable, pleiotropic effects of interferon treatment.",PMC6334895,PMC6334895_4
