"Differential expression patterns of antiviral genes rig-1, pkr, oas1, mx1, and mx2 were observed in ipec-j2 cells following pedv infection.",PMC7040077,PMC7040077_0
"The expressions of rig-1, pkr, oas1, mx1, and mx2 were significantly and positively correlated with each other during pedv infection.",PMC7040077,PMC7040077_1
"The expressions of antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced within 0â€“4 h post-infection, but all antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated from 12 to 24 h, and cytopathic changes were observed during this period.",PMC7040077,PMC7040077_2
The expression levels of antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were positively correlated with the severity of the cytopathic effect following pedv infection of ipec-j2 cells.,PMC7040077,PMC7040077_3
The study suggests that the expressions of antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines are important indicators for clarifying the pathogenesis of pedv infection and the associated host immune mechanisms.,PMC7040077,PMC7040077_4
