"The study reports the rapid cloning and purification of the nc protein fragment from yeast cells, which demonstrates highly specific immuno-response in sera from sars patients.",PMC5172413,PMC5172413_0
"The elisa analysis of the nc fusion protein shows that it can specifically distinguish sars patient sera from those of normal controls, providing a potential diagnostic tool for sars.",PMC5172413,PMC5172413_1
The study suggests that the n protein fragment may be of great potential in designing clinical diagnostic tools for sars due to its highly specific immuno-response in sars patient sera.,PMC5172413,PMC5172413_2
The n protein fragment may become a candidate for a vaccine against sars due to its highly specific immuno-response in sars patient sera.,PMC5172413,PMC5172413_3
"The study highlights the potential advantages of using the nc protein fragment for designing diagnostic tools and vaccines against sars, such as the simplified cloning procedures, the preservation of posttranslational modifications, and the ability to overcome potential issues with whole virus lysates in large-scale production of antigens and vaccines.",PMC5172413,PMC5172413_4
