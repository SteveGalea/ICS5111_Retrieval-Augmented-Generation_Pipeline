"Strongyloides stercoralis infection is common in tropical and subtropical countries, with an estimated 370 million people infected worldwide.",PMC5040796,PMC5040796_0
"Hyperinfection syndrome, a severe and fatal dissease, occurs in immunocompromised patients, particularly in those with corticosteroid use or HIV/AIDS, and is associated with a mortality rate of up to 100%.",PMC5040796,PMC5040796_1
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis or bronchiolitis and concurrent bacterial infection can present similarly to hyperinfection syndrome and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.,PMC5040796,PMC5040796_2
"Coinfection with human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) and strongyloides stercoralis is associated with decreased production of cytokines that participate in the host defense mechanism against helminths, leading to increased susceptibility to strongyloides stercoralis infection.",PMC5040796,PMC5040796_3
"Early diagnosis and treatment of strongyloides stercoralis infection are crucial, as the mortality rate of disseminated disease approaches 100% if left untreated. Serological methods, such as ELISA tests, are the most sensitive available diagnostic tools and should be maintained in all transplant centers to avoid this serious infection.",PMC5040796,PMC5040796_4
