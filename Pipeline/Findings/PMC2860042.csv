"In the context of neurologic complications of viral infections, one important finding is the increased incidence and burden of neurological diseases in resource-poor countries due to viral infections of the central nervous system. This finding is highlighted in the section on viral diseases of the central nervous system, where it is noted that many viruses, such as rabies, herpes simplex virus, dengue, hiv, and hcv, can cause neurological disease in addition to their primary targets. In some cases, such as in the context of hcv infection, the incidence of neurological complications is increased in immunosuppressed individuals due to hcv or antiretroviral treatment of hiv infection.",PMC2860042,PMC2860042_0
"Another important finding in this context is the potential for neurological complications to be under-diagnosed and under-reported, particularly in resource-poor settings, due to a lack of access to neuroimaging facilities and neurologists. This finding is discussed in relation to the neurological complications of measles, where it is noted that the autoimmune disease, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and the progressive cns infection subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, which are relatively rare but potentially under-reported, may have different epidemiology in developing countries compared to developed countries.",PMC2860042,PMC2860042_1
"A third important finding is the increased risk of neurological disease in individuals with immunosuppression due to hiv infection or treatment with immunomodulatory drugs for other diseases. This finding is discussed in relation to opportunistic infections associated with hiv infection, as well as reactivation of previously controlled infections due to profound immunosuppression.",PMC2860042,PMC2860042_2
"A fourth important finding is the potential for neurological complications to contribute to the increased burden of neurological disease in resource-poor countries due to viral infections of the central nervous system. This finding is highlighted in the context of viral diseases of the central nervous system, where it is noted that many viruses, such as rabies, herpes simplex virus, dengue, hiv, and hcv, can cause neurological disease in addition to their primary targets, and that the incidence of neurological complications may be increased in immunosuppressed individuals due to h",PMC2860042,PMC2860042_3
