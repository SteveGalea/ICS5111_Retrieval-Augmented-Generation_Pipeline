"In the context of pandemic influenza preparedness, a study by Zimmer et al. (2010) found that some employment characteristics, such as inability to work from home and lack of paid sick leave, are associated with reports of experiencing serious financial problems if isolated from work over the 3 periods: 7–10 days, 1 month, and 3 months. Low- and middle-income workers were significantly more likely than high-income workers to report financial problems in all 3 periods. The study also found that workers living in urban areas were more likely than those living in rural areas to fear job insecurity, which could pose substantial problems for pandemic influenza mitigation because those in urban areas may be strongly encouraged to remain isolated to avoid virus spread in conditions of population density and crowding.",PMC2958001,PMC2958001_0
"In the context of pandemic influenza mitigation, findings from a study by Zimmer et al. (2010) suggest that working with employers to ensure work-from-home or sick leave capabilities for nonessential employees and planning to provide state or federal supplementary income support and job protection for workers who would not be paid if they missed work because of official pandemic mitigation recommendations could increase the likelihood of compliance with isolation recommendations. These strategies could include working with employers to ensure work-from-home or sick leave capabilities for nonessential employees and planning to provide state or federal supplementary income support and job protection for workers who would not be paid if they missed work because of official pandemic mitigation recommendations.",PMC2958001,PMC2958001_1
"In the context of pandemic influenza mitigation, the study by Zimmer et al. (2010) found that low- and middle-income workers would have more difficulty complying with isolation recommendations than would upper-income groups, particularly at 3 months’ of isolation, when persons from all income levels, especially low-income, would likely experience serious financial problems.",PMC2958001,PMC2958001_2
"In the context of pandemic influenza mitigation, the study by Zimmer et al. (2010) suggested that an existing mechanism for delivering financial support to affected persons, such as unemployment insurance, could be used to disperse lump-sum payments to those financially affected by a pandemic, if the severity of an outbreak warranted isolation from the workplace for long periods.",PMC2958001,PMC2958001_3
