"Rvd, a recently recognized group of avian rotaviruses, is emerging as a significant cause of runting and stunting syndrome in poultry.",PMC5750577,PMC5750577_0
"Rvd is prevalent in both symptomatic and asymptomatic birds, suggesting that it may have different pathogenicities depending on the virulence of the particular strain or environmental factors.",PMC5750577,PMC5750577_1
"Rvd has been detected in poultry flocks from various countries, including Europe, Asia, and Africa, with an increasing prevalence in recent years.",PMC5750577,PMC5750577_2
"Rvd can be distinguished from other avian rotavirus groups by its migration pattern in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which shows a pattern of 5:2:2:2 for rvd, compared to 5:1:3:2 for avian rotavirus-a and 4:1:2:2:2 for rvd, rvf, and rvg.",PMC5750577,PMC5750577_3
"Prevention of rvd spread in poultry flocks is currently limited to maintaining good sanitation and hygiene, as no vaccines are available for rvd prevention, and further studies are required to understand host-pathogen interactions, virulence factors, and the development of specific treatment options.",PMC5750577,PMC5750577_4
