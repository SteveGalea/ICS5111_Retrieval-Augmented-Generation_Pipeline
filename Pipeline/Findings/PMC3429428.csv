"The crystal structure of lassa np, an exonuclease from the arenavirus family of viruses, reveals two residues outside the catalytic site that are critical for binding to and processing RNA. The first, Y429, is the only residue that is essential for exonuclease activity and is involved in binding to the non-substrate strand. Mutation of Y429 to alanine or leucine allows binding but greatly inhibits the digestion of RNA. The second, G392, provides specificity for RNA within the active site and is completely conserved among all arenaviruses and also the coronaviruses.",PMC3429428,PMC3429428_0
"The structure of lassa np bound to RNA suggests a different mode of binding of double-stranded substrates compared to other exonucleases. Lassa np has a basic loop motif located in a projecting ""arm"" rather than above and to the right of the active site. This loop contains K516, K517, K518, and R519, although the side chains are disordered in this structure. Other arenaviruses, such as Junin and Machupo, have a histidine at this position, which could provide a similar interaction with RNA as a tyrosine.",PMC3429428,PMC3429428_1
"The crystal structure of lassa np reveals clashes would likely occur between the protein and B-form DNA when modeling a B-form DNA substrate. However, there do not appear to be any clashes when modeling an A-form ssDNA substrate as part of a hybrid RNA:DNA substrate. Lassa np can only efficiently bind to and process A-form ssDNA substrates.",PMC3429428,PMC3429428_2
"Mutation of G392 to alanine disrupts both the exonuclease function and the immunosuppressive function of np. The position of the main-chain nitrogen afforded by the uniquely flexible glycine seems to be important for proper orientation of the 3' nucleotide of an incoming RNA strand relative to critical residues of the active site. Mutation of this residue to anything other than glycine would result in φ and ψ backbone dihedral angles outside allowable regions, unless several surrounding residues, including the active site D38",PMC3429428,PMC3429428_3
