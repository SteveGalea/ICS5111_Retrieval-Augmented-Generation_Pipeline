"The study found that the fungal cell wall component β-glucan, when conjugated to crt, a fungal cell wall component, can induce anti-β-glucan antibodies in mice, rabbits, and rats without the need for T cell help. This finding is significant because it highlights the potential of crt as a carrier protein in glycoconjugate vaccine formulation, as it allows for the bypassing of T cell help in eliciting target antigen-specific IgG production, implying effectiveness in protecting hosts whose acquired immune system is impaired.",PMC3623425,PMC3623425_0
"The study showed that crt, when conjugated to lam-crt, a β-glucan-derived molecule, could significantly enhance the humoral response to laminarin in mice. This finding is important because it suggests that lam-crt, when conjugated to other fungus-encapsulating polysaccharides, could also enhance humoral responses in healthy mice, potentially eliminating the need for additional adjuvants in vaccine formulation.",PMC3623425,PMC3623425_1
"The study found that the lam-crt-induced IgG response was significantly higher in mice than in t-cell-deficient nude mice. This finding is significant because it suggests that crt-mediated adjuvanticity is not dependent on T cell help, highlighting the potential of crt as a carrier protein in glycoconjugate vaccine formulation.",PMC3623425,PMC3623425_2
"The study showed that intraperitoneal administration of rcrt/39-272, a crt-derived molecule, effectively modulated cell-mediated immunity and suppressed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, which is attributed to its chaperoning properties. This finding is important because it suggests that rcrt/39-272 could greatly improve the immunogenicity of β-glucans in healthy mice, potentially eliminating the need for additional adjuvants in vaccine formulation.",PMC3623425,PMC3623425_3
"The study found that crt, when conjugated to rcrt/39-272, a fungal cell wall component, could significantly enhance the humoral response to laminarin in mice, and the lam-crt-induced I",PMC3623425,PMC3623425_4
