The study reports the discovery that the main protease (Mpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) exists in both monomeric and a dimeric form in solution.,PMC2762595,PMC2762595_0
"The authors have solved the structures of both forms of Mpro-C, which is the C-terminal domain of Mpro, and found that the dimer structure is a 3D domain-swapped dimer.",PMC2762595,PMC2762595_1
"The dimer structure is stable and does not exchange with the monomer form, indicating that forming domain-swapped dimers is an intrinsic ability of Mpro-C.",PMC2762595,PMC2762595_2
"The study also found that the n-finger of Mpro may interfere and prevent the 3D domain-swapping dimerization of the c-terminal domain of Mpro, suggesting that the full-length Mpro may not form a domain-swapped dimer.",PMC2762595,PMC2762595_3
"The authors pose questions about why the virus retains the c-terminal domain within Mpro, which has the potential to deactivate the enzyme, and whether the two n-terminal domains of the dimer would be far away and prevent the domain-swapped dimer from adopting the active conformation.",PMC2762595,PMC2762595_4
