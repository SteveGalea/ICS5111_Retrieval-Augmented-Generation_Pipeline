A novel amirna-based therapy against the emerging jev virus has been developed using vector-delivered amirnas targeted against the conserved 3' untranslated region (UTR) of jev.,PMC6277082,PMC6277082_0
"The amirna-based therapy was found to efficiently inhibit jev replication in neuronal cells, with the amirna #2 seed sequence exhibiting the most significant inhibitory effect.",PMC6277082,PMC6277082_1
The amirna #2-mediated effect was sequence specific and did not induce an additional interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) response compared to control.,PMC6277082,PMC6277082_2
"The amirna #1-mediated effect as observed in the study may be the combined result of both sequences, specific as well as ISG-mediated response.",PMC6277082,PMC6277082_3
"The amirna-based therapy offers a proof of concept for the development of novel amirna-based therapeutics against emerging jev, due to the unique benefits provided by the polymerase-II-promoter-driven plasmid vector used, which provides comparatively less toxic RNAi molecules inside the cells.",PMC6277082,PMC6277082_4
