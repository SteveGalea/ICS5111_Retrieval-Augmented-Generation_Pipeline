"The viral shedding pattern of SARS-CoV is different from that of other respiratory viruses, with respiratory shedding peaking during the second week and lasting for more than 6 weeks in some cases. Stool shedding also occurs later than expected, with the ability to detect virus in stool specimens peaking at the beginning of the second week and remaining high over weeks 3-4.",PMC3323215,PMC3323215_0
"The diagnostic yield of different specimen types varies for SARS-CoV, with throat washing samples being the most inferior respiratory specimens. Pooled throat and nasal swab specimens provide a higher diagnostic yield compared with nasopharyngeal aspirates. A combination of stool sample and pooled throat and nasal swab specimens should be the specimens of choice for a safe and high-yield SARS-CoV detection.",PMC3323215,PMC3323215_1
"SARS-CoV can survive for at least 2-4 days at room temperature when mixed with diarrheal or normal stool specimens, and the poor isolation rate from stool may be due to the presence of toxic substances in stool or rectal swab samples or the possibility of viral growth interference due to the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig)a antibodies.",PMC3323215,PMC3323215_2
"Positive virologic results are associated with more adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV patients, potentially confounded by the fact that only high-yield specimens, such as tracheal aspirate, can be obtained from intubated patients.",PMC3323215,PMC3323215_3
"The ability to accurately diagnose SARS-CoV infection needs improvement, with options including the inclusion of levels of viremia in the diagnostic algorithm, the development of a SARS-CoV-specific monoclonal antibody for detecting virus-infected cells from respiratory samples, and the development of an assay to detect viral antigens from stool samples as is available for rotavirus detection. The unusual shedding pattern of SARS-CoV should also be considered when formulating infection control strategies.",PMC3323215,PMC3323215_4
