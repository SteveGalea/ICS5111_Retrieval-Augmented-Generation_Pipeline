"Clostridium difficile, a food-borne pathogen, has been implicated in neonatal nec, sepsis, and meningitis. In gnotobiotic quails, strains of clostridium butyricum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile isolated from nec patients caused cecal lesions similar to those observed in nec, and nec did not occur if bifidobacteria were introduced along with clostridia. Therefore, the latter acted as opportunistic pathogens.",PMC3647029,PMC3647029_0
"C. Sakazakii, an emerging pathogen, has been implicated in neonatal nec, sepsis, and meningitis. In a well-established animal model, c. Sakazakii caused intestinal inflammation, and its virulence was strain-specific. Only 3 out of 24 strains induced barrier leakage, disrupted tight junctions, and induced enterocyte apoptosis. All of these three strains were of human origin, and strain-specific virulence may explain why the same microbial species may or may not cause the disease.",PMC3647029,PMC3647029_1
"In a study using a well-established animal model, a strain of K. Pneumoniae caused nec in neonatal mice. Development of nec in this model was dependent on chemical obliteration of the host's paneth cells, indicating that K. Pneumoniae acted as an opportunistic pathogen.",PMC3647029,PMC3647029_2
"In a study using a well-established animal model, c. Sakazakii, but not E. Coli, at 105 CFU significantly increased the degree of intestinal inflammation, reported as nec pathologic grade. The effect of c. Sakazakii was dose-dependent, and c. Sakazakii did not invade enterocytes, but efficiently adhered to the epithelium in vivo and in vitro, causing enterocyte apoptosis and destruction of the villus tips.",PMC3647029,PMC3647029_3
"In a study examining the pathogenicity of C. Sakazakii, it was demonstrated that the ability to cause epithelial damage in nec models is not a property of bacterial species as a whole, but rather a",PMC3647029,PMC3647029_4
