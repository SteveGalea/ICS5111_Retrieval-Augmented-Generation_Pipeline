Poor hygiene in housing leads to a lower total antioxidant capacity in all pigs and higher hydrogen peroxide levels in less efficient pigs (high RFI).,PMC6794813,PMC6794813_0
"In high RFI pigs, poor hygiene conditions activate antioxidant enzyme activities in adipose tissue and lead to higher thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentrations.",PMC6794813,PMC6794813_1
"After the resilience period, adipose tissue in pigs previously challenged by poor hygiene maintains higher antioxidant enzyme activities and higher thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentrations in high RFI pigs.",PMC6794813,PMC6794813_2
"In liver and muscle, there are only minor changes in antioxidant molecules due to genetics and hygiene conditions.",PMC6794813,PMC6794813_3
"Pigs selected for improved feed efficiency show a lower susceptibility to oxidative stress induced by poor hygiene conditions, which could lead to less impaired growth during sanitary challenges in production period.",PMC6794813,PMC6794813_4
