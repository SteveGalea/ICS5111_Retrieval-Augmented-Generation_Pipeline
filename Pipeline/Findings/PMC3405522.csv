"The study reports a novel real-time RT-PCR assay for rapid and sensitive detection and quantification of RSV A and B subgroups, as well as viral load.",PMC3405522,PMC3405522_0
"The assay uses LNA probes targeting the most conserved region of the N gene and an internal control virus (EAV) to monitor efficiency of RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification.",PMC3405522,PMC3405522_1
"The assay exhibits a diagnostic yield of 32%, which is higher than the yield of a commercial conventional multiplex PCR assay and the SEEPLEXâ„¢ RSV Detection Kit.",PMC3405522,PMC3405522_2
"The assay shows good analytical reproducibility, as evidenced by intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranging from 1% to 3%.",PMC3405522,PMC3405522_3
"The study confirms a negative correlation between RSV viral load and age, and significant differences in viral load between severe and non-severe patients, but when adjusted for age, these differences lose statistical significance.",PMC3405522,PMC3405522_4
