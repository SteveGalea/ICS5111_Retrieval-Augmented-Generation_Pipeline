"RNA recombination is a major driving force for RNA virus diversity, facilitating the emergence and evolution of new viral strains and variants.",PMC3607795,PMC3607795_0
"RNA recombination is a byproduct of RNA genome organization, acting on selected aspects of the virus life cycle and not necessarily favored by natural selection.",PMC3607795,PMC3607795_1
"RNA recombination is a key function during virus speciation and emergence, but its shared contribution that parallels other RNA modification pathways has not yet been assessed.",PMC3607795,PMC3607795_2
"RNA viruses can recombine with cellular RNAs, but the factors and mechanisms enabling such events, as well as the intracellular location of the RNA-RNA template switching, are not well understood.",PMC3607795,PMC3607795_3
"RNA viruses were found to recombine with cellular RNAs, but the exact steps and molecular mechanisms of the RNA viral sequence integration with the cellular DNA have not been fully elucidated.",PMC3607795,PMC3607795_4
