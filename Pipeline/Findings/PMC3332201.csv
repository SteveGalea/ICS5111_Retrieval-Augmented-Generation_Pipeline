"Viruses, including bacteriophages, can be visualized under an electron microscope due to their small size and simple composition. They can be found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.",PMC3332201,PMC3332201_0
"Bombyx mori cypovirus 1, a nonenveloped virus, enters the midgut cells of silkworms by recognizing and attaching to the plasma membrane of microvilli, resulting in membrane disruption and virion penetration through the microvilli.",PMC3332201,PMC3332201_1
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, an enveloped virus, enters Vero E6 cells by attaching to the cell surface and fusing its envelope with the cell membrane, allowing the nucleocapsids to enter the cell.",PMC3332201,PMC3332201_2
"Bacteriophages overcome the barrier of cell walls by releasing their genome into bacteria through the portal pore located at one vertex of the capsid, followed by the ejection of the inner core through the tail hub.",PMC3332201,PMC3332201_3
"Viruses take advantage of the structures of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells to enter them. Enveloped viruses enter cells by membrane fusion, while nonenveloped viruses enter through penetration and endocytosis vesicles. Bacteriophages use tails to bind to the cell and eject their genome into the host cell.",PMC3332201,PMC3332201_4
