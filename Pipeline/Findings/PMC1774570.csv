The authors report the first sequences of the orf4a/b region in clinical isolates of hcov-229e.,PMC1774570,PMC1774570_0
"Both types of deletions, 2 or 118 nucleotides, of the orf4 gene only in cell culture-adapted hcov-229e viruses create a frame shift that introduces an early termination codon, either separating orf4 to orf4a and orf4b or resulting in a truncated orf4(a) fragment (hc-lp).",PMC1774570,PMC1774570_1
"The amino acid sequence of the hcov-229e orf4 protein is highly conserved among clinical isolates, suggesting that the protein plays an important role during in vivo infection.",PMC1774570,PMC1774570_2
"Molecular clock analysis with the neighbor-joining method, kimura distances, and a bootstrap of 1000 replicates indicates that the divergence between the current clinical isolates and the early isolates most likely represents genetic drift over 20â€“30 years of evolution.",PMC1774570,PMC1774570_3
The authors report that the experimental data strongly support the hypothesis that a separation of a formerly single orf4 into orf4a and orf4b occurred upon adaptation of hcov-229e to cell culture.,PMC1774570,PMC1774570_4
