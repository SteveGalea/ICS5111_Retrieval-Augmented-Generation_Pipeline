"The study found that inhibition of the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in primary cultures of human leiomyoma cells decreased cell growth and proliferation in vitro, suggesting a critical role for this pathway in stem cell renewal and differentiation to the smooth-muscle phenotype observed in myometrial and leiomyoma tissues.",PMC4008647,PMC4008647_0
"The study revealed that components of the wnt pathway, such as frizzled receptors, are prime drug development targets, particularly the accessible plasma membrane receptors, as both canonical and noncanonical wnts may contribute to tumorigenesis.",PMC4008647,PMC4008647_1
"The study showed that expression of wnt4, an activator of β-catenin, is markedly elevated in leiomyoma with med12 mutations compared to those without mutations, indicating a mechanism involving med12 mutations and wnt/β-catenin activation that supports cell proliferation in uterine leiomyoma tissue.",PMC4008647,PMC4008647_2
"The study demonstrated that niclosamide and xav939, both of which inhibit wnt/β-catenin signaling, have antitumor effects on primary cultures of human leiomyoma cells in vitro, highlighting the down-regulation of wnt/β-catenin signaling as a potential target for new therapeutics in the treatment of uterine leiomyomas.",PMC4008647,PMC4008647_3
"The study suggests that cells serving as progenitors to leiomyoma may be a key target of wnt/β-catenin signaling in leiomyoma tumorigenesis, as wnt/β-catenin signaling controls cell-fate decisions throughout development, often controlling the balance between progenitor cells and their descendants.",PMC4008647,PMC4008647_4
