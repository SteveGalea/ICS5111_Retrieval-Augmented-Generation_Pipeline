"The study developed a novel ica for the qualitative detection of MERS-CoV antigen in dromedary camels, which was found to be rapid, sensitive, specific, and stable at room temperature.",PMC4365254,PMC4365254_0
"The assay developed here is considered satisfactory to be used for herd screening against MERS-CoV antigen across international borders, animal markets, and slaughterhouses, followed by a confirmatory test for positive samples.",PMC4365254,PMC4365254_1
"The sensitivities and specificities of the OIE-certified serological diagnostic kits are comparable to those of the ica, indicating its high precision and throughput.",PMC4365254,PMC4365254_2
"The study suggests that the assay developed here might assist governmental entities in the rapid diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels due to its high specificity compared to that of the UPRER real-time RT-PCR, and its high repeatability and reproducibility.",PMC4365254,PMC4365254_3
"The detection limit of the ica on the nucleocapsid protein was 1.5 ng/ml, which suggests that the assay might be applicable to the medical field for human samples or samples containing other MERS-CoV-related viruses due to its targeting of the conserved region of the virus.",PMC4365254,PMC4365254_4
