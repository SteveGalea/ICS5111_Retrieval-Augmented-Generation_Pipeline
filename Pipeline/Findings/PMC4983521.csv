"The formation of replication compartments (RCs) in viruses such as flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and picornaviruses is crucial for their replication. RCs are distinct membrane-bound structures that provide a suitable environment for viral replication by concentrating viral replication proteins, RNA, and nucleotides.",PMC4983521,PMC4983521_0
"The formation of RCs involves the manipulation of cellular membranes by viral and host cell factors. Viruses can either invaginate existing cellular membranes, such as in flaviviruses and coronaviruses, or generate double membrane vesicles (DMVs), such as in picornaviruses.",PMC4983521,PMC4983521_1
"The formation of flavivirus and coronavirus RCs involves the invagination of existing cellular membranes. This process is initiated by the formation of an intracellular membrane-bound structure called the membrane-associated replication complex (MARC). Viral proteins, such as the non-structural protein (NSP) 3 of hepatitis C virus (HCV), and host cell factors, such as reticulons, are involved in this process.",PMC4983521,PMC4983521_2
"The formation of picornavirus RCs involves the generation of DMVs. This process is initiated by the recruitment of cellular factors involved in de novo lipid synthesis, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN), to sites of viral replication. Viral proteins, such as the picornavirus 2A protein, also play a role in this process.",PMC4983521,PMC4983521_3
"The formation of RCs is crucial for the replication and infectivity of viruses. The manipulation of lipid synthesis is a general strategy for RC formation, with viral proteins and host cell factors involved in lipid metabolism, such as phospholipid kinases and lipid transfer proteins, playing a role in this process. The success of targeting proteins involved in RC formation as antiviral strategies in cell culture has been demonstrated, and further investigation is needed to determine whether this can be extended to patient therapeutic strategies.",PMC4983521,PMC4983521_4
