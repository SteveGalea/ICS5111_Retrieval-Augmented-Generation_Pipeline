"In the context of a travel group to Saudi Arabia, a common source of infection for both case 1 and 2 cannot be identified. However, exposure to camels and dairy products cannot be ruled out as a possible source of infection.",PMC4200475,PMC4200475_0
"In the context of hospital visits, infection of case 1 can be attributed to exposure during a visit to a hospital in Medina. However, infection of case 2 cannot be attributed to a specific hospital visit, as exposure to a common source of infection for both case 1 and 2 cannot be excluded.",PMC4200475,PMC4200475_1
"In the context of travel group, asymptomatic infection among the accompanying travellers cannot be excluded, although the number of travellers is too small to draw definite conclusions.",PMC4200475,PMC4200475_2
"In the context of epidemiological studies among a well-defined group of travellers, the exact source of infection remains difficult to identify, due to uncertainty in the source. However, the suggested role of underlying disease to develop mers-cov infection is in line with the age and comorbidity of the two Dutch cases and the absence of symptomatic mers-cov infection among the younger and healthier travellers.",PMC4200475,PMC4200475_3
"In the context of laboratory testing, ongoing serological analysis among parts of the viral genome collected from both patients and asymptomatic infection among the remaining travellers cannot be excluded, although the number of travellers is too small to draw definite conclusions.",PMC4200475,PMC4200475_4
