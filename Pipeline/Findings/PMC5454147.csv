"Camelids, such as dromedary camels and alpacas, are the main source of mers-cov transmission, with experimental evidence of susceptibility provided.",PMC5454147,PMC5454147_0
"Non-camelid domestic species, such as pigs and rabbits, are also susceptible to mers-cov infection, with lower viral titers detected in nasal swabs and tissue samples upon infection.",PMC5454147,PMC5454147_1
"Nhp species, such as rhesus macaques and common marmosets, develop clinical disease similar to humans and may also play a role in the transmission of the virus.",PMC5454147,PMC5454147_2
"The key role of domestic animals and wildlife in mers-cov transmission should be further elucidated, and countermeasures against deadly coronaviruses must be explored due to the risk of a global outbreak.",PMC5454147,PMC5454147_3
"Effective vaccine prototypes against mers-cov are already available, but vaccine licensing procedures should be facilitated to encourage their development and release into the market.",PMC5454147,PMC5454147_4
