"Pcv2 infection activates the cellular stress pathways involving jnk and p38 mapk, which are required for efficient pcv2 replication and apoptotic cell death.",PMC2687389,PMC2687389_0
"Inhibition of jnk or p38 mapk activation reduces pcv2 viral transcription, protein synthesis, and progeny production, indicating that these specific inhibitors have a preferential effect on pcv2 viral protein synthesis and/or RNA transcription.",PMC2687389,PMC2687389_1
Reduction of pcv2-induced apoptotic caspase activity is achieved by interference with the jnk and p38 mapk pathways.,PMC2687389,PMC2687389_2
"The study demonstrates that pcv2-induced activation of jnk and p38 is involved in the mechanism by which pcv2 triggers an apoptotic program in infected cells, potentially through stabilization and phosphorylation of p53.",PMC2687389,PMC2687389_3
The findings reported in the study contribute important information about the molecular mechanism of pcv2 pathogenesis.,PMC2687389,PMC2687389_4
