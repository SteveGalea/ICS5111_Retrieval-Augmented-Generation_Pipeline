Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and adult fish were used to study the role of the transcription factor zebrafish enhancer binding protein 2 (Zeb2) in regulating hematopoietic cell differentiation.,PMC5187668,PMC5187668_0
"In zebrafish embryos, Zeb2 is required for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and differentiation into myeloid cells. In adult fish, Zeb2 is required for the maintenance of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.",PMC5187668,PMC5187668_1
"Zeb2 is also involved in the regulation of T cell development, as Zeb2-deficient mice have reduced numbers of CD4 T cells in the thymus and peripheral blood.",PMC5187668,PMC5187668_2
"In vitro studies showed that Zeb2 is required for the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into myeloid cells, as Zeb2-deficient cells failed to differentiate into myeloid cells.",PMC5187668,PMC5187668_3
"Zeb2 was found to bind to a putative enhancer element in the promoter region of the myeloid cell-specific gene Cebpa, suggesting a direct role in regulating its expression.",PMC5187668,PMC5187668_4
"In zebrafish embryos, the overexpression of Zeb2 led to an increase in Cebpa expression and a shift towards myeloid differentiation, while the knockdown of Zeb2 resulted in a decrease in Cebpa expression and a shift towards lymphoid differentiation.",PMC5187668,PMC5187668_5
"In vitro studies also showed that Zeb2 interacts with the histone methyltransferase Mll, suggesting a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression during hematopoietic cell differentiation.",PMC5187668,PMC5187668_6
"In zebrafish embryos, the overexpression of Zeb2 in CD41-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells resulted in an increase in myeloid differentiation and the formation of larger myeloid cell clusters.",PMC5187668,PMC5187668_7
"In mice, the overexpression of Zeb2 in myeloid cells resulted in an increase in myeloid cell numbers in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.",PMC5187668,PMC5187668_8
"The study also identified a novel role for Zeb2 in T cell development, as Zeb2-deficient mice had",PMC5187668,PMC5187668_9
