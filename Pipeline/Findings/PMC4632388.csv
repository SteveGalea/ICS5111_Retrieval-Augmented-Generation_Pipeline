The study of viroporins in small DNA tumor viruses offers insights into their functions and potential targets for future antiviral therapies due to the low mutation rate of their genomes.,PMC4632388,PMC4632388_0
"Viroporins are multi-faceted viral proteins that play key roles in the life cycles of important human pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, and Ebola virus.",PMC4632388,PMC4632388_1
Deletion mutants in viroporins can provide insights into their functions and may help in the development of new anti-viral drugs due to the low mutation rate of dna virus genomes.,PMC4632388,PMC4632388_2
"Viroporins are involved in manipulating critical host functions, and their contribution towards the productive life cycle of these viruses and ultimately their pathogenesis is being studied.",PMC4632388,PMC4632388_3
"The identification of viroporin encoded targets as exemplified by the viroporins presents an attractive target for future antiviral therapies due to the need for new treatments in light of the large economic and health burden associated with virus infection, alongside the rapid increase in resistance to existing therapeutic regimes, if available.",PMC4632388,PMC4632388_4
