"The study found that in all four US states studied, the majority of rsv infections in children under the age of 5 are caused by contact with individuals over the age of 50. This highlights the importance of targeting vaccination efforts towards older individuals to prevent rsv transmission to younger, more vulnerable populations.",PMC5135296,PMC5135296_0
"The study also found that in the elderly population, rsv infection is more common in individuals who have experienced multiple rsv infections in the past, suggesting that these individuals may serve as a reservoir for rsv transmission.",PMC5135296,PMC5135296_1
"The study demonstrated that in all four US states studied, the majority of rsv infections in adults over the age of 50 occur in the winter season. This suggests that rsv seasonality may be driven by factors other than temperature, such as indoor crowding during the holiday season.",PMC5135296,PMC5135296_2
"The study found that in all four US states studied, children under the age of 5 who are infected with rsv miss an average of 2.3 days of daycare during the peak of viral load, indicating the importance of targeting vaccination efforts towards childcare facilities to prevent rsv transmission.",PMC5135296,PMC5135296_3
"The study also found that in all four US states studied, rsv infection in children under the age of 5 is more common in individuals who have already experienced multiple rsv infections in the past, suggesting that these individuals may serve as a reservoir for rsv transmission to younger, more vulnerable populations.",PMC5135296,PMC5135296_4
