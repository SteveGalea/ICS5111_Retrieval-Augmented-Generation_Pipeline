"The virus-cell attachment assay described in the protocol is sensitive and can reliably detect attachment over a large dynamic range, requiring as little as 20 pfu (moi of ~0.0004 in a 48-well plate) and can accurately measure productive binding events by standard infectious virus due to its extreme sensitivity.",PMC4828211,PMC4828211_0
"The qPCR-based method described in the protocol can be used over a large dynamic range of copy numbers (e.g., from 0.0004 to at least 40) due to its high sensitivity, significantly reducing the quantity of virus needed for the assay and limiting additional handling steps that may impact the quality of virions being used in the assay.",PMC4828211,PMC4828211_1
"The modified assay, which can measure additional stages of viral entry including viral particle endocytosis and the final step of virus fusion, can be performed by following the steps of the attachment protocol through step 2.5, which is attachment of particles to cells at 4Â°C, and then warming the cells to allow viral particles to be endocytosed or measuring genome uncoating following fusion of viral and endosomal membranes.",PMC4828211,PMC4828211_2
"The protocol described can be easily modified to study virus attachment, endocytosis, or fusion for other viruses provided the rt-PCR reagents are tailored to the new virus of interest, as demonstrated in previous studies.",PMC4828211,PMC4828211_3
