Replacement of cs1 and/or cs2 by the cs3 p4-lkgg-p1 amino acid sequence in the presence of active plp1 or inactive plp1 (p1ko) allows for the recovery of infectious virus.,PMC2903247,PMC2903247_0
"Processing of nsp2 and nsp3 occurs at the substituted cs2(3) site in the presence of inactive plp1 (p1ko), indicating that plp2 processes at this site.",PMC2903247,PMC2903247_1
"The cs1(3) virus demonstrates growth kinetics intermediate between those of the wt and δcs1 mutant viruses, suggesting that substitution of p4-lkgg-p1 compensates for loss of cleavage at cs1(3).",PMC2903247,PMC2903247_2
"The cs1/2(3) and cs1/2(3)+p1ko viruses exhibit identical levels of growth, indicating that plp1 is not important in the growth of these viruses and supporting the conclusion that plp2 is the active protease at the engineered cs2(3) site.",PMC2903247,PMC2903247_3
"The growth phenotypes of the cs1(3) and cs2(3) mutants were not predictable on the basis of the results seen with the δcs1 and δcs2 viruses, suggesting that the presence or loss of cleavage alone was not the sole determinant of protein or precursor functions.",PMC2903247,PMC2903247_4
