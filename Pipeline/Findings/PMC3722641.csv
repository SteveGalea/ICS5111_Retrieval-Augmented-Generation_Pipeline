"In Germany, hantavirus disease is associated with two viruses, puumala virus and dobrava-belgrade virus, with the former being the most commonly causing infection in humans.",PMC3722641,PMC3722641_0
"Hantavirus infections are transmitted to humans via virus-containing secretions of the rodent hosts, with horizontal transmission from person to person not observed in Europe.",PMC3722641,PMC3722641_1
"Hantavirus outbreaks in humans, with marked variations in annual case numbers, are believed to be associated with mass reproduction of the bank vole, which is favored by climatic factors and beech mast in the preceding year.",PMC3722641,PMC3722641_2
"Molecular epidemiological fine differentiation of puumala virus strains during outbreaks in Germany has revealed that viral strains from each outbreak area form their own sequence cluster, with nucleotide sequences from patients and local bank voles being closely related.",PMC3722641,PMC3722641_3
"Preventive measures, such as avoiding contact with voles and their secretions, keeping food safe, and regularly examining laboratory animals for persistent hantavirus infection, are crucial in reducing exposure of people living in endemic areas to the pathogen.",PMC3722641,PMC3722641_4
