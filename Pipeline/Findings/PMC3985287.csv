"The structural relationships between envelope proteins in different virus families, previously thought to have evolved from a common ancestor, instead suggest that they may have evolved independently from different host cell membrane fusion proteins.",PMC3985287,PMC3985287_0
"Viral fusion proteins with conserved class I and class III folds have been identified in viruses from unrelated families, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.",PMC3985287,PMC3985287_1
"Fusion proteins with conserved class II folds have been identified in viruses from otherwise unrelated families, suggesting that the class II fold is more prevalent and widely distributed across virus families than previously anticipated.",PMC3985287,PMC3985287_2
"The structural conservation of certain fusion proteins across virus families points to a new evolutionary paradigm for how these proteins evolved, where they may have been borrowed from different host cell fusion proteins during evolution.",PMC3985287,PMC3985287_3
The conservation of an Î±-helical coiled coil architecture in class I viral proteins and in the snare family of intracellular vesicle fusion proteins provides a possible precedent for the evolutionary transfer of a structural membrane fusion fold between host and virus during evolution.,PMC3985287,PMC3985287_4
