"Two amino acid substitutions, p305l and n345d, were identified in the capsid protein vp60 of rabbit hemorrhagic virus (rhdv) after serial passaging under immune pressure. These mutations, along with a silent substitution in the viral polymerase, are beneficial under antibody selection and rapidly became fixed in virus populations.",PMC5348035,PMC5348035_0
"Continued passaging did not produce a complete immune escape variant. This observation is consistent with the idea of ‘diminishing returns epistasis’, where the rate of fitness increase diminishes over time in the shape of a logarithmic function.",PMC5348035,PMC5348035_1
"The average number of polymorphisms that appeared per passage was comparable between selected and control groups. However, the number of polymorphisms clearly increased in later passages compared with earlier passages in both selected and control rabbits.",PMC5348035,PMC5348035_2
"The g27s mutation (nucleotide position 517) within the p23/26 coding region was consistently present at a relatively low frequency in animals with and without antibody treatment, in all except two passages.",PMC5348035,PMC5348035_3
"Overall, the passage 10 virus was highly virulent during passaging experiments, causing clinical rhd within 48 hours post-infection and the onset of terminal signs by 4 days post-infection.",PMC5348035,PMC5348035_4
