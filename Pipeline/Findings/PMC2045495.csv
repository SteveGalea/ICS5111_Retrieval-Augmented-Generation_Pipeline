"The study identifies a new family of deubiquitinating enzymes, termed herpesvirus tegument usps (htusps), which are conserved in all herpesvirus subfamilies.",PMC2045495,PMC2045495_0
"The htusp domain is located at the N-terminal end of large tegument proteins, and its conservation suggests an important function for this activity.",PMC2045495,PMC2045495_1
"The study reveals that the herpesvirus-encoded htusp is necessary and sufficient to confer activity and specificity toward ub-based substrates, while the carboxy-terminal sequence of vp1/2 tegument protein, which is essential in pseudorabies virus, is dispensable.",PMC2045495,PMC2045495_2
"The study shows that orf64usp, the mhv-68-encoded htusp, covalently binds ubvme and less efficiently binds nedd8-vme, but it hydrolyzes ub-amc, but not nedd8-amc, and the accumulation of the covalent adducts of orf64usp with nedd8-vme is irreversible.",PMC2045495,PMC2045495_3
"The study suggests that the biological role of the herpesvirus usps will require the identification of their natural substrates, and the ability to generate mutants of herpesviruses that lack this activity may help attain this goal.",PMC2045495,PMC2045495_4
