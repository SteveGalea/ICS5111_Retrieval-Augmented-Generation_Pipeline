"Ldv infection causes widespread and rapid activation of both B cells and T cells in lymphoid tissues and the blood, with ifnα being a known inducer of early lymphocyte activation.",PMC2699471,PMC2699471_0
"Neutralization of ifnα in the plasma from infected mice ablated its ability to activate lymphocytes in vitro, indicating that ifnα is responsible for lymphocyte activation during ldv infection.",PMC2699471,PMC2699471_1
"Depletion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC's) prior to ldv infection and testing for lymphocyte activation revealed that pDC's respond with a lymphocyte-inducing ifnα response, and that depletion of pDC's in vivo eradicated both the ifnα response and lymphocyte activation.",PMC2699471,PMC2699471_2
"Virus levels in both tlr7 knockout mice and pDC-depleted mice were indistinguishable from controls, indicating that ldv is largely resistant to the antiviral effects of ifnα, even when present at very high systemic levels.",PMC2699471,PMC2699471_3
Results indicate that ldv-induced activation of lymphocytes is due to recognition of ldv nucleic acid by toll-like receptor 7 (tlr7) pattern recognition receptors in pDC's that respond with a lymphocyte-inducing ifnα response.,PMC2699471,PMC2699471_4
