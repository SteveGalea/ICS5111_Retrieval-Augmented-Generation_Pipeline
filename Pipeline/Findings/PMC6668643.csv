The case presents a patient with predominantly articular systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) manifestations who develops pleuropericarditis that remains refractory to treatment with immunosuppressants and corticosteroids.,PMC6668643,PMC6668643_0
"Belimumab, a monoclonal antibody against B lymphocyte stimulator, is introduced as a first biological treatment option for SLE with pleuropericarditis, resulting in the resolution of serositis and improvement of SLE markers.",PMC6668643,PMC6668643_1
"The patient's SLE disease activity index score decreases, and corticosteroid intake is reduced, suggesting that belimumab acts as a corticosteroid-sparing agent.",PMC6668643,PMC6668643_2
The case highlights the need for further studies to confirm the effectiveness of belimumab in controlling SLE activity and reducing corticosteroid intake.,PMC6668643,PMC6668643_3
"The case presents predictors of response to belimumab, including active SLE disease, musculoskeletal and/or mucocutaneous manifestations, active serology, disproportionate corticosteroid intake, and a relapsingâ€“remitting course.",PMC6668643,PMC6668643_4
