"The study identifies a previously unknown function of uvrag in regulating virus entry through multiple interactions with the membrane fusion machinery of cells, independent of ifn and autophagy activation.",PMC3932887,PMC3932887_0
"The study defines snares required for endocytic transport and fusion of the virus, including iav ha proteins, a/pr/8/34, a/udorn/72, and a/thailand/2(sp-33)/2004, as well as glycoproteins from vsv, lasv, and lcmv.",PMC3932887,PMC3932887_1
"The study shows that a specific complex assembly consisting of the q-snares stx7, vti1b, and stx8 and the r-snare vamp8 is critical for virus entry, while the q-snare pairing with vamp7 is drastically reduced.",PMC3932887,PMC3932887_2
"The study demonstrates that the viral-resistant phenotype in uvrag-deficient cells correlates with the impaired entry processes of vsv and iav, both of which require acidic compartments to trigger their entry.",PMC3932887,PMC3932887_3
The study suggests that discrepant binding and snare assembly induced by viral infection could potentially reflect a strategy of the virus to evade lysosome degradation and immune recognition.,PMC3932887,PMC3932887_4
