"A new strain of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is spreading rapidly, particularly in China where it originated.",PMC7067954,PMC7067954_0
"This virus causes COVID-19, and has been reported in several Asian and non-Asian countries due to imported cases.",PMC7067954,PMC7067954_1
"In this study, the complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from a Nepalese patient was reported, confirming it was acquired in Wuhan, China and imported to Nepal.",PMC7067954,PMC7067954_2
"Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this new strain has >99.99% identity with previously sequenced genomes from Wuhan, China, and >99.9% identity with seven additional sequences.",PMC7067954,PMC7067954_3
"Five mutations were identified in the new strain, including a silent mutation at the spike gene and nonsilent mutations in ORF1a and ORF8b. These findings contribute to our understanding of the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2.",PMC7067954,PMC7067954_4
