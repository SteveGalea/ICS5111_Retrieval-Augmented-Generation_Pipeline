"Homology modeling reveals that the structure of alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit (chrna7) is conserved and composed of extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains. Binding site prediction identifies five potential ligand-binding sites.",PMC5566677,PMC5566677_0
"Chrna7 interacts with a range of proteins involved in neurological diseases, including those associated with Alzheimer's, neuroblastoma, and schizophrenia. This suggests that chrna7 is a key regulator of neuronal development and differentiation.",PMC5566677,PMC5566677_1
"Ramachandran plot analysis confirms that the majority (80%) of residues in the modeled structure of chrna7 lie in a favorable region, indicating high structural accuracy.",PMC5566677,PMC5566677_2
"Binding site prediction identifies a binding site with a high score (1.228) and volume (985.0), suggesting its importance for ligand binding and potential therapeutic targeting.",PMC5566677,PMC5566677_3
"Protein interaction analysis reveals that chrna7 interacts with proteins involved in various neurological processes such as cell growth, development, differentiation, and histone modifications, further highlighting its significance in neuronal development and differentiation, and as a potential cumulative target for neurological disorders.",PMC5566677,PMC5566677_4
