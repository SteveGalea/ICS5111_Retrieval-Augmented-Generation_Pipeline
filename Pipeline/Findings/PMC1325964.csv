The study quantifies the impact of observed heterogeneities in bacterial carriage on the transmission dynamics of E. Coli O157 and demonstrates that a robust pattern emerges in which approximately 20% of infections are responsible for 80% of the transmission.,PMC1325964,PMC1325964_0
The study finds that significant reductions in the basic reproduction ratio (r0) can be achieved by targeting control measures at a small proportion of the population.,PMC1325964,PMC1325964_1
The study suggests that a limited sensitivity of the immunomagnetic separation test used to detect E. Coli O157 does not significantly affect the results.,PMC1325964,PMC1325964_2
The study identifies a pattern of heterogeneity in between- and within-host infectiousness that is common to a variety of disease systems.,PMC1325964,PMC1325964_3
The study highlights the importance of future studies aimed at determining the causes of high-level shedding of E. Coli O157.,PMC1325964,PMC1325964_4
