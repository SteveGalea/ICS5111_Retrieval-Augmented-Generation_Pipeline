Contact networks and epidemic behavior are linked to individual contact patterns.,PMC4647802,PMC4647802_0
"Limited empirical data on contact networks is available, but online respondent-driven detection can provide relevant epidemiological data.",PMC4647802,PMC4647802_1
"Participants tended to recruit contact persons similar to themselves based on age, education, household size, vaccine-induced immunity, and sentiments, indicating assortative mixing patterns.",PMC4647802,PMC4647802_2
"Participants' recruitment was random by sex and numbers of contact persons, but relationships between pairs were influenced by spatial distribution.",PMC4647802,PMC4647802_3
"The observed statistical relationships reflected the observed contact network patterns in the general population relevant for respiratory pathogen transmission, providing useful input for predictive epidemic models.",PMC4647802,PMC4647802_4
