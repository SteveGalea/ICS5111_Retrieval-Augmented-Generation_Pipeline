"The study reports the high-resolution structures of two crystal forms of the n-terminal RNA-binding domain of SARS-CoV n protein, which suggests similarities and differences in ribonucleocapsid assembly among SARS-CoV, IBV, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.",PMC1866093,PMC1866093_0
"The study reveals that the RNA-binding domain of SARS-CoV n protein is disordered in both crystal forms, but in the monoclinic crystal form, the RNA-binding domain is ordered in a similar conformation as seen in IBV n protein.",PMC1866093,PMC1866093_1
"The study suggests that the RNA-binding domain of SARS-CoV n protein interacts with RNA through short sequences of locally conserved sequences, but the surface charge distribution patterns of the models are different despite having similar overall organizations.",PMC1866093,PMC1866093_2
"The study highlights that the RNA-binding domain of SARS-CoV n protein is oriented in a similar conformation as seen in IBV n protein, and if indeed the trimeric helical arrangement of n-ntd seen in the cubic form is one possibly physiologically relevant form of RNA, it is likely to face the other face of the quasilattice.",PMC1866093,PMC1866093_3
"The study suggests that viral closure or the pinching-off event is an even less-understood process in the immediate vicinity of the luminal face of virion envelope, and further studies on the full-length n protein and complementation studies between the n-tds and c-tds of n protein are needed to understand the interplay between these two domains within the n-m layer of coronaviruses.",PMC1866093,PMC1866093_4
