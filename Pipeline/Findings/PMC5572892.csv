"In a study analyzing the feces of laboratory ferrets, a previously unknown coronavirus, ferret coronavirus (frcov), was detected. Frcov particles were found in 34.9% of the ferrets, and the complete genome sequence of frcov4370 was analyzed, revealing similarities to other ferret and mink coronaviruses but lower similarities to other known coronaviruses.",PMC5572892,PMC5572892_0
"The frcov genome contains 9 proteins, including structural proteins such as the large spike protein (s), which shares 92.5% amino acid identity with another frcov strain and has low similarity to other known coronaviruses.",PMC5572892,PMC5572892_1
"The frcov genome also contains nonstructural proteins, such as orf3c, an accessory triple-spanning membrane protein, and orf3x and orf7b, with 74 and 204 amino acids, respectively.",PMC5572892,PMC5572892_2
"The study identified 2 strains of frcov, frcov4370 and frcov063, with similar structures and 94% nucleotide identity with each other but lower similarities to other known coronaviruses, suggesting that ferret coronaviruses may be classified as a new species in the genus Alphacoronavirus.",PMC5572892,PMC5572892_3
The complete genome sequence of frcov will contribute to understanding the diversity of animal coronaviruses and the establishment of new taxonomic units.,PMC5572892,PMC5572892_4
