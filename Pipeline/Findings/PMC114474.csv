"The study revealed that the packaging signal determines the selectivity and efficiency of incorporation of specific rna species into the mhv virus particle, as m protein selectively interacts with rna containing the packaging signal, complexed with n protein, in the presence of the packaging signal.",PMC114474,PMC114474_0
"The study demonstrated that binding of m protein to the packaging signal, but not to the 69-nt packaging signal, conferred a relatively higher packaging efficiency than did the 69-nt packaging signal.",PMC114474,PMC114474_1
"The study showed that n protein binding to the packaging signal, but not to the 69-nt packaging signal, induced a specific conformational change in n protein that could serve as a nucleation event for the cooperative binding of n protein to the rest of the rna, thereby generating the helical nucleocapsid structure.",PMC114474,PMC114474_2
"The study suggested that m protein may efficiently interact only with one specific helical nucleocapsid structure that is ordained by the packaging signal, in the presence of the packaging signal, among a pool of intracellular viral rnp complexes, and that m protein may specifically bind the packaging signal directly.",PMC114474,PMC114474_3
"The study implied that the expressed ps5b190 transcripts that were not associated with n protein probably bound to m protein in mhv-infected cells, and that the expressed m protein bound to the expressed ps5b190 transcripts, but not ps5a transcripts, in the absence of n protein.",PMC114474,PMC114474_4
