"The nonstructural protein orf6-ha, encoded by the open reading frame 6 in the sars-cov genome, is essential for the pathogenesis of infection with this virus.",PMC1193615,PMC1193615_0
"Orf6-ha enhances virus growth and spread in tissue culture cells and in mice, without affecting the innate or adaptive cellular immune response or virus susceptibility to interferon-Î² treatment.",PMC1193615,PMC1193615_1
"Orf6-ha is distributed throughout the cell and is membrane associated, with the highest concentration in the perinuclear area, where the n and m proteins are also localized.",PMC1193615,PMC1193615_2
"Orf6-ha directly increases the efficiency of virus replication, assembly, or spread, as both viral RNA and protein levels are increased in sars-cov-infected cells compared to those infected with a virus lacking orf6-ha.",PMC1193615,PMC1193615_3
"Orf6-ha may preferentially affect growth in macrophages and dendritic cells, with consequent immune dysregulation, as these cell types are infected by both sars-cov and another coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, in cats carrying this virus, and are associated with immunosuppression, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and significant morbidity and mortality.",PMC1193615,PMC1193615_4
