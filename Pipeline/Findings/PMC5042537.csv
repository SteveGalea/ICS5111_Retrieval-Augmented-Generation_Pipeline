"The study developed a rapid detection assay, called reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-rpa), for the rapid detection of chikungunya virus (chikv) in clinical samples.",PMC5042537,PMC5042537_0
"The rt-rpa assay was designed to detect chikv down to 80 genome copies per reaction, which is slightly higher than the 10 genome copies per microliter detected by reference real-time rt-pcr methods.",PMC5042537,PMC5042537_1
"The rt-rpa assay was tested on 58 suspect chikv-infected cases, as well as 20 acute samples from France, and showed an overall sensitivity and specificity of 100% in comparison to real-time rt-pcr.",PMC5042537,PMC5042537_2
"The study showed that the rt-rpa assay did not cross-react with other common alpha- and arboviruses, except for onnv, which could be due to the four or seven mismatches in the primers and probe sequences, respectively.",PMC5042537,PMC5042537_3
"The study suggested that the rt-rpa assay could be used as a promising tool for chikv diagnostics at the point of need, and its integration into a multiplex assay for simultaneous and differential detection of chikv, dengue virus, and Zika virus, as well as an internal positive control, could improve outbreak investigations, since the three viruses induce the same clinical picture upon infection and increasingly co-circulate in many parts of the world.",PMC5042537,PMC5042537_4
