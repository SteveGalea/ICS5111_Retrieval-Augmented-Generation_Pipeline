"This study analyzed the s gene of 55 Chinese field strains isolated from South China during 2011-2015, revealing a high sequence similarity with previously identified Guangdong strains. The results suggest the homogeneity in the s genes of pedv field strains prevalent in South China.",PMC5489471,PMC5489471_0
"The s genes of the 55 field strains in this study exhibited length diversity, with the exception of two strains. One field strain had a shorter s gene due to nucleotide deletions, while the s genes of 45 field strains were longer due to nucleotide insertions.",PMC5489471,PMC5489471_1
"The s genes of the 53 South China strains, except for two strains, contained several amino acid substitutions compared to vaccine strains, resulting in changes in the ss6, 2C10, and COE neutralizing epitopes. These findings indicate that the three substitutions represent a marker of increased pedv viability.",PMC5489471,PMC5489471_2
"The study found that, with the exception of two strains, the remaining 53 South China strains shared similar molecular characteristics, including the presence of three amino acid substitutions, which represent a marker of increased pedv viability and have been observed in European strains and Asian strains, including those isolated in China, Korea, and Japan after 2010.",PMC5489471,PMC5489471_3
"The study's analysis of the s genes and molecular epidemiology of 55 field strains from South China indicates that pedvs circulating between 2011 and 2015 in this region have evolved from historic strains within the local region, providing useful findings for improving pedv control strategies in this region. Additionally, the study's results could be informative for monitoring and predicting the potential emergence of a recombinant CoV from animals, given the high frequency of recombination events in CoVs and the potential for unpredictable changes in virulence during human infections.",PMC5489471,PMC5489471_4
