"The study found that both bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRSV) infections are highly prevalent in Swedish beef cattle, with overall seroprevalences of 43.1% and 39.2%, respectively. 2. The study identified two areas with particularly high prevalences for both BCV and BRSV, located in the central-western and southern parts of Sweden. 3. The study found a strong relationship at animal level between BCV and BRSV infections, as animals testing positive to BCV were more likely to also test positive to BRSV, and vice versa. 4. The study found that areas with a high density of beef herds (>10 herds/100 km²) had a significantly higher risk of being part of high-prevalence clusters for both BCV and BRSV infections. 5. The study identified a low-prevalence area for BRSV infections that also had a high density of beef herds (2 herds/100 km²), suggesting that there are other factors with an uneven geographic distribution that have an impact on BCV and BRSV prevalences.",PMC2898781,PMC2898781_0
