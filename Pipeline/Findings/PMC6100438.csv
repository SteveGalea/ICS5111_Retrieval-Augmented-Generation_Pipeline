The presented method of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array and circular dichroism (HPLC-DAD-CD) allowed for simultaneous separation and quantification of the main chiral glucosinolates in Radix Isatidis (R. Isatidis) with high efficiency and accuracy.,PMC6100438,PMC6100438_0
"This method enables the separation and quantification of progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin by UV detection, while R-goitrin and S-goitrin are separated by coupling with CD detection.",PMC6100438,PMC6100438_1
"Through the linear relations between the anisotropy factor (g) and the percent optical purities of R-goitrin, the contents of R-goitrin and S-goitrin can be successfully calculated.",PMC6100438,PMC6100438_2
"The study found that the variance character of each of the glucosinolate contents was different in crude drugs, decotion pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis, indicating the need for better control of the internal quality of these products.",PMC6100438,PMC6100438_3
