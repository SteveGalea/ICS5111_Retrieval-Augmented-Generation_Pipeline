"Stress granules (SGs) are formed in response to cellular stress and serve as signaling platforms to regulate cell metabolism, survival, and innate immune responses.",PMC4848588,PMC4848588_0
"Enteroviruses, including poliovirus (PV) and coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3), disperse SGs in cells infected with these viruses, and the mechanisms of SG assembly are unknown.",PMC4848588,PMC4848588_1
Enterovirus infection inhibits SG assembly through an unknown mechanism(s).,PMC4848588,PMC4848588_2
"G3BP1, a critical factor in SG assembly, is antiviral as SGs formed in response to G3BP1 overexpression are antiviral against multiple enteroviruses, including PV and CVB3.",PMC4848588,PMC4848588_3
"Enteroviruses utilize several pathways simultaneously to disperse SGs in cells, including the two viral proteinases, 2Apro and 3Cpro, which block different pathways that promote SG assembly.",PMC4848588,PMC4848588_4
"The emerging crosstalk between stress, innate immunity, and inflammation suggests future novel strategies to control stress-triggers of autoimmune disease and other non-viral diseases may be possible.",PMC4848588,PMC4848588_5
Future work with enteroviruses should address remaining questions and vigorously pursue unknown viral protease targets.,PMC4848588,PMC4848588_6
"How exactly does G3BP1 scission destroy SG assembly, and what are the cofactors?",PMC4848588,PMC4848588_7
"What is the mechanism of dcp1a activation of pkr, and how else may the RNA decay pathway be linked to innate immune signaling?",PMC4848588,PMC4848588_8
"How are P-bodies dispersed, and what is the mechanistic role of 2Apro in this?",PMC4848588,PMC4848588_9
Future studies with enteroviruses should address these areas and produce novel antiviral therapeutic agents.,PMC4848588,PMC4848588_10
