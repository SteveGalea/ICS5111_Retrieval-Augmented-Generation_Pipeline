"In the context of a review on the effectiveness of community quarantine measures in controlling the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections, a study by Ferguson et al (2004) reported a significant association between the number of close contacts and the number of secondary cases, indicating that reduction in the number of close contacts may contribute to a decrease in transmission (Ferguson et al, 2004).",PMC2808319,PMC2808319_0
"In the context of a discussion on the challenges of random assignment of individuals to quarantine in the management of outbreaks, a paper by Ferguson et al (2004) highlighted the importance of data management resources and the need to understand the costs and benefits of enacting quarantine, and this includes a discussion of how quantitative benefit should be communicated to decision-makers and the public, and how to evaluate the impact of such measures (Ferguson et al, 2004).",PMC2808319,PMC2808319_1
"In the context of a review of the impact of quarantine on the spread of influenza virus infections, a study by Ferguson et al (2004) reported simulation data suggesting that community quarantine and isolation may play a role in influenza control, but with a caveat that further research is needed to understand the costs and benefits of such measures (Ferguson et al, 2004).",PMC2808319,PMC2808319_2
"In the context of a discussion on the challenges of interpretation and communication of health policy areas, a paper by Ferguson et al (2004) highlighted the need for further research and discussion to understand the costs and benefits of enacting quarantine, and this includes a discussion of how to communicate quantitative benefit to decision-makers and the public, and how to evaluate the impact of such measures (Ferguson et al, 2004).",PMC2808319,PMC2808319_3
"In the context of a review of the impact of quarantine on the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections, a study by Ferguson et al (2004) reported that the rate of false positive cases (resulting in no transmission) may have a large influence on the apparent benefit, and this finding is relevant to the current experience with pandemic influenza (Ferguson et al, 2004).",PMC2808319,PMC2808319_4
