"Both nebulized salbutamol and symbicort® (at a strength of 160/4.5 mcg per inhalation) demonstrated significant improvements in oxygen saturation (sao2), peak expiratory flow rate (pefr), and reduction in respiratory rate in patients with mild to moderate asthmatic attacks in the first 15 minutes post-intervention.",PMC3352303,PMC3352303_0
"Both treatments resulted in statistically significant improvements in lung function as measured by pefr, with patients in the symbicort® arm showing a mean improvement of 78.67 l/min, and those in the nebulized salbutamol arm showing a mean improvement of 89.41 l/min.",PMC3352303,PMC3352303_1
"In terms of subjective assessment, regardless of the type of intervention, the majority (56%) of patients reported feeling either ""a little better"" or ""much better"" in relation to symptom relief.",PMC3352303,PMC3352303_2
"The mean visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for patients in the symbicort® and nebulized salbutamol arms were 2.45 cm and 2.20 cm, respectively, indicating that patients in both arms reported similar improvements in symptom relief.",PMC3352303,PMC3352303_3
"Both treatments were well-tolerated, with none of the patients requiring admission, and none reported feeling ""no change,"" ""a little worse,"" or ""much worse"" after interventions.",PMC3352303,PMC3352303_4
