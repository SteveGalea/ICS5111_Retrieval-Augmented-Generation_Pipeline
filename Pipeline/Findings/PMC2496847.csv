"The newly described hla-b*1501-vqqessfvm complex shares structural similarities with other MHC-I molecules, particularly in the peptide-binding groove. This groove is lined with hydrophobic residues, which enables the binding of large aromatic residues such as tyrosine and phenylalanine.",PMC2496847,PMC2496847_0
"The electron density of the pval1 side chain in the a pocket of the peptide-binding groove is observed, indicating a hydrophobic interaction with aromatic ring systems of other residues, including tyrosine and phenylalanine.",PMC2496847,PMC2496847_1
"The conformation of pSer5 in the peptide-binding groove allows for hydrogen bonding with other residues, including n-terminal residues, which is unusual as water-mediated hydrogen bonds are typically observed in this region.",PMC2496847,PMC2496847_2
"The pGlu2 residue in the b pocket is found in a similar orientation to the previously described hla-b*1501-lekargsty structure, and is completely shielded from the surroundings by arginine 62, prohibiting any interaction with a potential t-cell receptor.",PMC2496847,PMC2496847_3
"The peptide c-terminal o atoms make a hydrogen bond with the nδ2 atom of asparagine 80 and the nζ atom of alanine 146, stabilizing peptide binding and shielding the peptide c-terminus from interactions with a t-cell receptor.",PMC2496847,PMC2496847_4
