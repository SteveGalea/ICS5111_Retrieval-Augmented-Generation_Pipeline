"A plant-made vaccine for the Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, which is transmitted by ticks and causes severe disease in humans and animals, has been developed and tested in mice. The vaccine, which consists of a domain of the envelope glycoprotein, is safe and effective, and could potentially replace the current live vaccine, which is not licensed for human use due to concerns over its safety.",PMC5718809,PMC5718809_0
"A plant-made vaccine for the West Nile fever (WNF) virus, which is also transmitted by ticks and causes severe disease in humans and animals, has been developed and tested in mice. The vaccine, which consists of a domain of the envelope glycoprotein, is safe and effective, and could potentially replace the current live vaccine, which is not licensed for human use due to concerns over its safety.",PMC5718809,PMC5718809_1
"A plant-made vaccine for the dengue virus, which causes severe disease in humans, has been developed and tested in mice. The vaccine, which consists of a domain of the envelope glycoprotein, is serotype-specific and elicits neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of the virus.",PMC5718809,PMC5718809_2
A plant-made enzyme replacement therapy for the glucocerebrosidase deficit that causes Gaucher's disease in humans has been developed and licensed for human use.,PMC5718809,PMC5718809_3
"Plant-made reagents, such as proteins and antibodies, have been developed and tested for use in point-of-care diagnostics, with the potential to make universal vaccination of livestock against certain diseases a reality. Plant-made influenza virus A vaccines, whether type-specific or universal, could also soon be a reality, with the potential for oral dosing.",PMC5718809,PMC5718809_4
