"The initiation factor eif2α is phosphorylated during rotavirus infection, but unlike in other viruses, such as reovirus, this phosphorylation does not result in the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis.",PMC2224440,PMC2224440_0
"Rotavirus infection prevents the formation of stress granules (SGs), which are induced by cellular stress, despite the fact that eif2α is phosphorylated.",PMC2224440,PMC2224440_1
"The viral protein nsp3 prevents the efficient translation of poly(A)-containing mRNAs, which results in a partial inhibition of cellular protein synthesis.",PMC2224440,PMC2224440_2
The relocalization of the cellular protein pabp from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in rotavirus-infected cells is dependent on the presence of nsp3.,PMC2224440,PMC2224440_3
"The viral protein vp2 is not required for the phosphorylation of eif2α during rotavirus infection, and the synthesis of viral proteins and yield of viral progeny are not affected by its absence.",PMC2224440,PMC2224440_4
