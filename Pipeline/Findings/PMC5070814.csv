"This study identified a large number of ae. aegypti small non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) through the de novo assembly of small RNA sequencing reads. The authors found that lncRNAs in A. aegypti are highly conserved across different populations and strains, suggesting their potential roles in host-pathogen interactions.",PMC5070814,PMC5070814_0
"The authors discovered that lncRNA_1317, which is upregulated in response to denv-2 infection, is not located in any of the known pirna clusters, but it has a large impact on lncRNA transcriptome through cross-regulation with microRNAs (miRNAs).",PMC5070814,PMC5070814_1
"The authors identified multiple hot spots for miRNA recognition sites on lncRNA_1317, which may allow multiple miRNAs to bind to the same regions. This finding suggests that lncRNAs with multiple recognition sites may actually be competitive inhibitors of miRNA function by sequestering them and stopping them from binding to their genuine targets.",PMC5070814,PMC5070814_2
The authors identified 114 differentially expressed lncRNAs in response to denv-2 infection in midgut and carcass. This finding suggests that lncRNAs may be involved in host-pathogen interactions and could potentially be targeted to inhibit virus replication or control vector populations.,PMC5070814,PMC5070814_3
"The authors discovered that lncRNA_1317 response to microbial challenge could be due to cross-regulation between miRNAs and the lncRNA. This finding suggests that lncRNAs may be involved in antiviral responses by controlling the expression of immune-related genes, similar to the role of miRNAs in mammalian systems.",PMC5070814,PMC5070814_4
