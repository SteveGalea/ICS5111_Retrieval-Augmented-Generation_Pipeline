"Trim21, a receptor for antibodies, is activated during viral infection and has two functions: eliminating viruses through an antibody-dependent mechanism called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and activating pro-inflammatory signaling.",PMC4670481,PMC4670481_0
"Trim21 is effective against non-enveloped viruses, such as adenovirus, and can provide systemic protection against viral infection.",PMC4670481,PMC4670481_1
"Trim21 synergistically interacts with three classes of antibodies, IgG, IgM, and IgA, and its biology is promiscuous in its antibody binding.",PMC4670481,PMC4670481_2
"Trim21 is important for preventing excessive inflammation during viral infection, and its activation thresholds for downstream ubiquitin-dependent processes are regulated.",PMC4670481,PMC4670481_3
"Trim21 may contribute to cross-presentation of viral peptides on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, resulting in the recruitment of cytotoxic lymphocytes to the infected cell, and it may intersect with other intracellular receptors specific for other immune serum proteins with antiviral functions.",PMC4670481,PMC4670481_4
