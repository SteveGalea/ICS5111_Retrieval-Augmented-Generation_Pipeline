"Forty-six contigs from bat guano samples showed similarity to alphacoronaviruses, including genes for spike protein, matrix, nucleocapsid, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP).",PMC3966383,PMC3966383_0
"The virus sequence from bat guano samples was confirmed in all four original samples using specific reverse transcription PCR for the RdRP gene, with 100% identity to Bat coronavirus HKU8.",PMC3966383,PMC3966383_1
"Phylogenetic analysis based on RdRP and spike protein genes placed the new alphacoronavirus in a clade with other alphacoronaviruses, indicating a relatively recent divergence.",PMC3966383,PMC3966383_2
"The discovery of the new alphacoronavirus in bat guano samples suggests a potential ancient origin for all coronaviruses, as the virus diverged relatively little from other extant alphacoronaviruses despite being isolated from other mammalian species for an estimated 800 years.",PMC3966383,PMC3966383_3
The study highlights the need for expanded surveys for the new alphacoronavirus in mammals in New Zealand and further characterization of viral genomes to better understand the origin of coronaviruses and the risk of cross-species transmission.,PMC3966383,PMC3966383_4
