"The study reports the isolation, expression, production, and purification of nucleocapsid protein from sars-cov using phage antibodies selection and carried out immunoassay and biochemical characterization of scfvs against n protein and its polypeptide fragments.",PMC1261265,PMC1261265_2
"The study identifies specific human mabs for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies against viral pathogens, including sars-cov, using a synthetic scfv antibody phage library to select specific scfv human antibodies against n protein.",PMC1261265,PMC1261265_3
"The study reports the use of intracellular expression as a novel strategy of gene therapy aimed at knockout the replicative cycle of sars-cov in infected cells, using immune library and synthetic peptides mimicking immunodominant epitopes in s or m sars-cov proteins as a substrate antigens for the identification of specific scfvs from a synthetic human phage antibody library.",PMC1261265,PMC1261265_4
