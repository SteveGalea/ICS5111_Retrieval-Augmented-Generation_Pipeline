The study found that the newly created large and small influenza-like illness (ili) groups based on correlation with positive respiratory pathogen specimens and signal-to-noise ratio had very similar temporal trends during each of the previous three seasons when compared to nationwide Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sentinel providers surveillance network data.,PMC2725845,PMC2725845_0
"The study identified that approximately half of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes within the ili syndrome group were associated with specimens positive for respiratory pathogens, including influenza, and that most codes followed the same temporal trends over time as positive specimens.",PMC2725845,PMC2725845_1
"The study recommended that health agencies use the ili-large and ili-small groups as a model for developing similar systems, but emphasized that developers perform critical analysis of the individual codes collected in their data and carefully consider which diagnoses are more likely to cause background ""noise"" rather than contribute to the signal.",PMC2725845,PMC2725845_2
"The study found that the less-specific ili-large group may be more useful for the initial detection of influenza season and for detecting other respiratory illnesses that initially cause similar symptoms, whereas the ili-small group is more specific but also more likely to signal slightly later than the large group because providers should use these codes cautiously until influenza cases have been confirmed.",PMC2725845,PMC2725845_3
"The study supported evidence that using nontraditional electronic data for syndromic surveillance may enable health providers to recognize and detect the influenza season faster than with traditional means. The study also emphasized the importance of critical review in defining and assessing syndrome groupings for ICD-9-based surveillance, as developers parse, analyze, and interpret their own data.",PMC2725845,PMC2725845_4
