A study tested 6 non-fda cleared niosh-approved n95 filtering facepiece respirators (n95 ffrs) for synthetic blood penetration using the Astm F1862 standard test method.,PMC4658509,PMC4658509_0
Four out of 6 niosh-approved n95 ffr models that were not cleared by the FDA passed the synthetic blood penetration criterion at 450 and 635 cm/sec velocities.,PMC4658509,PMC4658509_1
The synthetic blood penetration test results suggest the need for the development of a more accurate test method that can identify blood penetration on the inner side of masks with either a hydrophilic or hydrophobic layer.,PMC4658509,PMC4658509_2
The study indicates the need for the development of infection control policies and respirator shortages due to the shortage of FDA-cleared surgical n95 respirators during emergencies and pandemic events involving respiratory pathogens.,PMC4658509,PMC4658509_3
The ability of all of the n95 ffrs tested to pass 80% or greater at the lowest velocity also presents an opportunity to scrutinize the need for this specific test in determining suitability of respirators for use in medical environments.,PMC4658509,PMC4658509_4
