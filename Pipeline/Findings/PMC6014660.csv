"A randomized controlled trial involving 1,544 participants found that both mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and exercise training significantly reduced the incidence, duration, and overall severity of acute respiratory infection (ARI) illness, with effects comparable to those of influenza vaccination.",PMC6014660,PMC6014660_0
"The trial also found that MBSR and exercise training reduced absenteeism due to ARI illness and improved mental health, mindful attention, and self-efficacy, with potential benefits beyond ARI illness.",PMC6014660,PMC6014660_1
"The study highlights the need for further research into the benefits of exercise and meditation, particularly in higher risk or sicker populations, as both interventions appear likely to have pleiotropic effects, with reasonably strong data supporting their capacity to alleviate stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, and some preliminary evidence for cardiovascular and metabolic conditions.",PMC6014660,PMC6014660_2
"The study also suggests that year-to-year variability and other factors, such as etiological agents circulating, should be considered when assessing ARI prevention, as while upwards of 50% of people may experience an ARI illness in a given year, the risk of influenza-specific illness is generally less than 10%.",PMC6014660,PMC6014660_3
"The study underscores the importance of considering health impacts beyond ARI illness, as exercise is known to benefit people with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, may protect against cancer, and appears to confer psychological benefit, while mindfulness training likewise appears to have pleiotropic effects, with potentially significant benefits for multi-morbidity populations.",PMC6014660,PMC6014660_4
