"The study identifies sulphation of d-glucuronic acid and l-iduronic acid structures as a promising strategy for the development of rage targeting molecules. This is supported by the findings that heparin, sulphated k5 polysaccharides, and glycyrrhizin can inhibit homophilic interactions of rage in cell culture conditions, as well as rage ligand binding and hmgb1 binding to heparin.",PMC6165534,PMC6165534_0
"The study reveals that rage dimerization occurring in living cells can be inhibited by heparin, as well as that rage ligand binding can be inhibited by sulphated k5 polysaccharides.",PMC6165534,PMC6165534_1
"The study shows that rage–age interactions and hmgb1 binding to heparin can be inhibited by glycyrrhizin, suggesting that glycyrrhizin might inhibit rage signaling via interfering hmgb1–heparan sulphate interactions.",PMC6165534,PMC6165534_2
"The study demonstrates that a-box and the full length hmgb1 bind to heparin in a similar manner, and that their binding to heparin is inhibited by millimolar concentrations of glycyrrhizin.",PMC6165534,PMC6165534_3
"The study suggests that the a-box lacking heparin binding cationic amino acid residues in a linker sequence is still able to bind to heparin, as the a-box bound to a heparin–sepharose column and was eluted with the same concentration of glycyrrhizin as the control protein thrombin.",PMC6165534,PMC6165534_4
