"A study analyzed the effect of hashtag count, mention count, URL count, and attaching visual cues to tweets related to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) public health grand rounds and vital signs. URL links were found to increase retweet frequency for both corpora, while the effect of hashtag count and mention count differed between corpora.",PMC6748269,PMC6748269_0
"The study found that the presence of URL links increased engagement from Twitter users who follow CDC Twitter accounts, as these URL links could lead to additional sources of information, such as websites or other social media posts.",PMC6748269,PMC6748269_1
"The study also found that the effect of visual cues, such as images or videos, on retweet frequency varied depending on the specific cycle of the tweet. For the #CDCgrandrounds tweets, the attachment of visual cues increased the probability of retweeting in 28 of 58 cycles, with an effect observed in 24 cycles with a probability ratio (PR) between 1 and 3, and three cycles with a PR above 5. For the #vitalsigns tweets, the attachment of still images or videos increased the PR in 19 of 42 cycles, with a PR between 1 and 3 in six cycles, between 3 and 5 in seven cycles, and above 5 in six cycles.",PMC6748269,PMC6748269_2
"The study's findings suggest that the effect of hashtags and mentions on retweet frequency may be modified by the content or topic of the tweet. However, as the confidence intervals of most estimates overlap with each other, a multivariable analysis was not deemed informative due to the limited sample size and the nature of the sample.",PMC6748269,PMC6748269_3
"The authors recommend continuing to attach visual cues to tweets to increase engagement with Twitter users who follow CDC Twitter accounts, as this was found to have an effect at large. However, they also note that the effect of visual cues varied depending on the specific cycle of the tweet, and further studies could investigate other factors that can contribute to increasing retweet frequency of tweets posted by health agencies.",PMC6748269,PMC6748269_4
