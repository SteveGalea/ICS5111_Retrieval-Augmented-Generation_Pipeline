"In this study, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was a common cause of outpatient respiratory illness in adults aged 60 years and older, with RSV detected in 11% of those with medically attended acute respiratory illness. RSV was also more common in women compared with men.",PMC6306566,PMC6306566_0
The temporal trend in RSV incidence suggests an overall reduction in RSV after the 2011-2012 season in this community cohort.,PMC6306566,PMC6306566_1
"RSV was associated with moderate or serious outcomes, including change in therapy, hospital admission, and pneumonia, in over 80% of patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection. Serious outcomes occurred in nearly 1 in 5 patients with RSV infection, and patients with serious outcomes were significantly more likely to present with dyspnea and objective signs of lower respiratory tract involvement.",PMC6306566,PMC6306566_2
"Hospital admission was the most common serious outcome, and the risk of a serious outcome increased with age. RSV-associated moderate to severe lower respiratory tract illness was a useful surrogate measure to identify individuals at risk for more serious clinical endpoints in trials of vaccines and antivirals.",PMC6306566,PMC6306566_3
"The majority of outpatient RSV cases (64%) resulted in a moderate outcome, including a new prescription for antibiotics, antivirals, bronchodilators, or systemic corticosteroids. Over three-quarters of patients with RSV were treated with antibiotics, and more than half received bronchodilator or nebulizer treatment.",PMC6306566,PMC6306566_4
