"Study findings: This retrospective study of 21 research dogs revealed that 71% of them were seropositive for at least one of the three most common tick-borne pathogens: Ehrlichia canis, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, and Rickettsia rickettsii. However, active infection of dogs seropositive for E. Canis could not be confirmed due to the low likelihood that these dogs were vaccinated for B. Burgdorferi or due to immune suppression, stress, or cardiac cachexia.",PMC2691535,PMC2691535_0
"Study findings: The study found that many pathogens, including the three tick-borne pathogens examined, can cause chronic immune stimulation, which can expand the variability in hematologic, biochemical, and histopathologic parameters, making it less likely to reveal subtle differences and ultimately requiring increased numbers of dogs to achieve statistical significance.",PMC2691535,PMC2691535_1
"Study findings: The study found that most hematologic and biochemical parameters did not differ significantly between seropositive and seronegative dogs, and many values were within normal published ranges, except for hyperglobulinemia, which was associated with low albumin:globulin ratios, suggesting chronic immune stimulation, and was significant in dogs infected with E. Canis, B. Burgdorferi, and R. Rickettsii compared with those seronegative for all three pathogens.",PMC2691535,PMC2691535_2
"Study findings: The study found that beagle dogs experimentally infected with E. Canis develop transient proteinuria, predominantly albuminuria, and histopathologic renal interstitial changes characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, which can cause tissue injury and disease that may not be readily detectable by routine laboratory evaluations.",PMC2691535,PMC2691535_3
"Study findings: The study found that all three pathogens examined here are zoonotic, can cause human disease, and are the most frequent tick-borne agents in humans, with 21,304 cases of Lyme disease, 1843 cases of rocky mountain spotted fever, and 1284 cases of ehrlichiosis (granulocytic anaplasmosis due to A. Phagocytophilum and monoc",PMC2691535,PMC2691535_4
