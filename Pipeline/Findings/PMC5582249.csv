"The study identified three immunogenic epitopes in the plp protein, which is a major protein in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. These epitopes have high similarity with several antigenic bacterial and viral components, suggesting a role of molecular mimicry in the initiation of MS.",PMC5582249,PMC5582249_0
"The study found that the candidate epitope, plp58-74, could induce proliferation in MS patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), while it did not affect the PBMCs of healthy individuals.",PMC5582249,PMC5582249_1
"The study revealed that there is a cross reaction between plp139-151 and Acanthamoeba castellanii (ACA)83-95, both of which induce encephalitogenic autoimmune responses in experimental animal models.",PMC5582249,PMC5582249_2
"The study contributed to a better understanding and clarification of the mechanism of MS and the causes of MS. The results can be used to prevent the initiation of MS, immunotherapy, and individual medicine in future.",PMC5582249,PMC5582249_3
"The study allowed for the reliable and accurate prediction of consensus epitopes for cytotoxic and helper T cells based on susceptible alleles to MS, checking their matches in microbial components, without the need for synthesizing all plp fragments and examining their immunogenicity experimentally (in vitro). This approach allows for the development of peptide-based pharmacotherapy for MS and promises for personalized medicine in future.",PMC5582249,PMC5582249_4
