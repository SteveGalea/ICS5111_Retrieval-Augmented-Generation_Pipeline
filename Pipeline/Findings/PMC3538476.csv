"In the section on the comparison of patient- and healthcare worker-collected midturbinate nasal flocked swabs, a significant finding was that both methods had similar overall qualitative results and concordance, with slight differences in cp values due to varying levels of virus present, indicating a potential decrease in exposure to respiratory viruses such as influenza a and b through self-collection.",PMC3538476,PMC3538476_0
"Another important finding was that self-collection may provide a more time-efficient testing approach, potentially reducing wait times and decreasing the financial burden on healthcare systems.",PMC3538476,PMC3538476_1
"The study also highlighted the potential advantages of self-collection, such as reduced time spent in healthcare facilities, potentially decreasing influenza-associated hospitalizations and healthcare costs, as well as improved patient protection through better adherence to written instructions and minimization of unintentional exposures to respiratory viruses.",PMC3538476,PMC3538476_2
"The study also suggested that self-collection may be particularly useful in large-scale community-based respiratory virus testing programs, potentially alleviating resource constraints and reducing costs associated with healthcare worker training and supervision.",PMC3538476,PMC3538476_3
"The study also emphasized the importance of considering potential barriers to self-collection, such as low health literacy, limited access to healthcare facilities, and language barriers, and the need for developing appropriate models and strategies tailored to address these barriers.",PMC3538476,PMC3538476_4
