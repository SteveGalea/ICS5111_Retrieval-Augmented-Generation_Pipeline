"Study examined Twitter for public health surveillance during a mass gathering in Canada with two objectives: to explore feasibility of acquiring, categorizing, and using geolocated Twitter data, and to compare Twitter data against other data sources used for Pan Parapan American Games (P/PAG) surveillance.",PMC6964588,PMC6964588_0
"Syndrome definitions were created using keyword categorization to extract posts from Twitter. Categories were developed iteratively for four relevant syndromes: respiratory, gastrointestinal, heat-related illness, and influenza-like illness (ILI).",PMC6964588,PMC6964588_1
"Cross-correlation analyses of time series data were conducted between Twitter and comparator surveillance data sources: emergency department visits, telephone helpline calls, laboratory testing positivity rate, reportable disease data, and temperature.",PMC6964588,PMC6964588_2
Significant correlations were found between Twitter data and two routine data sources for heat alerts: telephone helpline calls (r=0.4) and temperature data (r=0.5).,PMC6964588,PMC6964588_3
"Study concluded that using simple syndromes based on keyword classification of geolocated tweets, they found a correlation between tweets and two routine data sources for heat alerts, the only public health event detected during P/PAG. Further research is needed to understand the role for Twitter in surveillance.",PMC6964588,PMC6964588_4
