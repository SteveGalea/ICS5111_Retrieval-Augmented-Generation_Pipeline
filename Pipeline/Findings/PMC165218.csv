"The study identified three distinct genetic clusters of nlv-bec viruses: a prototype virus, related to the classical nlv-bec (BEC/NB) strain of US origin, and two new BEC genotype-related virus strains, designated ""ohio"" strains, which are phylogenetically related to the BEC-NB strain and the human nlv-gi and nlv-gii viruses, respectively.",PMC165218,PMC165218_0
"The study found that calves less than 1 week old are at least as susceptible as calves 3 to 6 weeks old, without specific immunity, to BEC viruses.",PMC165218,PMC165218_1
"The study identified low or no BEC virus shedding in pooled herd samples collected from older calves (3 to 6 weeks of age) in the face of declining active immunity or exposure to new antigenically distinct virus strains, suggesting that infections in adult cattle occur more sporadically.",PMC165218,PMC165218_2
"The study found that the BEC virus shedding waned rapidly after introduction of calves into the all-in-all-out management systems used on the farms in the study, underlining the highly contagious nature of enteric caliciviruses.",PMC165218,PMC165218_3
"The study identified two distinct genetic clusters of nlv-bec viruses: a cluster related to the classical nlv-bec (BEC/NB) strain of US origin, and a second cluster, related to the BEC-NB strain and the human nlv-gi and nlv-gii viruses, respectively. The differences in orf-2, orf-3, and 3â€² UTRs noted between the jena virus and the na-2, cv95-oh, and cv186-oh nlv-bec are characteristic features of each nlv-bec genetic cluster.",PMC165218,PMC165218_4
