"The authors isolated and characterized a novel bat SL-CoV isolate, WIV16, which is the closest ancestor to date of SARS-CoVs.",PMC4810638,PMC4810638_0
"WIV16 is the closest strain to date of human SARS-CoVs with regard to ORF8, providing further evidence that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoVs.",PMC4810638,PMC4810638_1
"The WIV16 S gene is likely a recombinant of WIV1's gene and a recent ancestor of SARS-CoV's gene, as the WIV16 S1-NTD is very similar to that of SARS-CoVs, and the WIV16 RBD has 95% sequence identity to SARS-CoV RBDs.",PMC4810638,PMC4810638_2
"The WIV16 RBD predicts that it is likely to use ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor, and infection of HELA cells expressing ACE2 from human, civet, and Chinese horseshoe bat, respectively, confirmed this (Figure 1).",PMC4810638,PMC4810638_3
"WIV16 has the same host range as WIV1, indicating that it has the same broad host range as SARS-CoVs (Figure 2B).",PMC4810638,PMC4810638_4
