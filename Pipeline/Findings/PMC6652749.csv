"The study found that streptococcus suis, a bacterial pathogen commonly associated with porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), can colonize airway epithelial cells of porcine lungs and induce cytotoxic effects through activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which can contribute to the pathogenesis of PRDC.",PMC6652749,PMC6652749_0
"The study revealed that infection of porcine lungs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, a causative agent of PRDC, can enhance the colonization of airway epithelial cells by streptococcus suis by increasing the number of cfu and the percentage of bacterial fluorescence.",PMC6652749,PMC6652749_1
"The study demonstrated that infection of porcine lungs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus can also promote streptococcus suis-induced epithelial cell death by upregulating the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and caspase-8, which are crucial components of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.",PMC6652749,PMC6652749_2
"The study showed that infection of porcine lungs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus can lead to the downregulation of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin (CATHL3) and the upregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, which can further contribute to the pathogenesis of PRDC by impairing host defense mechanisms against bacterial infection.",PMC6652749,PMC6652749_3
"The study found that infection of porcine lungs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus can also increase the susceptibility of porcine airway epithelial cells to streptococcus suis-induced cytotoxic effects by downregulating the expression of CATHL3 and upregulating the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and caspase-8.",PMC6652749,PMC6652749_4
