"The study detected ev-gs in feces samples from 59 Japanese pigs, making it the first report of widespread prevalence in pigs in Japan. The study also identified a new serotype, Ishi-ka2, which shared high sequence homology with a strain from the same farm but was distinguished by over 25% nucleotide sequence divergence in the vp1 gene.",PMC5764308,PMC5764308_0
"The study revealed that ev-gs strains carrying the polyprotein (pp) gene, pp-cp, were detected in 17 of the 59 pigs, but in only four cases in pigs with diarrhea, suggesting that pp-cp is not a major determinant of virulence.",PMC5764308,PMC5764308_1
"The study found that ev-gs strains carrying pp-cp were simultaneously identified with other enteric viruses, including astrovirus, sapelovirus, and torovirus, in mixed infection cases.",PMC5764308,PMC5764308_2
"The study identified four new genotypes, including the Ishi-ka2 strain, and revealed high genetic diversity and a recombination hot-spot in the vp1-2a junction, suggesting that ev-gs are evolving independently and gaining genetic diversity via recombination events.",PMC5764308,PMC5764308_3
"The study highlighted the need for a comprehensive understanding of the genetic diversity and evolution of ev-gs through full genome analysis, as serological properties can be hypothesized based on sequence homology of the vp1 gene alone may not accurately reflect the pathogenicity of ev-gs strains.",PMC5764308,PMC5764308_4
