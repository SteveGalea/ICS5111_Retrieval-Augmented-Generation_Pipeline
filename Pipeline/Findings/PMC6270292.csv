"The study found that the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, Tian Xia Xie Jia Decoction (TJXJ), can suppress the production of Th2-associated cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, by downregulating the expression of their corresponding transcription factors, GATA3 and STAT6, respectively.",PMC6270292,PMC6270292_0
"A new TCM formula, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction (XCHUD), was found to inhibit the activation of the Th17 pathway by decreasing the expression of the Th17 cell marker, retinoic acid-inducible gene (RORC), and the production of IL-17.",PMC6270292,PMC6270292_1
"The study revealed that the TCM formula, Jia Wei Xiao Yao San (JWXYS), can suppress the activation of natural killer (NK) cells by downregulating the expression of the NK cell marker, CD161, and the production of the NK cell-derived cytotoxic molecule, perforin.",PMC6270292,PMC6270292_2
"The study showed that the TCM formula, Tian Ma Xie Jia Decoction (TMXJ), can reduce the expression of chemokine receptors, CCR3 and CXCR4, and the production of chemokines, CCL5 and CXCL1, respectively, by suppressing the activation of NF-ÎºB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.",PMC6270292,PMC6270292_3
"The study found that the TCM formula, Tian Xia Xie Jia Decoction (TJXJ), can decrease the production of Th2-associated cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, by downregulating the expression of their corresponding transcription factors, GATA3 and STAT6, respectively, through the suppression of the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway.",PMC6270292,PMC6270292_4
"The study found that the TCM formula, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction (XCHUD), can decrease the expression of the Th17 cell marker, RORC, and the production of IL-17 by suppressing the activation of the RORC signaling pathway.",PMC6270292,PMC6270292_5
