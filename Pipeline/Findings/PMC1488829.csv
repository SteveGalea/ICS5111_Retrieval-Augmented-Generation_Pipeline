"The study found that a combination of fluticasone and salmeterol (FPS) was more effective than either drug alone in reducing asthma exacerbations caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice. This synergistic effect was observed in terms of reducing airway hyperreactivity (AHR), lung inflammation, and RSV titers in the lungs.",PMC1488829,PMC1488829_0
The study showed that FPS treatment resulted in a significant decrease in RSV-induced inflammation and RSV titers compared to mice receiving the drugs individually. This suggests that the use of combination therapy can be effective in reducing virally-induced asthma exacerbations using already available therapies.,PMC1488829,PMC1488829_1
"The study found that FPS treatment reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the lungs of mice infected with RSV, indicating that the combination treatment can exert additional antiviral effects.",PMC1488829,PMC1488829_2
"The study demonstrated that FPS treatment decreased the expression of the inflammatory marker icam-1 in the lungs of mice infected with RSV, suggesting that the combination treatment can further reduce lung inflammation.",PMC1488829,PMC1488829_3
"The study showed that FPS treatment resulted in an increase in interleukin-4 (IL-4) production in the lungs of mice infected with RSV, which is a characteristic feature of the th2-type response observed in human infants suffering from acute RSV bronchiolitis. This suggests that the combination treatment can exert additional antiviral effects and may be effective in managing RSV-induced asthma exacerbations.",PMC1488829,PMC1488829_4
