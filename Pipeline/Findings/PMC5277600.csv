"This study reports the first evidence of hcov 229e circulation in patients with respiratory infections in Iran during autumn 2015. The virus was detected in 5.5% of the 270 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from three hospitals in Tehran, with a male predominance (85%) and a range of age between 12 and 75 years old.",PMC5277600,PMC5277600_0
"The study confirms the circulation of hcovs in Iran, as previously reported by other researchers in the country. However, the study highlights the need for further studies, including the isolation and molecular characterization of hcovs in Iran, to adequately assess the association between hcov infection and respiratory disease, as year-to-year variation in overall prevalence and type of circulating hcov can occur.",PMC5277600,PMC5277600_1
"The study also provides insights into the epidemiology and clinical knowledge of hcovs in Iran, indicating that hcov 229e is the only detected virus in the set of coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1, with hcov 229E being the predominant virus.",PMC5277600,PMC5277600_2
"The study suggests that hcovs, including hcov 229E, can lead to severe respiratory infections and hospitalization, as previously reported by other researchers in Iran.",PMC5277600,PMC5277600_3
"The study also highlights the advantages of nasopharyngeal sampling over oropharyngeal sampling for the identification of coronaviruses, as reported by other researchers in Iran and other studies conducted in other countries.",PMC5277600,PMC5277600_4
