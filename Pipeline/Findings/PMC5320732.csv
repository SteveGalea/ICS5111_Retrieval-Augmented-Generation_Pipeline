"Four bat liver samples tested positive for hepadnaviruses, with one strain designated BTHBVRS3364.",PMC5320732,PMC5320732_0
"One bat liver sample tested positive for hepevirus, designated BTHEVMD2350.",PMC5320732,PMC5320732_1
BTHBVRS3364 had the highest sequence identity with a previously reported hepadnavirus from the roundleaf bat in China.,PMC5320732,PMC5320732_2
"BTHEVMD2350 had the highest sequence identity with a hepevirus found in the serotine bat in Germany, but also exhibited high levels of divergence at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels.",PMC5320732,PMC5320732_3
"The discovery of BTHBVRS3364 supports the significance of host switches evolution in hepadnaviruses, opposing the co-evolutionary theory associated with them.",PMC5320732,PMC5320732_4
"According to the latest ICTV criteria, BTHEVMD2350 represents an independent genotype within the species Orthohepevirus D of the family Hepeviridae.",PMC5320732,PMC5320732_5
