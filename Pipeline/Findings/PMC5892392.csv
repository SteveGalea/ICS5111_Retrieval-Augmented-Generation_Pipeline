All modern cheetahs descend from a late Pleistocene bottleneck that reduced genomic diversity by 1/10th to 1/100th in the surviving species.,PMC5892392,PMC5892392_0
"The genetic loss was not rate-limiting in nature, meaning that ecological stabilization and habitat protection are key to cheetah conservation.",PMC5892392,PMC5892392_1
"African cheetahs rescued from the wild are suitable in genetic terms as founders of restored Asian populations since both African and Asian cheetahs descend from the recent population bottleneck of <12,000 years ago.",PMC5892392,PMC5892392_2
"A robust genetic assessment and informed interpretation are important for species preservation and stabilization of natural ecosystems, as genetic and genomic tools become better appreciated for their informed interpretations as well as their limitations.",PMC5892392,PMC5892392_3
"Suitable African cheetahs, themselves descendant of a successful natural history expansion, should be re-introduced to select Indian wildlife reserves, as genetic loss was not rate-limiting in nature and ecological stabilization and habitat protection are key to cheetah conservation.",PMC5892392,PMC5892392_4
