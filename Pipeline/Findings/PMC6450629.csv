"In the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the incidence of community-acquired acute respiratory infection is high, with an estimated 911 episodes per 1000 population annually. Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza virus are the most common bacterial and viral agents associated with community-acquired acute respiratory infection, respectively. Household transmission of respiratory pathogens is observed, but children do not appear to contribute significantly more to transmission than other age groups.",PMC6450629,PMC6450629_0
"The study provides insights into the epidemiology and burden of respiratory disease in a low-income, tropical country, considering a comprehensive range of pathogens, including both bacterial and viral agents, which is unusual in developing country settings.",PMC6450629,PMC6450629_1
"The study identifies high rates of antibiotic resistance, particularly to tetracycline, for streptococcus pneumoniae and influenzae.",PMC6450629,PMC6450629_2
"The study highlights the importance of considering the potential for emerging respiratory pathogens, as the study population is at high risk of infection with novel respiratory viruses, such as nipah and hantavirus.",PMC6450629,PMC6450629_3
"The study provides a resource for future investigations on influenza epidemiology, with the accumulating data on household-level transmission and the biobank repository of specimens.",PMC6450629,PMC6450629_4
