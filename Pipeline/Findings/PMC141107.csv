"The ability of a low-neurovirulence tmev to bind sialic acid is essential for its viability and is associated with increased virulence and targeting to specific tissues, such as the central nervous system and bile duct epithelium, in various animal virus infections (6, 7, 16, 19, 27).",PMC141107,PMC141107_0
"Low-neurovirulence strains of tmev bind Î±2,3-linked sialic acid moieties on n-linked oligosaccharides, while high-neurovirulence strains bind the proteoglycan heparan sulfate (32).",PMC141107,PMC141107_1
"Substitutions of parental virus residues q2161 and g2174 to a, r, or w and mutation of g2174 to f or w eliminated or reduced viral binding to bhk-21 cells, indicating reduced sialic acid binding compared to that of the parental virus (4, 5, 27).",PMC141107,PMC141107_2
The proximity of the low-neurovirulence tmev sialic acid-binding site to the pit raises the possibility that a sialylated receptor protein analogous to that of sialoglycophorin a is engaged for entry into mammalian cells (unpublished data from kumar et al.).,PMC141107,PMC141107_3
"In a separate study, a low-neurovirulence tmev similar to bean (vl virus), was adapted to lec-2 cells which lack cell surface sialic acid; this sialic acid-deficient virus was markedly attenuated after i.c. inoculation in mice (a.s.m. Kumar et al., unpublished data).",PMC141107,PMC141107_4
