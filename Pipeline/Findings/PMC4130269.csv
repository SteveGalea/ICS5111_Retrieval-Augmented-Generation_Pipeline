Yeast-expressed rbd proteins without glycosylation or with deleted or mutated glycosylation sites can still induce strong neutralizing antibody responses and protect animals from sars-cov infection.,PMC4130269,PMC4130269_0
"The yeast-expressed rbd protein without glycosylation at the n1 site, rbd219-n1, exhibited lower glycosylation levels, higher expression yield, and induced stronger rbd-specific antibody responses and more potent neutralizing antibodies against both pseudotyped and live sars-cov, making it a promising subunit vaccine candidate against sars-cov in humans.",PMC4130269,PMC4130269_1
"The rbd of sars-cov s-protein contains multiple conformation-dependent epitopes, and a mammalian cell-expressed rbd protein with high glycosylation was highly recognized by conformational anti-rbd mabs, further validating the ability of this deglycosylated protein to maintain antigenicity and functionality.",PMC4130269,PMC4130269_2
"The yeast-expressed rbd219-n1 vaccine candidate induced nt50 (50% neutralizing antibody titer) >1,000 of neutralizing antibody titers against the live sars-cov, demonstrating its prospect to efficiently protect immunized animals from an sars-cov challenge.",PMC4130269,PMC4130269_3
"The rbd219-n1 and rbd193-n1 vaccine candidates induced high and low neutralization titers, respectively, and among all the tested yeast-expressed rbds, rbd219-n1 elicited the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies against the live sars-cov, suggesting that removing the glycosylation site at the n1 site may help stabilize the overall structure of rbd219 and lead to high immunization titers.",PMC4130269,PMC4130269_4
