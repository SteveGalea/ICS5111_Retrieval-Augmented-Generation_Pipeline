"In the early stages of femoral head necrosis (FHN), conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the gold standard technique due to its high sensitivity (over 99%) and is recommended by both Steinkerg and ARCO classification systems.",PMC4832402,PMC4832402_0
"Conventional MRI can identify early stages of FHN in asymptomatic patients, and missed diagnoses in CT are common (up to 89%).",PMC4832402,PMC4832402_1
"Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can demonstrate an increase in diffusion in the epiphysis and metaphysis of the affected bone, which is likely due to the different cell population that constitutes the bone marrow and to a late identification of the pathologic process, when cells death with membranes lysis and bone marrow edema (BME) has already occurred.",PMC4832402,PMC4832402_2
"Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI can demonstrate decreased initial slope, enhancement ratio, and time to peak enhancement, which are associated with vegf increase and dna oxidative damage in a rabbit model of steroid-induced FHN.",PMC4832402,PMC4832402_3
"Perfusion MRI can demonstrate a decreased time to peak, enhancement slope, and ratio in patients with FHN, which are statistically different from results obtained in patients with subchondral insufficiency fractures (SIV) or transient bone marrow edema (TBME).",PMC4832402,PMC4832402_4
