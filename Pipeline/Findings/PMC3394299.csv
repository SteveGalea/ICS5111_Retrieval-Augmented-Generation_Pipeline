"Vigor, a genome annotation software, was developed to accurately predict protein coding genes and identify complex gene features for viruses with well-understood structures and complex gene features. Vigor's predictions were validated by comparing them with homologous proteins in genbank for five different viruses, and it was shown to accurately define the start and stop codons of genes in the designated viral genomes.",PMC3394299,PMC3394299_0
"For the paramyxovirus family, Vigor predicted 62 out of 311 genes annotated in genbank for rubella virus, and the start codons of 13 genes defined by Vigor were different from genbank annotations. Vigor also predicted 33 new genes that were not annotated in genbank for this virus family.",PMC3394299,PMC3394299_1
"For norovirus and alphavirus, Vigor predicted the correct start and stop codons of genes in the designated viral genomes, and it accurately identified the complex gene features like rna editing, stop codon read-through, alternative splicing, and alternative translation initiation.",PMC3394299,PMC3394299_2
"For respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), Vigor predicted 522 genes that were the same as the annotations in genbank for the m2-2 gene, and it predicted 33 new genes that were not annotated in genbank. Vigor also showed that rsv is still responsible for >90,000 hospitalizations in new borns and children each year in the US, despite a few rsv vaccines being available.",PMC3394299,PMC3394299_3
"For parainfluenza virus and sendai virus, Vigor predicted the correct start and stop codons of genes in the designated viral genomes, and it accurately identified the complex gene features like rna editing, stop codon read-through, alternative splicing, and alternative translation initiation for the c, y1, and y2 genes, which overlap with the p gene but with different start codons and different reading frames.",PMC3394299,PMC3394299_4
