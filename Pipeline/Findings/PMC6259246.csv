This study investigated the effects of a Ts (Toona sinensis) leaf extract on oral squamous cell carcinoma cells and normal oral epithelial cells.,PMC6259246,PMC6259246_0
The study found that Ts induces cell death in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells but not in normal oral epithelial cells.,PMC6259246,PMC6259246_1
"Flow cytometry analysis revealed that Ts induces cell death via apoptosis in the Um1 cell line and via late apoptosis and/or necrosis in the Um2, Scc4, and Scc9 cell lines.",PMC6259246,PMC6259246_2
"The study identified gallic acid as the major bioactive compound present in Ts leaf extract, Ts-1, which induces anti-neoplastic activity by up-regulating pro-apoptotic genes and down-regulating anti-apoptotic genes, resulting in cell death.",PMC6259246,PMC6259246_3
