"In a study on the use of big data platforms for public health education and online surveillance in China, the authors found that the use of big data platforms for public health education and online surveillance is becoming increasingly popular in China due to the availability of large amounts of internet search data and the increasing prevalence of infectious diseases. The authors also identified 13 regions with higher average attention to the Ebola outbreak in China from July 30 to September 14, 2014, and the spatio-temporal analysis suggested that the 15 days after the peak of the BDI and SMI were critical periods for infectious diseases with imported risks, requiring the adoption of necessary health education interventions in these clustered regions.",PMC4997466,PMC4997466_0
"In the same study, the authors found that the highest BDI was observed in Guangdong province, which has the largest number of internet users in China, and the highest average BDI in a province was also observed in Guangdong, indicating that the opportunities brought about by China's booming economy may have induced overreaction by local netizens in this region. The authors also found that the highest average BDI in a city was observed in Beijing, the political center of China, and the highest average BDI in a province and city was observed in Shanghai, the economic center of China.",PMC4997466,PMC4997466_1
"In a study on the use of big data platforms for online surveillance and public health education in China, the authors found that online surveillance based on big data platforms can be an innovative approach to purposefully perform public communication and health education, which can help to avoid the occurrence of public panics and dispel rumors, especially in regions with higher average attention to the Ebola outbreak. The authors also found that the absence of clinically characteristic data and detailed distribution information prevented the performance of in-depth correlative analysis in their study.",PMC4997466,PMC4997466_2
"In the same study, the authors found that the average BDI and SMI were not calculated in their analysis due to the absence of deleted Ebola-related blogs, and the average BDI and SMI were not verified due to the absence of clinically characteristic data and detailed distribution information. The authors also found that their study only focused on Chinese websites and netizens from the Chinese mainland, which could not depict the public reaction from internet users of websites in English or other languages, such as Twitter and Facebook.",PMC4997466,PMC4997466_3
