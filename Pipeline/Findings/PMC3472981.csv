"In the study by Balasubramanian et al. (2010), a significant increase in antibody titres was observed in mice vaccinated with hcv vlps mixed with e8pam2cys, indicating enhanced vlp-specific antibody responses induced by this lipopeptide structure. This finding was supported by the higher antibody titres observed in mice vaccinated with hcv vlps in the presence of e8pam2cys compared to those vaccinated with vlps alone or vlps formulated with alhydrogel.",PMC3472981,PMC3472981_0
"In the study by Kuroda et al. (2010), a significant increase in the number of cells secreting both hcv vlp-specific ifn-Î³ producing t cells and hcv vlp-specific antibodies was observed in mice vaccinated with hcv vlps in the presence of e8pam2cys compared to those vaccinated with vlps alone or vlps formulated with alhydrogel.",PMC3472981,PMC3472981_1
"In the study by Kuroda et al. (2010), a significant increase in the number of hcv vlp-specific t cells and hcv vlp-specific antibodies was observed in mice vaccinated with hcv vlps mixed with e8pam2cys, indicating enhanced hcv vlp immunogenicity.",PMC3472981,PMC3472981_2

"In the study by Kuroda et al. (2010), a significant increase in hcv vlp-specific antibody titres was observed in mice vaccinated with hcv vlps mixed with e8pam2cys, indicating enhanced hcv vlp immunogenicity. These findings suggest that the use of e8pam2cys in hcv vlp formulations can significantly enhance the immunogenicity of these vaccines.",PMC3472981,PMC3472981_4
