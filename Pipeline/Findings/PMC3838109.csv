"The study identifies four antiviral proteins, ifitm1, -2, -3, and -5, in the chicken genome, and demonstrates that chicken ifitm3 has an antiviral activity similar to that of human ifitm3. This finding suggests that the antiviral activity of the ifitm2 and ifitm3 proteins is conserved in chicken.",PMC3838109,PMC3838109_0
"The study shows that chifitm2 and chifitm3 are localized to the plasma membrane, and chifitm3 is able to restrict influenza virus infection in vitro. This finding suggests that chicken ifitm proteins are capable of restricting diverse viruses that enter cells through the acidic endosome pathway.",PMC3838109,PMC3838109_1
"The study identifies avian ifitm genes at a conserved locus on chromosome 5, and shows that duck ifitm2 and ifitm3 are increased in response to infection with two h5n1 strains of avian influenza virus. This finding suggests that control of animal pathogens, especially those with zoonotic potential, is a key component of ensuring human health and food security, and that breeding for enhanced activity in ifitm variants will improve disease resistance in chickens.",PMC3838109,PMC3838109_2
"The study shows that df-1 chicken cells constitutively express chifitm3, and this is able to restrict influenza virus infection in vitro. This finding suggests that the level of antiviral activity and the proposed indirect mechanism of ifitm protein restriction (12, 13) are conserved in chicken and humans, separated by 310 million years of evolution (31).",PMC3838109,PMC3838109_3
