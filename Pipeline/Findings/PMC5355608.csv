"The study identified a novel mechanism by which the viral protein p32, encoded by the porcine circovirus (PCV) genome, inhibits the production of type I interferons (IFNs) by suppressing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3).",PMC5355608,PMC5355608_0
"The study revealed that PCV-infected cells exhibit a marked reduction in IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA levels, as well as decreased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3, which can be reversed by treatment with a p32-specific inhibitor.",PMC5355608,PMC5355608_1
The study also showed that p32 expression is required for PCV replication and that p32-deficient PCV strains exhibit a significant reduction in viral titers.,PMC5355608,PMC5355608_2
"Furthermore, the study found that the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) protein nsp1, which is homologous to p32, also inhibits IFN production and IRF3 phosphorylation, suggesting a conserved mechanism in coronaviruses.",PMC5355608,PMC5355608_3
The study suggests that the p32-mediated inhibition of IFN production may contribute to the pathogenesis of PCV and PRCV infections by facilitating viral replication and immune evasion.,PMC5355608,PMC5355608_4
