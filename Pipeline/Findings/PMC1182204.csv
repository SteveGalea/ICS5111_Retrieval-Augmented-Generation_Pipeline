"The newly developed sars-cov nδ121 protein-based igg elisa, which uses a truncated n protein, is more sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of sars-cov infection compared to other methods.",PMC1182204,PMC1182204_0
"Using this new method, 11 out of 175 serum samples from probable sars cases showed igg seroconversion, with titers ranging from 600 to 204,800, and the recombinant nδ121 protein-based elisa was more sensitive and could detect seroconversion earlier than the virus-infected cell lysate-based elisa system.",PMC1182204,PMC1182204_1
"The study found that four symptom-free hcws from Vietnam who had direct contact with sars patients had developed antibody against sars-cov, indicating that subclinical sars-cov infection actually does exist, although at quite a low rate.",PMC1182204,PMC1182204_2
"Contact-tracing data revealed that all four symptom-free hcws from this study who had antibodies against sars-cov were in direct contact with the index case, but they did not develop sars but experienced only subclinical infection, as proven by seroconversion.",PMC1182204,PMC1182204_3
"The study suggests that subclinical and mild forms of sars-cov infection are more common than sars pneumonia, and this may be the reason why control measures, such as quarantining patients, worked effectively to contain the outbreak in Vietnam, because only very few people may have acquired immunity through subclinical infections and, hence, the majority of the population might remain susceptible to the disease.",PMC1182204,PMC1182204_4
