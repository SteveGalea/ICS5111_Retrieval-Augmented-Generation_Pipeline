"In both forms of acute pancreatitis, there is a significant depletion of circulating lymphocytes, with a more profound depletion in severe acute pancreatitis. In the early period of pancreatitis, the magnitude of peripheral depletion is similar for T- and B- lymphocytes, but in the late stage of severe acute pancreatitis, B- lymphocytes are particularly depleted.",PMC4088202,PMC4088202_0
"In both forms of acute pancreatitis, serum levels of IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 are significantly increased, with the highest values found in severe acute pancreatitis.",PMC4088202,PMC4088202_1
"In both forms of acute pancreatitis, there is a strong shift in the CD7+/CD19+ ratio, implying a predominance of T- over B- lymphocytes in severe acute pancreatitis. Among T- lymphocytes, there is a significant depletion of CD4+ cells in mild and severe acute pancreatitis, while CD8+ cells are in the normal range.",PMC4088202,PMC4088202_2
"In both forms of acute pancreatitis, there is an overwhelming pro-inflammatory response, which can be followed by a second response that involves down-regulation of IFN-γ and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-β.",PMC4088202,PMC4088202_3
"In both forms of acute pancreatitis, there is a significant activation of T- and B- lymphocytes, which may be explained by the significant activation of T- as well as B- lymphocytes, despite a significant decrease in the number of circulating lymphocytes. The data obtained in this study suggest that the depletion of lymphocytes in acute pancreatitis may result from both excessive apoptosis and migration to the site of inflammation.",PMC4088202,PMC4088202_4
