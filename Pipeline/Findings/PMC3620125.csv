"The study found that dna vaccines delivered by the biojector® device, which uses a small orifice under pressure to deliver liquid vaccines parenterally, have a significantly higher immunogenicity compared to dna vaccines delivered by the traditional needle and syringe (n/s) method. This was observed in both human and nonhuman primate studies.",PMC3620125,PMC3620125_0
"The study also found that the biojector® delivery method was associated with improved antibody, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and CD8+ T cell responses post boosting with rad5, suggesting that transfection efficiency is a key factor in improving the potency of dna vaccines.",PMC3620125,PMC3620125_1
"The study noted that, historically, administration of injectable vaccines has primarily been accomplished with a needle and syringe (n/s), but that needle-free injection systems, such as the biojector® device, offer advantages such as avoiding the problem of visp/r (vector-specific immunity) and needle-stick injuries, as well as reducing the risk of proper needle disposal.",PMC3620125,PMC3620125_2
"The study also noted that, while the lack of vector-specific immunity, ease of manufacturing, and stability of plasmid dna makes it an ideal vaccine platform, the problem of visp/r (vector-specific immunity) could be largely avoided by using dna vaccines delivered by needle-free injection systems, such as the biojector® device.",PMC3620125,PMC3620125_3
"The study further observed that, in addition to dna vaccines delivered by needle-free injection systems, other approaches, such as electroporation, are being developed to improve dna vaccine transfection efficiency, although the results in human studies to date have been modest.",PMC3620125,PMC3620125_4
