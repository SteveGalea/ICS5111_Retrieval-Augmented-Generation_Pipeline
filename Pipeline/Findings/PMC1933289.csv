"A small cell-permeating peptide inhibitor, d-Jun kinase inhibitor-1 (d-Jnki-1), selectively prevents phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun and reduces neuronal apoptosis following reovirus type 3 (T3) infection in vitro.",PMC1933289,PMC1933289_0
"Infection with T3A or T3D in mice, followed by d-Jnki-1 treatment, results in a dramatic reduction in T3-induced apoptosis, neuronal cell death, and tissue injury in vivo, leading to prolonged survival of infected mice.",PMC1933289,PMC1933289_1
"Inhibition of Jun kinase activation with d-Jnki-1 in T3A-infected neurons is greatly diminished with Jun kinase inhibition alone, suggesting that Jun kinase activation is important in virus-induced apoptosis and that inhibition of Jun kinase with a small peptide inhibitor that prevents phosphorylation results in diminished apoptosis and decreased mitochondrial release of proapoptotic proteins.",PMC1933289,PMC1933289_2
"D-Jun kinase inhibitor-1 therapy does not alter viral titer or distribution of viral antigen in mice infected with T3, indicating that injury from viral infection does not result merely from viral replication but from the associated activation of a variety of host cell signaling events that ultimately lead to cell dysfunction or death.",PMC1933289,PMC1933289_3
"Targeted inhibition of Jun kinase activation during neuroinvasive viral infection may provide a neuroprotective effect that could reduce infection-associated morbidity, such as neuropsychiatric changes, seizures, paralysis, weakness, parkinsonism, or other movement disorders, by inhibiting a process that the virus actively induces following infection, thereby reducing or slowing the ability of the virus to spread to neighboring cells.",PMC1933289,PMC1933289_4
