"Multiplex RT-PCR on DNA chips allows for the simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses, including parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, and 3, influenza A and B viruses, and RSV.",PMC2168492,PMC2168492_0
"The DNA chip technique displays high specificity and positive predictive value for RSV, similar to the IF antibody test, with strong agreement between the two techniques.",PMC2168492,PMC2168492_1
"The DNA chip technique avoids the subjectivity inherent to IF and is not influenced by observer experience, but is more laborious and takes longer than IF.",PMC2168492,PMC2168492_2
"The DNA chip technique detected 34 RSVs, one influenza A virus, and one joint influuenza B virus-RSV infection, while the IF test detected 38 RSVs and one influenza A virus.",PMC2168492,PMC2168492_3
"Six nasopharyngeal lavage specimens identified as positive by IF were detected as negative by the DNA chip, with four deemed false positives and two deemed false negatives.",PMC2168492,PMC2168492_4
