"A study by Wang et al. (2014) in lung transplant recipients found that 40% of patients experienced secondary viral infections during follow-up monitoring, with a median viral shedding duration of 2 weeks. The majority (7 of 9) of these new viral episodes were asymptomatic.",PMC4629250,PMC4629250_0
"The study by Wang et al. (2014) used a patient self-collection method combined with sensitive rt-pcr for longitudinal monitoring of upper respiratory viral infection in solid organ transplant recipients. This methodology was feasible, convenient, and patient-acceptable, with high compliance rates and patient-reported symptom burden reductions concomitant with viral load decreases.",PMC4629250,PMC4629250_1
The study by Wang et al. (2014) found that the duration of rhinovirus infection was longer than that of other respiratory infections. This finding should be interpreted cautiously and verified in future larger studies.,PMC4629250,PMC4629250_2
"The study by Wang et al. (2014) demonstrated the generalizability of their findings, as they used a prospective study design, a set of highly sensitive and previously well-validated PCR assays, and had high compliance rates with monitoring.",PMC4629250,PMC4629250_3
The study by Wang et al. (2014) found that the use of this self-collection method combined with sensitive RT-PCR for longitudinal monitoring of upper respiratory viral infection in solid organ transplant recipients could potentially provide a patient-acceptable and useful means of assessing response to therapies such as new antiviral agents or reductions in immunosuppression.,PMC4629250,PMC4629250_4
