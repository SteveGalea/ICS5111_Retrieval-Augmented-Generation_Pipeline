"Soluble forms of viral envelope proteins can divert fc-mediated effector functions away from infected cells by occupying neutralizing antibodies or by competing for antibody binding sites, as observed in several viruses, including rsv, hiv-1, and ebov.",PMC6789852,PMC6789852_0
"Endocytosis of viral envelope proteins, either spontaneously or induced by antibody binding, can reduce fc-mediated effector functions, including adcc, adcml, and phagocytosis, as observed in hiv-1, herpesviruses, and pseudorabies virus.",PMC6789852,PMC6789852_1
"The internalization of antibody-bound viral envelope proteins in an epitope-specific conformation-dependent manner can enhance the efficiency of fc-mediated effector functions, as observed in hiv-1.",PMC6789852,PMC6789852_2
"The combination of antibodies targeting different non-overlapping epitopes against viral infections, including hiv-1, chikungunya virus, and influenza a virus, can improve antibody therapeutic activity by limiting viral resistance and extending their therapeutic effect.",PMC6789852,PMC6789852_3
"The modification of antibody glycosylation in fc-mediated effector functions, such as the presence or absence of fucose and sialic acid, can significantly impact their efficacy against virally infected cells, as observed in hiv-1, rsv, and dengue virus.",PMC6789852,PMC6789852_4
