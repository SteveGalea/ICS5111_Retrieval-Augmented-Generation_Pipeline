"In the study, the authors found that a new mechanism, nonstop mRNA stimulation, decreases the synthesis of the out-of-frame polypeptide and stimulates frameshifting in the context of the c-chord of the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus.",PMC3443137,PMC3443137_0
"The authors discovered that a one-base substitution 11 nucleotides downstream of the c-chord resulted in a 40% reduction in TBE virus activity, which is likely due to an effect on frameshifting.",PMC3443137,PMC3443137_1
"The study suggests that the stalled ribosomes on the poly(a) tail of c5 TBE mRNA slow down the movement of upstream ribosomes, resulting in (i) greatly reduced synthesis of the out-of-frame polypeptide and (ii) pausing of ribosomes at the frameshift signal, which would stimulate net -1 slippage back into the TBE reading frame.",PMC3443137,PMC3443137_2
"The authors found that the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting in the context of the c-chord is relatively high, but the low level of TBE expression (0.1% of a wild-type virus) is biologically relevant, as it is sufficient to permit some reactivation from latency in mouse ganglia, while an isogenic truly TBE- mutant does not reactivate.",PMC3443137,PMC3443137_3
"The study suggests that ribosomal frameshifting stimulated by nonstop mRNA may occur more generally and that at least some transcripts thought to be noncoding or monocistronic might express low, but biologically relevant levels of novel polypeptides because of nonstop stimulation of translational recoding.",PMC3443137,PMC3443137_4
