"During the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea, super-spreading events fueled the epidemic. Approximately 20% of infected individuals were responsible for 80% of transmissions, and hospital-acquired infections were common.",PMC4945730,PMC4945730_0
"In the Korean outbreak, the case fatality rate among senior patients with underlying diseases was 48.2%. Patients aged 60 years or older without underlying diseases had a 1.8% case fatality rate, while those younger than 60 years with underlying diseases had a 13.6% case fatality rate. Senior patients were thus 9.3-fold (95% confidence interval, 5.3–16.9) more likely to die compared to younger patients, while the presence of underlying diseases resulted in a 7.8-fold (95% confidence interval, 4.0–16.7) higher likelihood of fatality.",PMC4945730,PMC4945730_1
"In the Korean outbreak, hospital rooms had more than 4 beds per room, and family members or privately hired health care aides usually stayed with the patients in these crowded hospital rooms. This increased vulnerability to easier viral transmission as a result of overcrowding has long been considered a common occurrence at larger hospitals.",PMC4945730,PMC4945730_2
"To prevent future infectious disease outbreaks in Korea, several strategies might be adopted, including proper education on newly spreading diseases to healthcare workers, mandatory travel history checking policies, and proper training on putting on and taking off personal protective equipment.",PMC4945730,PMC4945730_3
"Almost all secondary infected Korean MERS-CoV cases were patients, healthcare workers, or visiting family members or friends who were exposed to source patients in crowded hospital environments such as multiple occupancy rooms and emergency rooms. Therefore, stronger policies need to be in place to initially maintain patients with acute febrile and/or respiratory illness in single patient rooms (preemptive isolation), followed by a move to multiple occupancy room, depending on infectiousness. Regulations and restrictions on visiting acquaintances in hospital are also needed.",PMC4945730,PMC4945730_4
