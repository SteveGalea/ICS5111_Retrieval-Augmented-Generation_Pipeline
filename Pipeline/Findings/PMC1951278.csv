"The present study demonstrates for the first time that gammaretroviral vectors produced by nih 3t3-based packaging cell lines bind to the extracellular matrix (ECM) fibronectin (fn) matrix of nih 3t3 cells, and that this binding is important for efficient infection of these cells.",PMC1951278,PMC1951278_0
The study shows that binding of gammaretroviral vectors to ECM fn occurs through virus-associated heparan sulfate or virus-associated ECM fn.,PMC1951278,PMC1951278_1
"The study suggests that ECM fn assists in efficient infection of nih 3t3 cells by immobilizing viruses at the ECM fn, which would not only affect their movement at the cell surface but probably also their entry kinetics and infectious half-lives.",PMC1951278,PMC1951278_2
"The study also shows that inhibition of binding to ECM fn significantly reduces a-gamma-retrovirus (a-MLV) infection of nih 3t3 cells, suggesting that the ECM fn matrix could protect cells against efficient infection with viruses that are not able to bind to ECM fn.",PMC1951278,PMC1951278_3
"The study suggests that ECM fn binding is not restricted to retroviruses, as the envelope protein of influenza A virus binds to ECM fn, and entry via caveolae is an additional entry route for influenza virus.",PMC1951278,PMC1951278_4
"The study suggests that ECM fn binding is a general mechanism for transport of ECM fn-bound viruses, bacteria, and other ligands into cells.",PMC1951278,PMC1951278_5
"The study shows that ECM fn turnover occurs via a caveolae-dependent process, and after this first attachment, the viral particles are transported to caveolae.",PMC1951278,PMC1951278_6
The study suggests that the ECM fn matrix has a great impact on viral infections and could be a target for developing new antiviral therapies.,PMC1951278,PMC1951278_7
The study highlights the importance of characterizing the ECM fn matrix when interpreting virus-cell binding studies and in particular when creating retroviral vectors targeting specific cell types for gene therapy applications.,PMC1951278,PMC1951278_8
The study suggests that the ECM fn matrix could protect cells against efficient infection with viruses that are not able to bind to ECM fn.,PMC1951278,PMC1951278_9
