"A new isothermal amplification method, polymerase cross-linking spiral reaction (PCLSR), has been developed for the detection of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in pigs and wild boars.",PMC5309890,PMC5309890_0
"The PCLSR method involves a simple one-step process that can be performed at a low cost, as it does not require a thermal cycler or a water bath.",PMC5309890,PMC5309890_1
The PCLSR method can be used to detect ASFV at a low temperature (55.0°C to 66.0°C) and for extended periods (30 to 90 minutes) without the need for complex equipment.,PMC5309890,PMC5309890_2
"The PCLSR method can be used to detect ASFV in both field and laboratory samples, including those with low virus loads.",PMC5309890,PMC5309890_3
"The PCLSR method has been shown to have high sensitivity, as it can detect as few as seven copies of ASFV DNA in a reaction volume of just 15 microlitres.",PMC5309890,PMC5309890_4
The PCLSR method has been validated using a variety of ASFV strains and samples from both pigs and wild boars.,PMC5309890,PMC5309890_5
"The PCLSR method has been optimized to provide reproducible results and to minimize the risk of contamination and sample cross-contamination during the extraction, purification, and sequencing processes.",PMC5309890,PMC5309890_6
"The PCLSR method has been shown to be a reliable and cost-effective alternative to traditional ASFV detection methods, particularly in resource-limited settings where ASFV remains a major challenge for animal health and food safety.",PMC5309890,PMC5309890_7
"The PCLSR method has been developed as a result of collaboration between researchers from different institutions and countries, demonstrating the importance of international cooperation in addressing global health challenges.",PMC5309890,PMC5309890_8
"The PCLSR method has the potential to contribute to the development of more efficient and effective strategies for the control and eradication of ASFV, as well as to improve our understanding of the epidemiology and ecology of this important zoonotic pathogen.",PMC5309890,PMC5309890_9
