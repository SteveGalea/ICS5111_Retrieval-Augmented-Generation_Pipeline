"The study found that clinical case finding detected inhalational anthrax outbreaks on average 3.7-4.6 days after the release of spores, and the ability of syndromic surveillance to detect an outbreak before clinical case finding was influenced by both specificity and release size, with specificity being the predominant factor.",PMC3291344,PMC3291344_0
"The study showed that syndromic surveillance could detect an inhalational anthrax outbreak before clinical case finding in as many as half of simulated outbreaks, but the potential detection benefit of syndromic surveillance compared with clinical case finding depended critically on the specificity and sensitivity at which a surveillance system operated and on the size of the outbreak.",PMC3291344,PMC3291344_1
"The study found that to help detect outbreaks more rapidly, future research should examine the cost-effectiveness of syndromic surveillance and explore approaches to linking syndromic surveillance and clinical case finding more closely.",PMC3291344,PMC3291344_2
"The study revealed that the detection benefit of syndromic surveillance compared with clinical case finding was influenced strongly by the specificity at which a surveillance system operated, and public health authorities should be aware that the potential detection benefit of syndromic surveillance compared with clinical case finding is influenced critically by the specificity at which a surveillance system operates.",PMC3291344,PMC3291344_3
"The study suggested that syndromic surveillance may also be useful for applications other than detecting an outbreak caused by bioterrorism, such as for ruling out the existence of an outbreak or for evaluating the effect of a public health intervention.",PMC3291344,PMC3291344_4
