"The study tested the combination of hydroxyl-methylfurfural (HMF) and glutathione (GSH) in two doses to explore their protective effect against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) hepatotoxicity in rats, comparing with the standard drug sodium succinate (SS).",PMC5962645,PMC5962645_0
"The study measured serum biochemical parameters, tissue parameters, and histological study using light and electron microscope.",PMC5962645,PMC5962645_1
The study found that the combination was more effective than HMF and GSH alone in all measured parameters.,PMC5962645,PMC5962645_2
"The study observed that the liver and kidney cells appearance under light microscope showed that the combination-treated groups indicated resemblance to the normal group, while the electron microscope showed little cellular deterioration with some accumulation of small electro-dense materials.",PMC5962645,PMC5962645_3
"The study concluded that the combination was superior to the used combination in the two used doses in all measured parameters, but si was still superior to the combination in all measured parameters.",PMC5962645,PMC5962645_4
