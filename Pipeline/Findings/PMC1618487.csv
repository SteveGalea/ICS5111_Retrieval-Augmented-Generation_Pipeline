"In a study examining the spread of infectious diseases on random and scale-free networks, it was found that in random networks, epidemic spread is much slower, and the average degree of new infectious nodes is close to the average degree k=〈k〉. This is due to the relatively slow time-scale of the disease and the virtually degree-independent spread of the disease, which helps contact tracing to follow the disease closely and to control it if the tracing rate is high enough.",PMC1618487,PMC1618487_0
"In scale-free networks, the disease turnover time is fast, and the disease preferentially spreads to nodes with high degree. However, highly connected nodes are typically traced at a later disease stage, and only ‘intelligent’ tracing (for example through prior knowledge of who may be most highly connected) would be effective. Examination of disease transmission on different network topologies can help identify trademark signatures of different disease models spreading on different network architectures.",PMC1618487,PMC1618487_1
"The average degree of exposed and traced nodes is delayed with respect to the degree of traced and infectious nodes in scale-free networks. This is directly connected to the latency period, since infectious nodes traced at a given time in the epidemic represent a set of nodes that were infected on average a time lat_p earlier in the epidemic, and therefore are of higher average degree than the traced and exposed nodes.",PMC1618487,PMC1618487_2
"While epidemic spread on scale-free networks has recently been the subject of much interest, to our knowledge there has been no quantitative comparison of the differences in disease control efficacy on scale-free and random networks. The main advantage of contact tracing on both network types is that it can make a real difference if the tracing rate of susceptible nodes is low. However, should contacts between nodes be highly clustered, the removal of susceptible nodes can reduce the local susceptible neighbourhood surrounding infectious nodes, rendering it an effective means of disease control.",PMC1618487,PMC1618487_3
"In a study examining disease transmission on different network topologies, it was found that a major role in infectious disease spread is played by the underlying contact structure. However, in most cases, the exact contact structure is difficult to determine. Understanding how to best use the available data about a network on which disease can spread in order to better prevent or control epidemics is, therefore, imperative. The study suggests that by analyzing disease",PMC1618487,PMC1618487_4
