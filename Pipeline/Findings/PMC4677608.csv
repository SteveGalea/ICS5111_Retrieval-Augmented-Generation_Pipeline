"The study found that canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) was significantly associated with the presence of canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRD) in dogs after adjustment for the effect of age, fertility, and dog size.",PMC4677608,PMC4677608_0
"The study also reported that canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCOV) approached significance in terms of association with the presence of CIRD, but further studies are needed to determine its role in CIRD.",PMC4677608,PMC4677608_1
"Mycoplasma cynos, a common pathogen in dogs, was found in 81% of affected dogs and 73% of controls, but there was no significant association between its presence and CIRD.",PMC4677608,PMC4677608_2
"The study found that Bordetella bronchiseptica, a well-established pathogen in CIRD, had a similar detection rate in CIRD-positive and CIRD-negative dogs.",PMC4677608,PMC4677608_3
"The study did not identify statistically significant interactions among pathogens in this study, but co-infections in this study were common, largely because of the high prevalence of mycoplasma. The study also highlighted the need for more strict definition of the source population in future studies of this nature to improve study validity.",PMC4677608,PMC4677608_4
