"The study aimed to create a synthetic clone of the MERS-CoV virus, as well as deletion and expression constructs for the n and rfp genes.",PMC3791741,PMC3791741_0
"A mutation was found in the S gene at position g27162a, which resulted in a stop codon at position 108 in ORF5.",PMC3791741,PMC3791741_1
"To replace ORF5 with the RFP gene, one amplicon was generated by amplifying the F plasmid with primers emc f+1376 and emc f-1140.",PMC3791741,PMC3791741_2
"To delete ORFs 3-5, the MERS-CoV F plasmid was amplified with primer m13f1 and primer emc f-1140.",PMC3791741,PMC3791741_3
"To detect leader-containing RNAs, intracellular RNA was isolated using trizol reagent and transferred to a brightstar-plus membrane for 3-4 hours and then cross-linked to the membrane using UV light. The blot was prehybridized and probed with a MERS-CoV n gene-specific biotinylated oligodeoxynucleotide probe, after washing with 1x PBS and lysed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris·HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholine, and 0.1% SDS. Postnuclear supernatants were then added to an equal volume of 5 mm EDTA, 0.9% SDS, resulting in a final SDS concentration of 0.5%. Samples were then heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 90 °C at BSL3 before removal. At BSL2, samples were again heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 90 °C before use. Equivalent sample volumes were loaded onto 7.5% criterion gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). For detecting MERS-CoV antigens, blots were probed with polyclonal mouse antisera obtained after vaccination of mice with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles that express the MERS-CoV S",PMC3791741,PMC3791741_4
