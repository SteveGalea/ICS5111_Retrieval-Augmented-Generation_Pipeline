"Glycyrrhizin, a major constituent of the traditional herbal medicine licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra), inhibits the replication of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus in lung-derived A549 cells at therapeutically relevant concentrations.",PMC3096629,PMC3096629_0
"Glycyrrhizin also interferes with H5N1-induced activation of the redox-sensitive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38 and pJNK, and nuclear export of viral RNA nucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) in H5N1-infected cells, indicating that glycyrrhizin may serve as a lead structure for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs.",PMC3096629,PMC3096629_1
"In contrast to glycyrrhizin, the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) failed to inhibit H5N1 replication or H5N1-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human monocyte-derived macrophages.",PMC3096629,PMC3096629_2
"Glycyrrhizin diminished H5N1-induced cellular production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in concentrations that did not interfere with H5N1 replication in lung cells, suggesting that H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression is more sensitive to inhibition of ROS formation than H5N1 replication.",PMC3096629,PMC3096629_3
"Glycyrrhizin represents a potential additional treatment option that interferes with both H5N1 replication and H5N1-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung cells, as other immunomodulatory treatment regimens failed to protect from lethal influenza virus infection.",PMC3096629,PMC3096629_4
