"Deforestation and land use change are major drivers of emerging infectious disease events in east and southeast Asia. Between 2000 and 2030, pork consumption in China is expected to increase by 55%, leading to a potential increase in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and streptococcus suis infections, as well as the detection of Reston ebola virus infection in pigs in the Philippines. The intensification of livestock farming often results in more effective separation of domestic and wild animals, improved veterinary supervision and input, reduced movement of animals, and reduced species mixing, all of which may reduce the likelihood of disease emergence. However, higher genetic diversity within a host species is often associated with differences in susceptibility to infection, thereby limiting the potential for infections to spread rapidly, making it clear that higher genetic variation within a host species is often associated with differences in susceptibility to infection, thereby limiting the potential for infections to spread rapidly, making it clear that higher genetic variation within a host species is often associated with differences in susceptibility to infection, thereby limiting the potential for infections to spread rapidly, making it clear that higher genetic variation within a host species is often associated with differences in susceptibility to infection, thereby limiting the potential for infections to spread rapidly, making it clear that higher genetic variation within a host species is often associated with differences in susceptibility to infection, thereby limiting the potential for infections to spread rapidly, making it clear that higher genetic variation within a host species is often associated with differences in susceptibility to infection, thereby limiting the potential for infections to spread rapidly, making it clear that higher genetic variation within a host species is often associated with differences in susceptibility to infection, thereby limiting the potential for infections to spread rapidly, making it clear that higher genetic variation within a host species is often associated with differences in susceptibility to infection, thereby limiting the potential for infections to spread rapidly, making it clear that higher genetic variation within a host species is often associated with differences in susceptibility to infection, thereby limiting the potential for infections to spread rapidly, making it clear that higher genetic variation within a host species is often associated with differences in susceptibility to infection, thereby limiting the potential for infections to spread rapidly, making it clear that higher genetic variation within a host species is often associated with differences in susceptibility to infection, thereby limiting the potential for infections to spread rapidly,",PMC3713834,PMC3713834_0
