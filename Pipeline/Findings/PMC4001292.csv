"A nested case-control study conducted in rural Peru found that laboratory-confirmed influenza and parainfluenza virus (PIV) infections significantly increase the risk of acquiring a new serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a major cause of pneumonia.",PMC4001292,PMC4001292_0
The study also found that this association was particularly strong among children who were already colonized with pneumococcus.,PMC4001292,PMC4001292_1
"The study's findings suggest a selective synergism between certain respiratory viruses, including influenza and PIV, and pneumococcus.",PMC4001292,PMC4001292_2
"The study's authors suggest that these observations are pivotal to developing strategies for disease prevention, as pneumococcal acquisition increases the risk of pneumococcal diseases.",PMC4001292,PMC4001292_3
The study's authors note that additional research is warranted to clarify the specific mechanisms of pneumococcal interaction with influenza and PIV.,PMC4001292,PMC4001292_4
