"The study demonstrates that ex in chf activates the ace2 and ang-(1–7) axis of the brain ras, potentially leading to a decrease in ang II and an increase in ang-(1–7) after ex.",PMC2853198,PMC2853198_0
"The study suggests that ex reduces hr in sham + ex and chf + ex rabbits, but does not affect other cardiac parameters, indicating that the benefits of ex in chf may be due to a peripheral vasodilatory effect.",PMC2853198,PMC2853198_1
"The study finds that the normalization of the balance between ace and ace2 in the brain after ex is a global effect observed in many brain nuclei, suggesting that this normalization is not a specific effect observed in specific brain nuclei.",PMC2853198,PMC2853198_2
"The study localizes ace in vascular endothelial cells in the rvlm, colocalizing with the endothelial marker cd31, while ace2 is colocalized with neurons staining positive for the neuronal marker neun.",PMC2853198,PMC2853198_3
"The study suggests that the imbalance between ace and ace2 in chf and its normalization after ex may be a global effect observed in many brain nuclei and regions, potentially due to the p38 mapk and erk1/2 signaling pathway being involved in ace upregulation and ace2 downregulation, as suggested by a previous study.",PMC2853198,PMC2853198_4
