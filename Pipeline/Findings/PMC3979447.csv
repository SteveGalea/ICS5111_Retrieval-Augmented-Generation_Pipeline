"The study compared the biologic activity of three interferon beta (IFNB) formulations, including IFNB-1a subcutaneous (SC) and IFNB-1a SC nonfate (NF) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).",PMC3979447,PMC3979447_0
"On a weight basis, both IFNB-1a SC and IFNB-1a SC NF formulations induced similar levels of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, and both induced significantly higher mRNA levels of ISG compared with IFNB-1b SC.",PMC3979447,PMC3979447_1
"When concentrations corresponding to 10 times the interferon (IFN) unit (IU) were compared on a weight basis, a smaller reduction in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) yield was observed with IFNB-1b SC compared with either IFNB-1a SC formulation.",PMC3979447,PMC3979447_2
"However, when concentrations corresponding to 100 times the IFN unit were compared on a weight basis, vSV yield reductions were similar with each of the three IFNB formulations, possibly because at this concentration, the plateau phase of the doseâ€“response curve has been reached, and so differences in IFNB activity between IFNB formulations are no longer observed.",PMC3979447,PMC3979447_3
"The study emphasizes the potential importance of determining the relative biologic activity of different IFNB formulations and suggests that a greater amount of IFNB-1b SC may be needed to achieve the same biologic response as IFNB-1a SC formulations, despite the fact that IFNB-1b SC has a molecular weight that is approximately 82% of that of IFNB-1a SC.",PMC3979447,PMC3979447_4
