"The newly developed lamp detection method for pcv2 is more sensitive than conventional pcr, with a detection limit of 10 copies for pcv2 dna compared to the previously reported limit of 100 copies for pcv2 dna using conventional pcr.",PMC3315793,PMC3315793_0
"The lamp reaction temperature for pcv2 is 55-60째C, and the optimized temperature for the annealing step in conventional pcr is also 55-60째C.",PMC3315793,PMC3315793_1
"The lamp assay can be completed in 45 minutes, and the conventional pcr reaction can also be completed within 35 cycles, each for 30 seconds at 95째C, followed by a final elongation of 5 minutes at 72째C.",PMC3315793,PMC3315793_2
"The newly added loop primers (lf and lb) significantly accelerate the lamp reaction, making it more rapid and efficient than conventional pcr.",PMC3315793,PMC3315793_3
"The lamp assay can be carried out directly on clinical samples without the need for dna extraction, making it a more convenient and cost-effective method for diagnosis.",PMC3315793,PMC3315793_4
