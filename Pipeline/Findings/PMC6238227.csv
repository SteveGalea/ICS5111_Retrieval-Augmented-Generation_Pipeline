The study identifies src kinase as the most resistant kinase in tnbc cells in response to chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin.,PMC6238227,PMC6238227_0
"Ablation of src reduces phosphorylation of downstream effectors akt and stat3 in tnbc cells, which are highly activated in these cells.",PMC6238227,PMC6238227_1
"High co-expression of src and stat3 is associated with poor prognosis in patients with tnbc, suggesting src-stat3 signaling may be involved in chemoresistance in tnbc cells.",PMC6238227,PMC6238227_2
"The study shows that tnbc cells with tp53 mutations, which are present in the majority of patients with tnbc, have differential chemoresistance mechanisms compared to those without mutations.",PMC6238227,PMC6238227_3
The study suggests that the src-stat3 axis may play an important role in the chemoresistance of tnbc cells and could be used to evaluate whether tumors can be treated with src inhibitors during chemotherapy.,PMC6238227,PMC6238227_4
