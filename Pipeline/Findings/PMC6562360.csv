"A study by Belnap et al. (2019) identified a broadly neutralizing antibody against dengue virus serotype 1, which was found to have potent in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against all four dengue virus serotypes. The antibody, DENV-1-4-1-2-3, was shown to block viral entry into cells by binding to the conserved region II of the envelope glycoprotein, which is present on all four serotypes.",PMC6562360,PMC6562360_0
"A study by Appanna et al. (2019) utilized a single-cell droplet microfluidic approach to generate a complete antibody repertoire against dengue virus. The authors were able to isolate broadly neutralizing antibodies against dengue virus, ebola, and influenza using this approach, which involved physically linking heavy and light mRNAs and performing overlap extension PCR to generate a continuous heavy-light chain amplicon for cloning into a yeast display system for Fab or IgG, allowing for screening for antigen specificity and affinity by FACS.",PMC6562360,PMC6562360_1
A study by Wong et al. (2018) utilized a single-cell RT-PCR approach to generate dengue virus envelope-specific antibodies. The authors were able to identify envelope-specific B cells and characterize the antibody repertoire during the acute phase of dengue virus infection.,PMC6562360,PMC6562360_2

"A study by Appanna et al. (2017) utilized a single-cell RT-PCR approach to generate dengue virus envelope-specific antibodies. The authors found that the majority of antibodies generated in this study recognized the conserved region II of the envelope glycoprotein, which is present on all four dengue virus serotypes.",PMC6562360,PMC6562360_4
