"A study in a low-felv prevalence region in the UK found that while 27% of clinically healthy cats were positive for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigenemia, only 4% tested positive for FeLV provirus DNA. This suggests that a portion of FeLV-exposed cats, previously believed to be progressively infected, may actually be regressively infected, with the potential for future viral reactivation.",PMC5871024,PMC5871024_0
"The study also found that while rapid FeLV antigen immunoassays can serve as an initial screening test, they cannot identify cats with regressive infection, and a portion of FeLV-antigen positive cats are actually regressively infected. Therefore, screening with a rapid FeLV antigen immunoassay alone carries the risk of false-positive results, and any positive antigen results from stand-alone rapid FeLV antigen immunoassays could be followed up with a rapid FeLV antigen immunoassay and a FeLV proviral DNA test, as suggested above.",PMC5871024,PMC5871024_1
"The study demonstrated that both FeLV proviral DNA and antigen tests can be carried out simultaneously using a single reagent set, the FeLV reverse transcription-insulated isothermal PCR (rt-iipcr) reagent set, which allows for the detection of both viral RNA and proviral DNA template. This reagent set can potentially work with a rapid FeLV antigen immunoassay as a suitable patient-side tool to aid FeLV infection confirmation and diagnosis.",PMC5871024,PMC5871024_2
