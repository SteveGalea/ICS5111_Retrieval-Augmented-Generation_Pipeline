"The study developed an automated fluorescent capillary electrophoresis and geneScan software analysis assay for detecting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), and influenza viruses in clinical specimens, particularly in young children, who have low-titer viruses in respiratory secretions.",PMC193844,PMC193844_0
"The study found that the genescan RT-PCR assay offered a highly sensitive and specific method for detecting common respiratory viruses, including HRSV, HPIVs, and influenza viruses, with an increased frequency of detection compared to virus isolation and antigen detection in previous studies.",PMC193844,PMC193844_1
"The study demonstrated that the genescan RT-PCR assay could detect mixed virus infections that could be missed by virus isolation, as illustrated by the detection of a dual-virus infection (HRSV and HPIV3) in one patient who was culture positive for only one virus (HRSV) and dual infections in two patients (HRSV and HPIV1 and influenza A virus) who were culture negative for both.",PMC193844,PMC193844_2
"The study found that the genescan RT-PCR assay could improve infection rate and disease burden estimates for common respiratory viruses in high-risk populations, such as young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, and expansion of the assay panel to include additional viral pathogens is in progress.",PMC193844,PMC193844_3
"The study highlighted the importance of using nasal and throat swabs, rather than nasopharyngeal aspirates or washes, among specimens collected in this study, as swab specimens yield less virus, often below the threshold for detection by virus isolation, but still above the threshold for detection by RT-PCR.",PMC193844,PMC193844_4
