HCoV-EMC/2012 is genetically related to other bat coronaviruses and may have originated from bats.,PMC3629412,PMC3629412_0
"In vitro studies have demonstrated that HCoV-EMC/2012 is sensitive to interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin, with both drugs alone having an antiviral effect against the virus.",PMC3629412,PMC3629412_1
"The concentrations required to achieve an antiviral effect against HCoV-EMC/2012 are likely achievable in humans, as interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin concentrations of 100-750 international units per milliliter and 24 micrograms per milliliter, respectively, have been observed in humans after intravenous injection.",PMC3629412,PMC3629412_2
"In Vero cells, the combination of interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin at lower concentrations resulted in an additive antiviral effect against HCoV-EMC/2012.",PMC3629412,PMC3629412_3
"The combination of interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin at lower concentrations also resulted in an additive antiviral effect against HCoV-EMC/2012 in LLC-MK2 cells, which are more sensitive to ribavirin than Vero cells.",PMC3629412,PMC3629412_4
