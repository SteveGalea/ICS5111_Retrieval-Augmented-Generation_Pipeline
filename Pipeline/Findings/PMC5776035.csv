"Multistate models, which allow estimation of survival, recapture, and transition rates between infectious and non-infectious states, were used to analyze coronavirus data in bats. This method provided estimates for these parameters and allowed for the grouping of bats into persistently infectious bats and transiently infectious bats.",PMC5776035,PMC5776035_0
"The cmr study in Smith's work [21] had relatively high recapture rates due to the finding of a lifting hole of a bridge where bats, infected with coronavirus, roosted with a high affinity to their colony. However, fluctuating recapture rates across capturing occasions in the cmr data highlighted the difficulty of recapturing specific bats during the entire sampling period, which might be associated with trap-shy and adaptive methods of capturing.",PMC5776035,PMC5776035_1
The results of model selection processes indicated that population-level viral persistence was marginally more probable when infectious periods were heterogeneous (bats were either transiently or persistently infectious) and explored various scenarios in epidemic models.,PMC5776035,PMC5776035_2
"The study provided much validity by using larger numbers of bats sampled [21], although the sample size is still not large enough to provide robust estimates.",PMC5776035,PMC5776035_3
"Fluctuating recapture rates across capturing occasions in the cmr data, which might be associated with trap-shy and adaptive methods of capturing, highlighted the difficulty of recapturing specific bats during the entire sampling period. This finding underscores the need for individual bat tracking data with infection states to improve our understanding of infection dynamics of bat-borne viruses.",PMC5776035,PMC5776035_4
