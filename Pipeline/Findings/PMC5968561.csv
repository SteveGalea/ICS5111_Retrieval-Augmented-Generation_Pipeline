"The authors present a strategy to construct mimetics of the HIV-1 gp41 nhr trimeric coiled coils, which are homologous with naturally occurring protein sequences and have extraordinary thermostability.",PMC5968561,PMC5968561_0
"These nhr trimeric coiled coils have promising inhibition against a broad spectrum of laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 isolates, including those resistant to clinically used T20.",PMC5968561,PMC5968561_1
"The authors demonstrate that these nhr trimeric coiled coils homologous with naturally occurring protein sequences have extraordinary thermostability, which contributes positively to their promising inhibition of HIV-1 fusion against a broad spectrum of laboratory-adapted and primary isolates, including those resistant to clinically used T20.",PMC5968561,PMC5968561_2
The authors show that these nhr trimeric coiled coils are less sensitive to proteolysis compared to the unstructured peptide T20 due to their tertiary structural integrity.,PMC5968561,PMC5968561_3
The authors suggest that this approach could be extendable to the isolation of certain α-helical trimers for basic scientific and therapeutic applications based on the ubiquitous helical protein–protein interactions found in nature.,PMC5968561,PMC5968561_4
