"Dna vaccination encoding cell membrane-targeting viral antigens led to the preferential production of igg-secreting hybridomas over igm-secreting hybridomas, as reported in a previous study. This suggests that proteins, as a vaccine type, may play a critical role in boosting the production of igg-secreting hybridomas in the dna vaccine platform.",PMC6082671,PMC6082671_0
"In the current study, vaccination with dna vaccines encoding cell membrane-associated viral antigens resulted in the successful generation of 12 polyclonal hybridomas secreting gp-specific igg types. Among these, five were successfully sub-cloned to igg-producing single clones, and all of the five purified monoclonal igg antibodies recognized gp in an antigen-specific and igg dose-dependent manner, with three recognizing the native forms of gp expressed on the cell surface and remaining reactive to gp at the lowest tested concentrations ranging from 1.953 to 7.8 ng/ml.",PMC6082671,PMC6082671_1
"The five purified igg antibodies possess ebola virus gp-binding activity, but none of these antibodies can neutralize ebola virus, suggesting that none of these purified antibodies can block ebola virus infection.",PMC6082671,PMC6082671_2
"In the current study, it was observed that immune sera from animals immunized with gp dna vaccines were unable to recognize the denatured forms of gp by western blot assay. This is in line with the observation that the remaining five polyclonal hybridomas (e2, e8, e22, e31, and e60) appear to lose their ability to produce igg antibodies after continuous cell culture and passage, leading to a failure in making an igg producer.",PMC6082671,PMC6082671_3
"In the current study, it was found that the five purified gp-specific igg antibodies possess ebola virus gp-binding activity but not ebola virus neutralizing activity. Among these, three recognized the native forms of gp expressed on the cell surface and remained reactive to gp at the lowest tested concentrations ranging from 1.953 to 7.8 ng/ml. However, these antibodies were unable to neutralize ebola",PMC6082671,PMC6082671_4
