"In a study investigating the use of phage display and panning method to identify antigens, a 96-well maxisorp plate was coated with 100 µg/ml of various antigens in PBS buffer at 4°C overnight. After washing with blocking buffer (2% BSA in PBS) at room temperature for 1 hour, 30 µl of pre-blocked phage supernatant (typically containing 1010-1011 cfu) was added to each well for 1 hour at room temperature to allow binding. After four rounds of panning, single colonies were picked and identified by using HRP conjugated mouse anti-M13 antibody (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburg, PA) for soluble protein production and purification.",PMC6312525,PMC6312525_0
"In the production and purification of a single-domain soluble protein, the pCOM3x phagemids containing the vnar binders were transformed into HB2151 E. Coli cells. The formed colonies were pooled for culture in 2 L of 2TY media containing 2% glucose, 100 µg/ml ampicillin at 37°C until the OD600 reaches 0.8-1.0. The culture media was then replaced with 2TY media containing 1 mM IPTG (Sigma), 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and shaken at 30°C overnight for soluble protein production. The bacterial pellet was spun down and lysed with polymyxin B (Sigma) for 1 hour at 37°C to release the soluble protein, and the supernatant was harvested after lysis and purified using a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) using AKTA.",PMC6312525,PMC6312525_1
"In a study investigating the binding kinetics of a single-domain soluble protein, PE38-B6-His was buffer exchanged in PBS buffer after purification. The binding kinetics of PE38-B6-His was measured with FORTEBIO Octet RED96 located at the Biophysics Core in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. PE38",PMC6312525,PMC6312525_2
