The study aimed to investigate the duration of immunity following a single-dose vaccination against Andes virus (andv) in Syrian hamsters using a vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv)-based vaccine vector expressing the andv glycoprotein complex (gpc).,PMC3939469,PMC3939469_0
The study found that the vsvâˆ†g-andv-gpc vaccine provided significant protection against andv-induced disease in hamsters 6 months after vaccination but not 12 months post-vaccination.,PMC3939469,PMC3939469_1
"The study observed a decrease in neutralizing antibody titers in hamsters 6 and 12 months post-vaccination, which could explain the loss of protection over time.",PMC3939469,PMC3939469_2
"The study found that most hamsters that survived andv challenge at 6 and 12 months post-vaccination developed anti-andv-n antibodies, indicating that sterile immunity was not achieved.",PMC3939469,PMC3939469_3
The study suggests that differences in the vaccine platform and animal species used might account for differences in the immune response to this vaccine in hamsters.,PMC3939469,PMC3939469_4
The study highlights the need for further evaluation of the vaccine's durability of protection and the role of age in survival.,PMC3939469,PMC3939469_5
The study used a different route of inoculation (i.n.) to mimic human exposure or transmission compared to the previous study (i.p.).,PMC3939469,PMC3939469_6
"The study suggests that mucosal immunity might be more difficult to achieve and confer sterile immunity, as opposed to the intraperitoneal route used previously.",PMC3939469,PMC3939469_7
The study recommends repeating this study with larger group sizes to resolve differences in the potential survival of aged control animals and discriminating this from the durability of the vaccine.,PMC3939469,PMC3939469_8
"The study recommends addressing the observed increase in survival of the non-vaccinated control animals in the 12-month group, where two survived at this time point, and only one survived at 6 months, experimentally.",PMC3939469,PMC3939469_9
The study recommends using different routes of inoculation to compare the study's findings with our previous study.,PMC3939469,PMC3939469_10
The study recommends examining the role of mucosal immunity in achieving sterile immunity in further studies.,PMC3939469,PMC3939469_11
