"In the study of societal learning and relaxation during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore, one key finding is that the maximum likelihood estimate of the relaxation parameter in the learning rate model is extraordinarily close to one, indicating little evidence for relaxation in the learning rate for SARS in Singapore. Another finding is that the mean removal rate probably does relax, but the data available to this study are too aggregated to make this inference conclusively.",PMC1762333,PMC1762333_0
"In the analysis of the effect of learning on transmission, a key finding is that the final size of an outbreak decreases rapidly with a modest investment in learning, and that the basic learning rate is 0.0066 dâ€“1, with a 95% confidence interval of [0.0051, 0.0081].",PMC1762333,PMC1762333_1
"In the discussion of the analysis with all data, one finding is that the distribution of average infectious period at the point where the outbreak was rapidly brought under control was highly dispersed, with a high variance and skewness. Another finding is that the societal and economic costs of mistakenly declaring a state of emergency can be tremendous, but the costs of failing to intervene in a major preventable outbreak are probably small in comparison.",PMC1762333,PMC1762333_2
"In the study of learning and societal learning during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore, a key finding is that one relatively uncertain data point was important to this analysis, but its importance, especially at the end of the data series, is not the first model to consider where such data are available, and it must instead be inferred from the information provided by the epidemic curve together with observations of the onset-of-symptoms to removal interval.",PMC1762333,PMC1762333_3
"In the study of the effect of learning on transmission, a finding is that the processes considered to contribute to learning include identifying the different activities that contribute to learning (a 0) and their costs, and that learning rates (and possibly relaxation) will vary geographically reflecting different societal conditions, research institutions, levels of emergency preparedness, etc. Further, these phenomena may also differ depending on their similarity to diseases that are well understood or their resistance to laboratory isolation and characterization.",PMC1762333,PMC1762333_4
