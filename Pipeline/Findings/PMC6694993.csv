The synthesized complexes of 3-aryl-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues showed enhanced antimicrobial activity against most of the pathogenic strains relative to their ligands.,PMC6694993,PMC6694993_0
"The metal complexes of the 3-aryl-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues exhibited a significant decrease in the polarity of the metal ion due to coordination of co++ and ni++ ions to the respective ligands, which facilitates the penetration of the novel synthesized complexes into the lipoid cell membrane of microorganisms and inhibits their growth.",PMC6694993,PMC6694993_1
"The antimicrobial activities of the novel synthesized complexes were investigated against a few bacterial and fungal strains, but it is necessary to investigate the antimicrobial activities of the complexes against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.",PMC6694993,PMC6694993_2
"The metal complexes from 3-aryl-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues were synthesized, and their spectral characterization confirmed their structural environment.",PMC6694993,PMC6694993_3
"Compounds 4a and 4e showed considerably enhanced antimicrobial activity against most of the pathogenic strains relative to their ligands, and complexes 4a and 4e are recommended as a new chemical class of antimicrobial agents.",PMC6694993,PMC6694993_4
