"In the context of a search for the term 'angiotensin converting enzyme' in the NCBI protein database, it was found that over 400 protein sequences match this term. By filtering the search results using the 'related structures' filter, over 240 of these sequences were found to have links to related structures. One example is the ACE protein from Rattus norvegicus (accession number 'np_036676'). When the 'related structures' option is selected from the 'Links' menu for this protein sequence, a request is made to the NCBI 'related structure' service, which returns a summary page indicating which regions of the sequence are annotated by each related structure. This page also allows sorting of the alignments by various parameters, such as score or length, and selection of non-redundant subsets.",PMC1751549,PMC1751549_0
"When the 'related structure' service is used to examine the sequence-structure alignment of the query protein sequence with the human ACE enzyme in complex with lisinopril, it was found that this sequence is highly similar in sequence to the human ACE enzyme, with an identity of over 82% in the aligned region. The core of the structure is primarily formed by residues that are conserved between the two aligned rows, while non-conserved residues are mainly located on the structure's surface.",PMC1751549,PMC1751549_1
"When the sequence-structure alignment of the query protein sequence with the human ACE enzyme in complex with lisinopril is compared to the complexes of the same protein with different drugs/inhibitors (structures with PDB codes 1O86, 1UZF, and 1UZE), it was found that several related structures contain complexes of the same protein with different drugs/inhibitors, such as enalaprilat and captopril. This allows for the identification of conserved interactions between the ACE enzyme and these drugs/inhibitors, which are similar in chemical structure to lisinopril.",PMC1751549,PMC1751549_2
When the sequence-structure alignment of the query protein sequence with the human ACE enzyme in complex with lisinopril is compared to the complex between the receptor binding domain from SARS coronavirus spike and human versus rat angiotensin-converting enzym,PMC1751549,PMC1751549_3
