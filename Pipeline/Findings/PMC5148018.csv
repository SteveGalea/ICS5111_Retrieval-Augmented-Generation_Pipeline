"The longitudinal profiles of igg and igm antibodies against mers-cov in sera from a mers patient showed that seroconversion of antibodies against s, s1, and rbd occurred earlier than seroconversion of antibodies against the whole mers-cov virus particle.",PMC5148018,PMC5148018_0
"The s, s1, and rbd elisas were more sensitive than other elisa formats, especially the s1 and rbd elisas, as they are smaller than the full-length s and easier to express and purify.",PMC5148018,PMC5148018_1
"The ppnt assay, which does not require biosafety level 3 facilities, showed an excellent correlation with the s elisa, although the latter is a binding assay while the former is a functional neutralizing assay.",PMC5148018,PMC5148018_2
"The np-based elisa, which is an immunodominant antigen used to detect sars-cov infection, showed later seroconversion of np-specific antibodies compared to seroconversion of antibodies against several s proteins and inactivated mers-cov.",PMC5148018,PMC5148018_3
"The s, s1, ntd, and rbd elisas, as well as the ppnt assay, can be used for mers-cov diagnosis and seroepidemiology, with the s, s1, and rbd elisas being more sensitive than other elisa formats.",PMC5148018,PMC5148018_4
