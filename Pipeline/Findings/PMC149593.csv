"The ics-rv assay, a rapid immunomigration test for the detection of human group a rotavirus, was evaluated as a potential diagnostic tool for bovine rotavirus.",PMC149593,PMC149593_0
The sensitivity and specificity of the ics-rv assay were comparable to those of commercially available enzyme immunoassays and RT-PCR for detecting rotavirus in samples from calves with neonatal diarrhea.,PMC149593,PMC149593_1
"The ics-rv assay had a high positive predictive value and a relatively high negative predictive value, making it a useful tool for disease control recommendations to producers.",PMC149593,PMC149593_2
The ics-rv assay reliably detected rotavirus shedding during the clinical phase of the disease when orally inoculated colostrum-deprived calves with a reference strain of rotavirus.,PMC149593,PMC149593_3
"The ics-rv assay met the requirements for a field test, including being practical and user-friendly, as it was a 10-min one-step test with all necessary reagents included in the kit and no need for laboratory equipment.",PMC149593,PMC149593_4
