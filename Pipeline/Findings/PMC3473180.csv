The chloroplast expression vector pld-lh-ctb was constructed by designing primers to introduce an rbs site (ggagg) five bases upstream of the start codon of the native ctb gene and deleting the leader peptide sequence.,PMC3473180,PMC3473180_0
"The transformed and untransformed e. Coli cultures (24 and 48 hours) were centrifuged, the pellets were washed twice with 200 mm tris-hcl, resuspended in 500 μl of extraction buffer, and sonicated. The leaf extracts (100–120 μg as determined by Bradford protein assay) were ground in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in bicarbonate buffer.",PMC3473180,PMC3473180_1
"The chemiluminescent detection was performed using the S. Tag™ AP luminescence kit (Novagen) for the elisa quantification of ctb in leaves (transformed and untransformed plants, 100 mg).",PMC3473180,PMC3473180_2
"The transformed and untransformed plant total dna from putative transgenic and untransformed plants was isolated using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen). PCR primers, aaaacccgtcctcagttcggattgc (3p), ccgcgttgtttcatcaagccttacg (3m), ctgtagaagtcaccattgttgtgc (5p), and Tgactgcccacctgagagcggaca (2m), were used to perform PCR on both putative transgenic and untransformed plant total dna.",PMC3473180,PMC3473180_3
"(Optional) The following finding is also important: The pld-lh-ctb vector dna digested with BglII and BamHI generated a 0.8 kb probe homologous to the flanking sequences, and hybridization was performed using the Ready to Go protocol (Pharmacia) for the Southern blot analysis of total plant dna from putative transgenic and untransformed plants. The transformed T1 seedlings were grown in bottles containing MSO with spectinomycin (500 mg/l) for two weeks, and plants were transferred to pots. PCR confirmed shoots, from the second culture cycle, were transferred to rooting",PMC3473180,PMC3473180_4
