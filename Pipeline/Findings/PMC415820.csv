"MHV infection results in the inhibition of dna synthesis and cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase, leading to the accumulation of cells in these phases.",PMC415820,PMC415820_0
"MHV infection reduces the amounts of G1 cyclins, resulting in decreased CDK4/6 and CDK2 activities, which blocks cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase.",PMC415820,PMC415820_1
MHV infection induces a reduction in the amounts of G1 cyclins through both transcriptional and translational mechanisms.,PMC415820,PMC415820_2
MHV-induced cell cycle arrest potentially has additional important biological significance for virus-induced pathogenicity as noncycling cells are less likely to be killed efficiently by cytotoxic T cells.,PMC415820,PMC415820_3
"MHV-induced cell cycle arrest potentially assists in efficient MHV assembly by providing increased amounts of ribonucleotide pools for efficient MHV RNA synthesis, as ribonucleotides are the precursors for synthesizing deoxyribonucleotides, and a reduction in cellular DNA synthesis most likely increases the levels of ribonucleotide pools in cells.",PMC415820,PMC415820_4
