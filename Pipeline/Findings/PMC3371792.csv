SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was detected in fecal and urine samples from SARS patients using capture ELISAs and real-time qRT-PCR.,PMC3371792,PMC3371792_0
"The sensitivity of ELISAs was lower than that of real-time qRT-PCR, especially in urine samples.",PMC3371792,PMC3371792_1
"The QRT-PCR method is the preferred method for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection due to its higher sensitivity, especially in fecal samples.",PMC3371792,PMC3371792_2
"The QRT-PCR method can detect SARS-CoV in fecal and urine samples obtained during the late phase of illness, suggesting prolonged shedding of nonviable viruses or the presence of neutralizing antibodies.",PMC3371792,PMC3371792_3
"The ELISA results correlated with SARS-CoV RNA concentration in fecal and urine samples, with higher detection rates in samples with higher viral loads.",PMC3371792,PMC3371792_4
