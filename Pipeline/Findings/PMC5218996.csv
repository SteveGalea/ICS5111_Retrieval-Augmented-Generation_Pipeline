The 5' end of RNA plays a crucial role in the recognition of viral and self RNA by the host immune system.,PMC5218996,PMC5218996_0
"The 5' triphosphate (5' ppp) and cap-1 structures at the 5' end of RNA are important for recognition by RIG-I and MDA-5, while the 5' monophosphate (5' mpp) and cap-0 structures are recognized by IFIT proteins.",PMC5218996,PMC5218996_1
Viruses have developed mechanisms to antagonize RNA cap recognition by modifying the 5' cap structure or by using a highly stable RNA secondary structure to evade detection by IFIT proteins.,PMC5218996,PMC5218996_2
The 5' cap structure of RNA promotes self vs non-self-discrimination in addition to facilitating protein translation by providing increased stability and protection from 5' exonucleases.,PMC5218996,PMC5218996_3
"The absence of the 2'-O methylation in the cap structure is compensated in some viruses to avoid detection by IFIT proteins, which is the most predominant mechanism used by viruses to evade ssrNA recognition by IFIT proteins.",PMC5218996,PMC5218996_4
