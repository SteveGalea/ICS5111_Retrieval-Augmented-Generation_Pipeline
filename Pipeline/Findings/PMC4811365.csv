"One approach to attenuating viral vaccines is silent codon modification, which involves introducing synonymous codon substitutions to reduce viral replication rates and thus attenuate viral pathogenicity. This approach has been shown to lead to slow viral replication and reduced virulence in various viruses, such as the influenza virus (Mahony et al., 2009), the human norovirus (Kobiezko et al., 2011), and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Chen et al., 2014).",PMC4811365,PMC4811365_0
"Another approach is genome rearrangement or deletion, which involves removing non-essential viral genes or rearranging viral genomes to attenuate viral pathogenicity. This approach has been shown to lead to reduced virulence in the RSV (Liu et al., 2013) and human rhinovirus (HRV) (Chen et al., 2014) viruses.",PMC4811365,PMC4811365_1
"A third approach is the use of chimeric viruses, which involves introducing genes from closely or distantly related viruses to change viral tropism and attenuate viral pathogenicity. This approach has been shown to lead to stable attenuation in the case of the RSV virus (Chen et al., 2014).",PMC4811365,PMC4811365_2
"The use of viral ligase gene deletions has been shown to lead to reduced virulence in the RSV virus (Liu et al., 2013).",PMC4811365,PMC4811365_3
"However, evolutionary recovery is a major challenge to viral vaccine attenuation, as viruses can evolve to reverse attenuating mutations. In the case of silent codon modification, for example, the influenza virus has been shown to recover virulence through compensatory mutations (Kobiezko et al., 2011).",PMC4811365,PMC4811365_4
