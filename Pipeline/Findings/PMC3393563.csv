"A new virus belonging to the porcine enteroviruses (PEVs) was discovered through water specimen analysis, with a complete genome of 7,390 nucleotides identified using 10 sets of primers.",PMC3393563,PMC3393563_0
"The virus, isolated from a swine fecal specimen in China, shares 82.4% sequence homology with PEV9 strains and 77.5% sequence identity with PEV10 strains.",PMC3393563,PMC3393563_1
"Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the virus belongs to the species of PEV9 based on the P1 gene region, but a new serotype/genotype is proposed based on the 3CD gene region.",PMC3393563,PMC3393563_2
"Recombination may exist between different PEVs, as evidenced by a mosaic-like structure in the 5' UTR of the LP54 strain.",PMC3393563,PMC3393563_3
"The virus was identified in 8.3% (37/447) of pigs in central and eastern China from 2007 to 2009, causing neurological disorders, fertility disorders, and dermal lesions in swine.",PMC3393563,PMC3393563_4
