A rbd fragment containing residues 377-588 of mers-cov s protein is a critical neutralizing domain (cnd) capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov infection.,PMC5167628,PMC5167628_0
"Fusing the mers-cov rbd fragment with a trimerization motif, fd, forms a trimeric structure that binds strongly to mers-cov rbd-specific, conformational epitope-targeting mAbs, as well as mers-cov's receptor dpp4.",PMC5167628,PMC5167628_1
"Rbd-fd protein, formed by fusing the mers-cov rbd fragment with fd, is able to elicit highly efficacious IgG antibodies, along with Th2-based IgG1 and Th1-based IgG2 antibody responses.",PMC5167628,PMC5167628_2
"Rbd-fd protein, formed by fusing the mers-cov rbd fragment with fd, is able to induce long-term and highly potent neutralizing antibodies against infections of live and pseudotyped mers-cov of divergent strains isolated in the 2012-2015 outbreaks.",PMC5167628,PMC5167628_3
"The protective efficacy of rbd-fd protein is largely associated with neutralizing antibodies, as all of the mice survived from mers-cov infection had relatively high serum neutralizing antibody titers, suggesting that neutralizing antibodies, rather than cellular immune responses, may play a key role to prevent mers-cov infection in trimeric rbd-based subunit vaccines.",PMC5167628,PMC5167628_4
