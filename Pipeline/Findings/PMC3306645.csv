"The study found that wearing facemasks provides a significant reduction in exposure to airborne particles under both steady and transient events. The level of protection (pd) ranged from 33% to 100% for different parameters such as emission velocity, emission duration, and separation distance between the source and susceptible manikins. The study also observed that fully sealed facemasks provide the highest protection, while the least protective was the normal wearing scenario.",PMC3306645,PMC3306645_0
"The study found that the reduction of exposure decreases with increasing emission velocity and emission duration, and with decreasing separation distance between the source and susceptible manikins. The study also observed that the current results have important implications for public health professionals, occupational hygienists, and industrial hygienists to evaluate personal exposure, as particles used in the study were spherical, but the shapes of viruses and bacteria are cylindrical or of some irregular morphologies.",PMC3306645,PMC3306645_1
"The study found that the experiments were only conducted under one ventilation scheme, and that ventilation and airflow patterns naturally affect the airborne dispersion process. However, since this paper focuses on the effectiveness of facemasks, the experiments were only conducted under the one ventilation scheme (well-mixed ventilation). The study also observed that under pseudo-steady conditions, the pd is 45% for normal wearing scenarios.",PMC3306645,PMC3306645_2
"The study found that the particles used in the study were spherical, but the shapes of viruses and bacteria are cylindrical or of some irregular morphologies. In addition, the study observed that different professions can extend the present study to their applicable area, such as for fibrous-shaped pollutants. In addition, the relative humidity (rh) should also be considered for follow-up studies, as wearing facemasks will undoubtedly increase the rh between the face and the facemask.",PMC3306645,PMC3306645_3
"The study found that the current experimental results can help to estimate pandemic spreading under different protection scenarios, e.g., how facemasks are worn would affect the reduction of transmission. The study also observed that numerical models can improve the design and the performance of facemasks, such as modeling a completely sealed wearing scenario and comparing their results with the present study. Computational researchers can also validate their results with the present experimental results.",PMC3306645,PMC3306645_4
