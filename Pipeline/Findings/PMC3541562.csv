"Gene therapy using ribozymes, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) has shown promising results in targeting herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) genome and viral components, such as the reverse transcriptase, surface receptors, and replication proteins, for antiviral drug discovery. These approaches have demonstrated high specificity and efficiency in disrupting biological processes and preventing viral entry into cells.",PMC3541562,PMC3541562_0
"The delivery of genes encoding agents that are capable of disrupting numerous biological processes is a key concept in gene therapy. Targeting the reverse transcriptase can block the transcription process, and viral surface receptors represent attractive targets, as well as other strategies such as the inhibition of DNA polymerase, nuclear localisation signalling molecules, and protein-protein interactions.",PMC3541562,PMC3541562_1
"Gene therapy for new targets, such as the inhibition of HSV-1 replication by siRNAs against specific viral sequences, has shown promising results in animal models. The choice of the appropriate vector for targeting HSV-1 is essential for successful gene therapy, and the expression profile, bioavailability, biodegradability, and specificity of the vector are the main variables currently evaluated by several research groups.",PMC3541562,PMC3541562_2
"For chronic cases not requiring surgery, local application to the cornea is usually preferred, and the potential in the treatment of many genetic diseases and viral infections is progressively elevating the attention and awareness towards this new era of highly specialized treatment. Choices are made based on the ability of the targeted cells to uptake the vector, expression of the transgene in a cell-specific manner, and maintenance of expression for the period of time needed to tackle the disease. Pretreatment of corneas ex vivo in eye banks with specialized areas and trained staff is a new practical approach to corneal HSV-1 gene therapy that can help decrease transplants rejection due to chronic herpetic keratitis and minimize the risk of in vivo gene therapy.",PMC3541562,PMC3541562_3
