"The case report presents a dog with persistent cough and exercise intolerance, which is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), a small airway disease. BO can lead to chronic cough, wheeze, and dyspnea in humans and dogs, and can progress to pulmonary fibrosis.",PMC6795681,PMC6795681_0
"The dog's clinical signs persisted despite multiple courses of antimicrobials, suggesting a possible contribution from BO.",PMC6795681,PMC6795681_1
"Thoracic imaging and histopathology confirmed BO and widespread airway-centered interstitial fibrosis in the dog, suggesting that BO can progress to widespread airway-centered interstitial fibrosis in dogs.",PMC6795681,PMC6795681_2
"The dog's clinical signs and imaging findings are similar to those in children with BO, and supportive criteria for BO in humans include history of infectious pneumonia, airway obstruction, thoracic radiographic and CT compatible features, and exclusion of other chronic lung diseases.",PMC6795681,PMC6795681_3
The dog's clinical course suggests that BO should be a differential diagnosis for otherwise healthy young dogs developing cirdc pneumonia and respiratory signs persisting despite appropriate antimicrobials and with compatible thoracic imaging or histologic changes.,PMC6795681,PMC6795681_4
