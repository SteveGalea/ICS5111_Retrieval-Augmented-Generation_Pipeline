"TIA proteins are involved in multiple cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, epigenetic modifications, and translation control. In cancer development, loss or downregulation of TIA expression has been associated with a more severe phenotype, as it can activate genes involved in neoplastic and malignant transformation, evade the immune system, and enhance the growth and survival of cancer cells.",PMC4614917,PMC4614917_0
"TIA proteins act as cellular gatekeepers, as they contribute to cell-cycle arrest and cell death during tia1 or tiar expression. Loss or downregulation of TIA expression can play a role in cancer progression by activating genes involved in neoplastic and malignant transformation, evading the immune system, and enhancing the growth and survival of cancer cells.",PMC4614917,PMC4614917_1
"TIA proteins can be found in different biological situations or pathophysiological conditions, including genotoxic stresses, genomic instability, and cancer development. In cancer patients, mutated TIA expression can be used as a biomarker to identify individuals at high risk for metastasis, differentially diagnose early-late cancer, and assess the efficacy of therapy and chemopreventive agents.",PMC4614917,PMC4614917_2
"TIA proteins are involved in multiple molecular targets, including transcription, splicing, translation, and epigenetic modifications. They can be found in cells, tissues, and organisms, and their specific environmental settings can be identified.",PMC4614917,PMC4614917_3
"The regulatory message associated with TIA proteins is still unknown, but their secrets and potential constantly invite further investigation. Future research should elucidate the specific environmental settings under which TIA proteins act as cellular gatekeepers, as well as the fraction of TIA1 and/or tiar regulatory events and layers that contribute to phenotypic differences relevant for conserved or prevalent changes between cells, tissues, and/or species.",PMC4614917,PMC4614917_4
