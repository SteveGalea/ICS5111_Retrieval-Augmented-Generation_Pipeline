The study successfully expressed recombinant core and ns3 antigens encoded by different hcv gene fragments in bacteria and analyzed their immunoreactivity to anti-hcv antibodies.,PMC3573733,PMC3573733_0
The study found that the full-length core and ns3 (1183-1476 aa) proteins have the major immuno-dominant epitopes of the hcv genome.,PMC3573733,PMC3573733_1
"The study constructed a double antigen sandwich lateral-flow immunochromatographic anti-hcv immunoassay strip using the recombinant core and ns3 (1183-1476 aa) antigens, which allows for the more rapid and more economical detection of hcv with high sensitivity and specificity in testing for hcv.",PMC3573733,PMC3573733_2
The study found that the core protein and the new ns3 protein (1183-1476 aa) were suitable for analyzing the presence of antibodies against individual hcv proteins in human sera obtained from patients suffering from chronic hcv infection.,PMC3573733,PMC3573733_3
The study demonstrated that a new ns3 segment (1183-1476 aa) shows strong reactivity in 95.6% of rt-pcr-positive samples and can act as a potential tool for the diagnosis of hcv infection.,PMC3573733,PMC3573733_4
