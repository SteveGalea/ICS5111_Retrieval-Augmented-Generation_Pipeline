"A new dual agonist, comp#1, was designed based on the combination of three key cores from the existing dual agonist, gw409544. The new technique of ""core hopping"" allowed for the rapid screening of novel cores to overcome unwanted properties and generate new lead compounds with improved core properties.",PMC3369836,PMC3369836_0
"Comp#1 showed a more stable binding to both Pparα and Pparγ, with lower fluctuations in molecular dynamics simulations compared to the existing dual agonist, gw409544.",PMC3369836,PMC3369836_1
"The new dual agonist, comp#1, had a similar function in activating the AF2 helix region as the existing dual agonist, gw409544.",PMC3369836,PMC3369836_2
"The new dual agonist, comp#1, had pharmacologically relevant properties, such as partition coefficient, van der Waals surface area of polar nitrogen and oxygen atoms, aqueous solubility, and apparent mdck permeability, all within the acceptable range for human beings. These findings suggest that comp#1 and other top 10 derivatives found in this study have the potential to become drug candidates or to stimulate new strategy for developing novel dual agonists against type-2 diabetes.",PMC3369836,PMC3369836_3
"(Optional finding: The core a part, which was kept unchanged during the process of designing the newly compounds, may further improve the log s value of the new agonists according to the text.)",PMC3369836,PMC3369836_4
