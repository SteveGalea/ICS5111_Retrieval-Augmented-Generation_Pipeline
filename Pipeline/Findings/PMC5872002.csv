"In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, pupillometry has been shown to be a valuable tool for the early detection and monitoring of diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and glaucoma. This is because the pupillary light reflex (PLR) is a quantitative, non-invasive measure of autonomic nervous system function that is altered in these conditions. For example, in Parkinson's disease, the PLR is attenuated due to decreased sympathetic nervous system activity, while in Alzheimer's disease, it is reduced due to decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity. Additionally, in glaucoma, the PLR is attenuated due to optic nerve damage, and dynamic pupillometry has been used to monitor the progression of the disease and the response to treatment.",PMC5872002,PMC5872002_0
"In the context of drug and alcohol misuse, pupillometry has been shown to be a sensitive index of exposure and has been used to detect and monitor the effects of toxins and toxic chemicals such as organophosphates, botulinum toxin, and bacterial biothreat agents. For example, botulinum toxin, a nerve agent, causes miosis (constricted pupils) due to decreased cholinergic signaling, and pupillometry has been used to monitor the effects of the toxin in animal models. Similarly, exposure to organophosphates, a family of chemicals including nerve agents and pesticides, causes dose-dependent miosis and attenuation of the PLR, which is attributed to desensitization of muscarinic receptors within retinal tissue following prolonged exposure.",PMC5872002,PMC5872002_1
"In the context of infection and inflammation, pupillometry has been shown to offer the potential to detect systemic changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic system function in response to infection and inflammation. This is because the brain monitors and modulates immune status through both humoral and neural pathways, and changes to cholinergic signaling are likely to influence the PLR both directly and indirectly. For example, in response to infection, signals from the vagus afferent fibers eventually project to the locus coeruleus region of the brain, and measurement of the PLR using dynamic pupillometry may offer the potential to detect systemic changes in",PMC5872002,PMC5872002_2
