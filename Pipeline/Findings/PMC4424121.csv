"In a recent study, the authors proposed a 3-step process for henipavirus f activation, which involves a bidentate g-f interaction of the f protein head with the g protein upper stalk or head, which prevents f from interacting with the g stalk f-activating region prematurely (Li et al., 2013).",PMC4424121,PMC4424121_0
"In another study, the authors identified a stretch of amino acids at the membrane-distal portion of the niv g stalk that is important for g-f interactions, receptor-induced conformational changes, and f-triggering (Li et al., 2015).",PMC4424121,PMC4424121_1
"The authors also found that in addition to almost all the stalk domains of hn proteins, the mev h stalks also contain a structurally stabilized region in the c-terminal part that extends beyond that of hn stalks, and this region is important for fusion promotion (Bose et al., 2014).",PMC4424121,PMC4424121_2
"The authors suggested that the mev h globular head rearrangement and stalk exposure allow the f interaction to switch to a more productive association with the central part of the stalk, leading to f-triggering and membrane fusion (Bose et al., 2014).",PMC4424121,PMC4424121_3
"The authors also demonstrated that during cellular transport of the associated f-h glycoprotein complexes, f cleavage weakens the f-h interaction, following which f could now switch to a more productive interaction with the stalk (Brindley et al., 2012).",PMC4424121,PMC4424121_4
