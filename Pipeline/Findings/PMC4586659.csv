"The Chinese government has implemented a comprehensive web-based real-time disease surveillance system, covering 98% of counties and higher-level hospitals and 88% of township hospitals [20,21]. However, the system's capacity to detect and verify emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases and rapidly respond to future disease outbreaks still needs improvement [16,23,24].",PMC4586659,PMC4586659_0
"The health workforce in some rural areas of China is relatively less trained and motivated [7]. Few health professionals at provincial or lower levels CDCS have received formal epidemiological training, and communication with international counterparts would be limited [7].",PMC4586659,PMC4586659_1
"Underreporting of infectious diseases is not uncommon in some areas of China, although in recent years the situation has improved as regulations are now in place [28]. Effective communication and information sharing between local hospitals and CDCS are critical for addressing the threats to disease control and prevention, yet doctors do not always report diseases as required [24].",PMC4586659,PMC4586659_2
"Rapid urbanization has brought numerous benefits to China and substantially improved Chinese people’s standard of living on the whole; public health, however, has not progressed to the same extent. Rapid urbanization has caused dramatic changes in natural landscapes in China, and consequently influenced the transmission of infectious diseases [37]. Studies have found that urbanization can impact on vector/rodent-borne infections, as many highly adaptable species in urban areas are important reservoir hosts for vector-borne and rodent-borne pathogens [39,40].",PMC4586659,PMC4586659_3
"Like rapid urbanization, increasing climate change is of great concern to the Chinese government and people [42,43]. Many infectious disease agents, such as viruses and bacteria, and vectors, such as mosquitoes and rodents, are influenced by seasonality and changes in temperature, rainfall and humidity [44]. Studies have found that the average global land and ocean surface temperature from 1880 to 2012 has risen by 0.85 ± 0.2 °C [45]. The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC Fifth Assessment Report) has predicted an increase of 1.1–6.4 °C in the average global land and ocean surface temperature from 1990",PMC4586659,PMC4586659_4
