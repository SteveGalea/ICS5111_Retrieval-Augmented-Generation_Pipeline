"In a study of the local hiv transmission network in San Diego, California, it was observed that individuals with high transmission network scores (tns > 0.75) had a significantly greater predicted risk of hiv transmission within their first year of infection than those with lower tns scores. This finding suggests that tns reflects a biologic correlate of transmission risk.",PMC4047027,PMC4047027_0
"The study also found that self-selected early initiation of antiretroviral (ART) drug resistance was associated with a cumulative decrease in putative hiv transmission in the network, as compared to delaying ART.",PMC4047027,PMC4047027_1
"The study used data from the local hiv transmission network to inform simulations, which demonstrated that targeting individuals with the greatest number of recent sexual partners or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with highly effective prevention intervention strategies, like fully suppressive ART, would reduce local hiv transmission more efficiently than with the same prevention intervention targeting individuals with lower numbers of recent sexual partners or STIs.",PMC4047027,PMC4047027_2
"The study also found that network connections at baseline predicted future hiv transmission risk, and prevention efforts targeted to these individuals may be a better use of prevention resources than random implementation or targeting individuals with lower numbers of recent sexual partners or STIs.",PMC4047027,PMC4047027_3
"The study noted that while the efficiency of hiv transmission per contact may vary by geographic region, more sophisticated methods are being developed to help better associate molecular and epidemiological links, and these results may not be generalizable to other networks. However, with appropriate privacy protection protocols, it is reasonable to consider using hiv transmission network data to develop prevention intervention strategies. The study also highlighted the potential loss of privacy related to disclosure of putative hiv transmission links and noted the limitations in proving direct hiv transmission links. Nevertheless, it suggested that awareness of hiv transmission network characteristics could help local public health officials and clinicians to focus hiv-1 screening and prevention education messages for particular groups over time.",PMC4047027,PMC4047027_4
