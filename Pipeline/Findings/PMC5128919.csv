The study identified two non-structural proteins (NSP2 and NSP3) in the chikungunya virus that exhibit RNA interference (RNAi) suppressor activity.,PMC5128919,PMC5128919_0
The findings suggest that NSP2 and NSP3 have RNAi suppressor activity by binding to small RNA molecules and suppressing RNAi-mediated gene silencing.,PMC5128919,PMC5128919_1
"The study revealed that the RNAi suppressor activity of NSP2 and NSP3 is conserved among alphaviruses, including chikungunya virus.",PMC5128919,PMC5128919_2
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to evaluate the binding of small RNA molecules to the chikungunya virus NSP2 and NSP3 proteins.,PMC5128919,PMC5128919_3
"The study showed that the RNAi suppressor activity of NSP2 and NSP3 is also conserved among small RNA molecules in other alphaviruses, as predicted using BINDn software.",PMC5128919,PMC5128919_4
