"This study presents the first structural and biochemical analyses of sosv-rbp, a recently discovered paramyxovirus protein, revealing insights into its folding, oligomerization, and neuraminidase activity.",PMC6815108,PMC6815108_0
"Structural analysis of sosv-rbp, a 6xHis-tagged construct, reveals a novel folding intermediate with an open conformation and a unique dimerization interface distinct from that of other paramyxovirus proteins.",PMC6815108,PMC6815108_1
"Biochemical analysis shows that sosv-rbp, like other paramyxovirus neuraminidases, exhibits neuraminidase activity towards sialic acids on glycoproteins and glycolipids, but also displays a distinct substrate specificity towards gangliosides, which may contribute to virulence and pathogenesis in sosv-infected hosts.",PMC6815108,PMC6815108_2
"Structural and biochemical analyses also reveal that sosv-rbp has a high affinity for sialic acids on glycoproteins and glycolipids, and that this affinity is not affected by the presence of other paramyxovirus proteins, suggesting that sosv-rbp may have a role in viral attachment and spread in sosv-infected hosts.",PMC6815108,PMC6815108_3
"Neuraminidase activity assays and structural studies provide insights into the role of conserved hexapeptide motifs in sosv-rbp oligomerization and neuraminidase activity, which may facilitate the development of specific inhibitors to combat sosv-associated diseases in humans and animals.",PMC6815108,PMC6815108_4
