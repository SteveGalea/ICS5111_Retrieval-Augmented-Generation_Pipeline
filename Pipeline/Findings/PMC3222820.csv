The study analyzed a total of 204 vp1 genes of fmdvs isolated from 34 countries between 2000 and 2009.,PMC3222820,PMC3222820_0
"The study found that there was unique synonymous codon usage bias in fmdvs isolated in a specific region, and this corresponded with the phylogenetic distance between them.",PMC3222820,PMC3222820_1
"The study introduced a new codon substitution parameter, ""emc"", the proportion of exact matching codons within each synonymous codon group, to investigate synonymous codon substitutions in more detail.",PMC3222820,PMC3222820_2
"The study found that there were differences in the codon substitution patterns between isolates from Korea and those from other countries, and these differences were significant (p < 0.05) for some amino acid groups.",PMC3222820,PMC3222820_3
The study used correspondence analysis to examine correlations between vp1 genes of the fmdvs and found that the distance between two coordinates within the same row or column in the graphs represented the Ï‡2 distance.,PMC3222820,PMC3222820_4
