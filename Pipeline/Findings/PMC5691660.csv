"Viruses can use their own nascent RNA as a scaffold to recruit host transcription factors, such as the viral transactivator protein VP160 in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), to promote viral gene expression. This allows viruses to hijack host transcriptional machinery and redirect it to their own benefit.",PMC5691660,PMC5691660_0
"Viruses can use host-capped RNAs as primers for RNA synthesis, such as in the case of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), to generate new RNA molecules for viral gene expression. This allows viruses to produce RNA molecules that can bypass host RNA surveillance mechanisms, such as the exosome and the 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1, and promote viral replication.",PMC5691660,PMC5691660_1
"Viruses can use termination of nascent RNA synthesis to create sub-genomic RNAs, such as in the case of the retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) and the flavivirus dengue virus (DENV), to generate regulatory RNA molecules that undergo a different fate than the main viral RNA genome. This allows viruses to create regulatory RNA molecules that can be used as microRNA (miRNA) precursors or as decoy RNAs to prevent cleavage of the viral RNA genome during miRNA processing by the microprocessor complex.",PMC5691660,PMC5691660_2
"Viruses can down-regulate host nascent RNA production for their own benefit, such as in the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) and the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), to trigger global degradation of host RNA. This allows viruses to redirect the host transcriptional machinery to their own viral expression and deprive the host cell of targets for the immune system, leading to lowering host protein production during infection.",PMC5691660,PMC5691660_3
"Viruses can use nascent RNA synthesis to regulate their own gene expression, such as in the case of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the human papillomavirus (HPV), to produce",PMC5691660,PMC5691660_4
