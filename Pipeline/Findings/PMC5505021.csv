The authors discovered that hsp90β in Vero cell membranes binds Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) on the cell surface and that the hsp90β-JEV binding and virus progeny are inhibited by anti-human hsp90β monoclonal antibody (mAb) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) in Vero cells.,PMC5505021,PMC5505021_0
"The authors found that the hsp90β-JEV binding and virus progeny are inhibited by anti-human hsp90β mAb and siRNA in Vero cells, while a previous report indicated that hsp70 family members are putative JEV receptors in mosquito cells.",PMC5505021,PMC5505021_1
"The authors discovered that JEV seemed to prefer binding larger hsps from hspSC70 in mosquito cells to hsp90 in primate cells, with hspSC70 preserving the conservative conformation that distinctly fits JEV, and shifts from hsp70, hsp90 over millions years of evolution.",PMC5505021,PMC5505021_2
"The authors found that hsp90β in Vero cell membranes bound JEV on the cell surface, and the hsp90β-JEV binding as well as virus progeny were inhibited by anti-human hsp90β mAb and siRNA in Vero cells, while hsp90β-JEV binding and virus progeny were not demonstrated in neuro2a cells.",PMC5505021,PMC5505021_3
"The authors found that the different roles hsp90β plays during the different viral replication stages may be another intriguing field for investigation, as hsp90β facilitates enterovirus 71 viral particle assembly in the human glioblastoma cell line SF268, while hsp70 family members are putative JEV receptors in mosquito cells.",PMC5505021,PMC5505021_4
