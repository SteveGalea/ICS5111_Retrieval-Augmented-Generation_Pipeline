"The study identified five lectins, conbr, conm, dlasil, dsclerl, and hml, from five different plant sources, with significant antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1.",PMC6430086,PMC6430086_0
"The lectins dsclerl and dlasil, in particular, showed high potency against HIV, with EC50 values in the low nanomolar range, making them potential candidates for the development of new antiviral agents.",PMC6430086,PMC6430086_1
"The study also found that the lectins dsclerl and dlasil exhibited high specificity for the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120, with KD values in the sub-nanomolar range, indicating their potential as diagnostic tools for HIV infection.",PMC6430086,PMC6430086_2
"The study revealed that the lectin dsclerl, in particular, exhibited high potency against a broad range of viruses, including those from different families, such as herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus.",PMC6430086,PMC6430086_3
"The study also demonstrated the potential of the lectin dsclerl as a therapeutic agent against viruses from the orthomyxovirus family, including the newly emerging pandemic strain of H1N1, which is highly pathogenic and has caused global health concerns.",PMC6430086,PMC6430086_4
