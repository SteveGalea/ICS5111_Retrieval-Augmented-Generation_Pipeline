"The authors present a novel dual-mode antibody surface display and secretion technology in glyco-engineered pichia pastoris that combines display and secretion in the same clone, preserving the assembly and secretion of full-length iggs. This technology uses the antibody dimerization in the ER to achieve capture of the fc region of a half mAb to an anchored fc molecule through covalent disulfide bond formation in the hinge region, while preserving the assembly and secretion of full-length iggs.",PMC3707868,PMC3707868_0
The authors demonstrate that this system is capable of discovering novel high affinity antibody lead molecules with improved production titers. The combination of display and secretion in the same clone enables the continuity and fidelity of the antibody discovery process and could lead to shortened maturation cycle and desirable lead developability.,PMC3707868,PMC3707868_1
"The authors present a proof of principle for the anchored fc bait as a dual-mode antibody surface display and production platform using glyco-engineered pichia pastoris. They show that this technology takes advantage of the native fc region as an anchoring surrogate, which simulates the process of antibody assembly and eliminates expression or stability biases that could be introduced through ectopic anchoring sequences.",PMC3707868,PMC3707868_2
"The authors describe that glyco-engineered pichia pastoris offers advantages over other established antibody discovery platforms. It is able to generate igg molecules with human glycoforms while maintaining the high transformation efficiency of yeast, and the tractability of a fungal system enables co-evolving the cell line and molecule of interest in the same experiment to generate ""genetically-customized"" production hosts for each discovered lead.",PMC3707868,PMC3707868_3
"The authors highlight that surface display boasts the ability to link genotype to phenotype. Libraries can be generated and displayed in the cell line of choice, such as glyco-engineered pichia pastoris, and selected clones can be fermented directly in small or large scale vessels to generate material for in vitro assays such as affinity measurements, cell culture assays, or physicochemical properties. Selected candidates can be fed directly into in vivo preclinical models via simple scale-up production in stirred tank reactors. This simplifies the",PMC3707868,PMC3707868_4
