"Two recent coronavirus emergences, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have resulted in severe disease, with the latter having a 38% mortality rate. While coronaviruses have frequently undergone host range expansion events, two recent events have led to the emergence of highly pathogenic epidemic strains.",PMC4442375,PMC4442375_0
"The functional receptor for MERS-CoV, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), was recently identified. MERS-CoV can utilize human, bat, and camel DPP4, but traditional small animal models, such as mice, are nonpermissive. The importance of small animal models for studying pathogenesis and for developing vaccines and therapeutics led researchers to identify the determinants of interactions between the MERS-CoV receptor binding domain (RBD) and mouse DPP4 (MDPP4).",PMC4442375,PMC4442375_1
Researchers found that two key residues in MDPP4 (A288L and T330R) could permit infection by MERS-CoV when mutated to the human DPP4 (HDPP4) amino acids. These residues lie within blades IV and V of the Î²-propeller domain. The importance of a288L can be understood by recognizing that there is a strong hydrophobic region in the MERS-CoV RBD that engages the equivalent HDPP4 residue (L294).,PMC4442375,PMC4442375_2
"The researchers found that removal of the glycosylation site, rather than addition of the charged residue at position 330, is responsible for regulating MDPP4 receptor activity. Removal of the glycosylation site, rather than addition of the charged residue at position 330, is necessary to permit infection by MERS-CoV, rather than addition of the charged residue at position 330. All derivatives of the DPP4 receptors are expressed at the cell surface and available to interact with the MERS-CoV RBD.",PMC4442375,PMC4442375_3
"The researchers found that while glycosylation is an important barrier, its removal is not sufficient to permit infection in the absence of the A-to-L modification at position 288. This suggests that while glycosylation is",PMC4442375,PMC4442375_4
