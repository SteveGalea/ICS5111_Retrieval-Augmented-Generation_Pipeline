"Infectious agents, particularly parasites, cause diarrhea in cats, with intestinal helminths identified in the feline alimentary system. In Korea, 26 species of intestinal trematodes have been detected in cats, with neodiplostomum seoulense (formerly fibricola seoulensis) being a major cause of serious diarrhea and enteritis.",PMC6409222,PMC6409222_0
"The stray cat in this case study presented with severe necrotizing enteritis, with intestinal crypt epithelial cells degenerated or necrotized, and numerous trematodes observed in the small intestine.",PMC6409222,PMC6409222_1
"The intestinal fluke Pharyngostomum cordatum, closely related to neodiplostomum seoulense, was identified in the stray cat through direct microscopy and PCR, with histopathological changes in the intestinal mucosa associated with the infection.",PMC6409222,PMC6409222_2
"The morphological characteristics of P. Cordatum observed in this study are consistent with previous descriptions, and molecular techniques such as PCR can enable rapid diagnosis of P. Cordatum infection in domestic and wild cats.",PMC6409222,PMC6409222_3
"P. Cordatum infection is an endemic feline disease in Korea, with the parasite detected in 63/438 (14.4%) feral cats from Busan and 3/41 (7.3%) feral cats from Seoul. Continuous monitoring of intestinal parasites in stray cats is necessary to allow for early diagnosis and control measures in domestic animals and wildlife of Korea, as stray cats can act as reservoirs, carriers, transmitters, and definitive hosts for many intestinal parasites, including potentially zoonotic ones.",PMC6409222,PMC6409222_4
