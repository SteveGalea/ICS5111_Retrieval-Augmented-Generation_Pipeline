"Case report: A 3-year-old girl presented with lower respiratory tract infection, AFP, and co-infection with human coronavirus (HCV) 229e and OC43. AFP associated with HCV infection has not been reported previously in the literature.",PMC4611905,PMC4611905_0
"Diagnosis: Differential diagnosis of AFP includes GBS, compressive and inflammatory diseases of the spinal cord, poliomyelitis, other enteroviral myelitis, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus, myasthenia gravis, drug and toxins affecting neuromuscular junction, muscle disease, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, and electrolyte disorders.",PMC4611905,PMC4611905_1
Clinical presentation: AFP occurs by the damage of lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord or peripheral nerves either by direct invasion or parainfectious and/or postinfectious immune-mediated mechanisms.,PMC4611905,PMC4611905_2
"Findings: In this case, csf and ENMG findings in the 1st week of paralysis did not support GBS diagnosis, and muscle strength increased, and dTR normalized during the period of mechanical ventilation. After 3 weeks, repeating lumbar puncture and ENMG did not reveal any pathologic findings, excluding GBS.",PMC4611905,PMC4611905_3
"Co-infection: HCVs, including HCV 229e and OC43, may cause more severe respiratory disease in case of immune suppression and with various respiratory agents rather than single infection. The study demonstrated that HCVs, including HCV 229e and OC43, co-infection causing more severe respiratory disease has been demonstrated.",PMC4611905,PMC4611905_4
