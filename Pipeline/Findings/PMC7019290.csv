"The use of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed for the characterization of all viruses present in samples, as well as the discovery of novel or uncommon infectious etiologies. This is important as many viruses that affect animals are zoonotic, and can also cause disease in humans.",PMC7019290,PMC7019290_0
"In the reviewed literature, the viromes of farm animals were relatively comparable, as many infections are subclinical, and disease association studies require deeper taxonomic annotation of virus sequences to the level of genus and species. Multiple signature viruses would be required to set up a viral fingerprint profile for each livestock type, as one genetic marker may not be sensitive and/or specific enough.",PMC7019290,PMC7019290_1
"The current state of the art is far from providing such information as the minimal metadata that is needed to select datasets for analysis, as over 90% and 40% of available studies did not specify farm type and age of farm animals. This limitation hampers cross-study comparison and future large-scale reanalysis and interpretation.",PMC7019290,PMC7019290_2
"The reviewed literature primarily focused on fecal virome, probably because fecal samples of farm animals are a non-invasive sample and are readily available to be collected. However, viral shedding of emerging viruses, such as eid viruses, can also occur in respiratory secretions, and viral mngs studies of respiratory samples of farm animals are substantially overlooked and underreported.",PMC7019290,PMC7019290_3
"The review highlights that data should be properly indexed and easy to find and assess, with rich and well-defined metadata that can be interpreted by humans and computers. By making metagenomic data “fair”, reusability of the data can be optimized so the data can be combined into meta-analysis settings, which is important for future large-scale farm animal virome characterization analysis that can guide zoonotic outbreak preparedness.",PMC7019290,PMC7019290_4
