"The study found that the tac1 gene, which encodes substance P and neurokinin A, was consistently up-regulated in the pbmcs and the hypothalamus of ev71-infected rhesus macaque infants. This suggests that the gene may play a crucial role in the initiation of the pathogenic events during the progression of ev71 infection, potentially due to its role as an inflammatory agent in the immune reaction induced by ev71.",PMC3879270,PMC3879270_0
"The study also found that the expression level of IL-17A in the lungs of ev71-infected rhesus macaque infants exhibited a sustained increase compared with the control group. This suggests that IL-17A, as a cytokine responsible for allergic diseases of the respiratory tract, could play an important role in the activation of the immune inflammatory effect through stimulating some of the inflammatory factors and neutrophil recruitment, exacerbating further the increase in the secretion of IL-17A by the recruited neutrophils.",PMC3879270,PMC3879270_1
The study demonstrated that the expression of substance P in the hypothalamus of ev71-infected rhesus macaque infants was remarkably higher than in un-infected animals. This suggests that substance P can improve the production of TH17 cells by targeting the immune system.,PMC3879270,PMC3879270_2
"The study found that the expression of substance P in the pbmcs and the cns appears to be correlated with the increase of IL-17A in the lungs, an organ damaged in the pathogenesis of ev71 infection. This relationship suggests that it could directly lead to the elucidation of the mechanism behind the pathological changes during ev71 infection.",PMC3879270,PMC3879270_3
"The study found that the dynamic up-regulation of substance P in the pbmc and cns appears to be correlated with the increase of IL-17A in the lungs, an organ damaged in the pathogenesis of ev71 infection. This relationship suggests that it could lead to an amplification of the allergic effects through the increased neutrophil recruitment by IL-17A, exacerbating further the increase in the secretion of IL-17A by the recruited neutrophils.",PMC3879270,PMC3879270_4
