"Proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by transmembrane protease serine (tmprss)2 is essential for the infectious entry of SARS-CoV, the novel coronavirus MERS-CoV, and the seasonal flu virus into host cells.",PMC3889862,PMC3889862_0
The spike protein of the 1918 flu virus is also cleaved by tmprss2 for activation.,PMC3889862,PMC3889862_1
"Tmprss2 and cathepsin B/L, the main activators of SARS-CoV, are also required for the activation of MERS-CoV.",PMC3889862,PMC3889862_2
"Tmprss2 and cathepsin B/L are not the only proteases that can activate SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses, as new studies provide evidence that influenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, and several coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, can also hijack other transmembrane serine (tmprss) proteases for their activation in the host.",PMC3889862,PMC3889862_3
"The contribution of cathepsin B/L to viral spread in the host might be minor, and confirmation of an important role of these proteases in viral spread in the host is required, as studies with cathepsin B/L and tmprss2 knock-out mice can be employed for these studies.",PMC3889862,PMC3889862_4
