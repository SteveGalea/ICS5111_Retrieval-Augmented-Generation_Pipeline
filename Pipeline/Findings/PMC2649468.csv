"In international collaborative herbal medicine research, there are often significant looming questions about product variability in species, growing conditions, and biologically active constituents at the time herbal medicine trials are proposed, as herbal medicines are already in widespread use, are often used in combination, and are drawn from plant sources with their own variability in species, growing conditions, and biologically active constituents. To address these challenges, researchers increasingly agree that it is important to establish a rational basis for dosing and standardization of biologically active compounds before conducting large-scale clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of herbal medicines. This effort can improve investigators’ ability to assess the risks and benefits of participation in large-scale herbal medicine trials, and more rigorous monitoring of adverse events and standardized reporting of research results for both safety and efficacy data can also be implemented to improve long-term efforts to enhance risk–benefit ratio determination for trial participation.",PMC2649468,PMC2649468_0
"In cross-cultural settings, there may also be a cultural difference in emphasis placed on standardized adverse events reporting. This challenge makes achieving agreed-upon standards of favourable risk–benefit ratio more difficult, and it is important to establish standards of evidence for demonstration of safety before conducting large-scale clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of herbal medicines. In order for international collaborative herbal medicine research to achieve its objectives, it will be important to establish standards of evidence for demonstration of safety before conducting large-scale clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of herbal medicines, and collaborations could “cross-train” basic and clinical investigators to more fully appreciate the concepts and practices of the traditional herbal medicine medicine traditions, and developing host countries would need to develop the basic literacy, knowledge, and skills among traditional medicine practitioners so that they see the value of rigorous clinical research.",PMC2649468,PMC2649468_1
