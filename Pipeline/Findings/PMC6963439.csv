"A receptor-binding domain (rbd) vaccine based on rbds, major virulence determinants of Clostridio difficile, has been developed as a promising method for cdi prevention.",PMC6963439,PMC6963439_0
The vaccine candidate induced a significant humoral immune response in mice and provided complete protection against crude toxins extracted from a hypervirulent strain of C. difficile.,PMC6963439,PMC6963439_1
The vaccine candidate elicited a stronger humoral immune response and provided greater protection against toxins of C. difficile than univalent vaccine candidates.,PMC6963439,PMC6963439_2
"The rbd-tcda/b vaccine induced the production of more types and higher levels of rbd-specific antibodies, causing a difference in the protection level offered against toxins.",PMC6963439,PMC6963439_3
"Even a small dose of the bivalent vaccine candidate conferred remarkable protection against toxins of C. difficile on the host, indicating that rbds can be used as a relatively efficacious target for immunization.",PMC6963439,PMC6963439_4
