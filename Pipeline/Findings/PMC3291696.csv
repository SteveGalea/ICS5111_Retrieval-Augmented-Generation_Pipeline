"A study of 1,374 long-term care facility residents in Canada found that visiting an emergency department was associated with a threefold increased risk of acquiring a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection.",PMC3291696,PMC3291696_0
"The study, which matched exposed and unexposed residents within the same facility, found that the risk persisted for five to seven days after the visit.",PMC3291696,PMC3291696_1
"The study, which was retrospective and used standardized and validated definitions for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, acknowledged limitations such as potential detection bias and the inability to correlate the risk of infection with time spent in the emergency department.",PMC3291696,PMC3291696_2
"The study, which included multiple facilities and emergency departments in Canada, suggested that interventions to reduce the risk of infection should be studied, and considerations should be given to the implementation of additional precautions for residents for five to seven days after their return from the emergency department.",PMC3291696,PMC3291696_3
"The study's findings, which were presented in a section on long-term care facility residents, highlighted the importance of identifying specific sources of transmission in emergency departments and monitoring for compliance to infection control guidelines and policies.",PMC3291696,PMC3291696_4
