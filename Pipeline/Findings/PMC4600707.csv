"The patient's initial laboratory tests revealed abnormal levels of sodium, decreased to 123 meq/L, and elevation of amylase to 1,570 U/L, and lipase to 2,860 U/L. These findings indicate the presence of acute necrotizing pancreatitis.",PMC4600707,PMC4600707_3
The patient's initial abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans revealed necrosis of the pancreas body and tail and a portal vein thrombus of 2 cm observed in the main portal vein. Bilateral pleural effusions were also observed on CT scans. These findings suggest the presence of severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis associated with M. Pneumoniae infection in the pediatric population.,PMC4600707,PMC4600707_4
