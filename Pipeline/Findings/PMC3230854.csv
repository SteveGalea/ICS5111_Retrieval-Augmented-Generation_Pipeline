"Viral control at the level of eIF2 is not limited to the phosphorylation of eIF2α by PKR, as activation or inhibition of this factor by other members of the same family of eIF2α kinases can also occur under specific stress conditions.",PMC3230854,PMC3230854_0
"The formation of stress granules (SGs) is part of the cellular response to stress generated by viral infection, and it is induced by different alterations related to the initiation step of cellular protein synthesis, such as phosphorylation of eIF2α or alterations of expression level or function of translational initiation factors, specifically those involved in the initiation phase, such as eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4H, or poly A-binding protein (PABP), or by preventing the formation of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAiCtc by inhibiting the met-tRNAiC association.",PMC3230854,PMC3230854_1
"SGs are not permanent structures, but they disassemble when the cell recovers from a sublethal stress, and consequently protein synthesis is restored. The mechanism of SG disassembly is poorly understood, but proteins such as Staufen-1, which binds to dsRNA, and microtubules have been described as being important to SG disassembly.",PMC3230854,PMC3230854_2
"Because each virus undergoes a particular replicative cycle, the impact of SG formation is different for each virus, and the viruses could modulate the assembly, composition, or disassembly of SGs according to the replicative cycle.",PMC3230854,PMC3230854_3
"Viruses that interfere with the assembly of SGs in the case of cells infected with West Nile Virus (WNV) or Dengue Virus (DV) hijack cellular antiviral response effector proteins such as TIA-1 and TIAR and use them in the viral replication complexes, which confers cellular resistance to SG formation induced by stressors such as sodium arsenite.",PMC3230854,PMC3230854_4
"Viral control at the level of eIF2 is not limited to the phosphorylation of eIF2α by PKR, as activation or inhibition of this factor by other members of the same family of eIF2α kinases can also occur under specific stress",PMC3230854,PMC3230854_5
