Lassa fever is a severe viral hemorrhagic disease caused by the arenavirus Lasbiosa virus (LASV). It primarily affects humans in West Africa and is transmitted to humans through contact with infected rodents or their excreta.,PMC3497040,PMC3497040_0
"Infected individuals produce IgM and IgG antibodies specific to LASV glycoproteins, but neutralizing antibodies appear months after acute infection is resolved, and the titers continue to rise even several months after convalescence has been established.",PMC3497040,PMC3497040_1
"Lassa fever pathogenesis in humans is particularly hepatotropic, and patients with severe LASV hepatitis develop hepatocellular necrosis. In contrast, in guinea pigs, only foci of calcified hepatocytes are observed, and in cynomolgus macaques, multifocal hepatic necrosis associated with mild inflammation and hepatocyte proliferation are observed.",PMC3497040,PMC3497040_2
"Infected individuals develop respiratory insufficiency with pulmonary edema, alveolar hyaline membranes, myocarditis, and focal calcification of myocardial fibers and hepatocytes. Virus is detected in virtually all organs tested, including adrenal glands, spleen, liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes, thymus, heart, lungs, pleural fluid, kidneys, skeletal muscle, pancreas, salivary glands, ovaries, bladder, cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, cerebrospinal fluid, and aqueous humor of the eye.",PMC3497040,PMC3497040_3
"Downregulation of immune responses caused by LASV infection is involved in the pathogenesis of severe LASV hepatitis. Infected individuals develop dysregulation of the host immune response characterized by increased circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines including IL-1Î², IL-6, MCP-1, and eotaxin. Histopathologic changes include multifocal to severe central nervous system lesions at terminal stages, and the levels of MHC-II expression are significantly reduced in lymph nodes, resulting in lymphoid depletion and destruction of lymphoid",PMC3497040,PMC3497040_4
