"A national proficiency program for the molecular diagnosis of hand, foot, and mouth disease (hfmd) using armored RNA as virus surrogates was conducted in China, involving 41 laboratories from 27 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions.",PMC3187324,PMC3187324_0
"The use of armored RNA as virus surrogates was found to be a robust and stable alternative to infectious or inactivated virus in molecular diagnosis of hfmd, as armored RNA serves as a standardized method that would facilitate interpretation and comparability of results among different laboratories.",PMC3187324,PMC3187324_1
"The present report highlighted a series of problems regarding hfmd diagnosis, such as the low sensitivity exhibited by some commercial assays and the overall poor performance of some participating laboratories.",PMC3187324,PMC3187324_2
"The less-than-perfect scores observed in this eqa were likely due to a combination of poor assay performance (in particular, commercial assays a and d) and poor laboratory proficiency (contamination observed in 14 laboratories).",PMC3187324,PMC3187324_3
Future eqa should include more hfmd viruses with a wider range of genotypes to address the adaptability of rna viruses.,PMC3187324,PMC3187324_4
