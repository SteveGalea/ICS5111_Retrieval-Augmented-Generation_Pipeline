"The study found that MERS-CoV, a highly pathogenic virus, has a basic reproduction number (r) less than one in Saudi Arabia, indicating a subcritical epidemic that cannot lead to self-sustaining transmission in humans. This is supported by other studies that have reported similar findings.",PMC5643837,PMC5643837_0
"The study identified that the highest incidence of MERS-CoV cases was detected in the western and central regions of Saudi Arabia, followed by the eastern region, with limited human-to-human transmission due to variations in MERS-CoV receptors in the human upper and lower respiratory tract.",PMC5643837,PMC5643837_1
"The study found that the confidence intervals (CI) for the estimated r values varied considerably across the studied period in different regions, with reduced CI indicating more related secondary cases rather than sporadic case incidences.",PMC5643837,PMC5643837_2
"The study suggests that animal contact is an uncommon cause for MERS-CoV infection in the detected cases and that mild/asymptomatic cases, if detected, could reveal factors other than inter-human transmission that affect the MERS-CoV spread pattern.",PMC5643837,PMC5643837_3
"The study highlights the need for appropriate monitoring of cases, enhanced traceability procedures, and periodic updates of the r value to reduce transmission rate, diminish any possible opportunity of viral adaptation to human-to-human transmission, and obtain reliable data for future outbreak events in Saudi Arabia.",PMC5643837,PMC5643837_4
