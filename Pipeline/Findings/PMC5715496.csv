TMEV infection in mice leads to hippocampal damage and neurological sequelae due to the compromise between clearing pathogens and protecting neurons.,PMC5715496,PMC5715496_0
"Inflammatory monocytes are the primary driver of hippocampal pathology during TMEV infection, and their recruitment to the brain is mediated by chemokine CCL2.",PMC5715496,PMC5715496_1
CCL2 levels in the hippocampus peak at 6h post-infection and are mainly produced by neurons.,PMC5715496,PMC5715496_2
Genetic deletion of CCR2 and systemic immunodepletion of CCL2 reduce or prevent inflammatory monocyte infiltration during acute infection.,PMC5715496,PMC5715496_3
Neural production of CCL2 is necessary for CCR2-dependent infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during TMEV infection.,PMC5715496,PMC5715496_4
