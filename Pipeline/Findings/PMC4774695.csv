The recombinant adenoviruses carrying capsid protein-coding gene of FMDV o/Ind/R2/75 were successfully generated and amplified to a high titer.,PMC4774695,PMC4774695_0
The expression level of the target protein was not significantly correlated to the virus titer.,PMC4774695,PMC4774695_1
"The growth kinetics of the recombinant adenoviruses was similar to those of previous studies, and the virus titer decreased up to 10-fold at 4°C and 21-fold at 37°C after 60 h of incubation.",PMC4774695,PMC4774695_2
"The maximum growth of the recombinant adenoviruses was recorded during the first 48 h, and the virus titer decreased later on, possibly due to the unavailability of sufficient healthy cells for a further round of virus replication.",PMC4774695,PMC4774695_3
"The recombinant adenoviruses exhibited stability at 37°C for 60 h with a slight decrease in the titer, and the dad5 was less stable at 37°C compared to the recombinant adenoviruses, while had5/p1-2ab3bcm was more stable at 4°C as compared to had5/p1-2ab3bcwt.",PMC4774695,PMC4774695_4
