"This study identified the composition and site of assembly of the mhv replication complex (RC) using a panel of polyclonal antisera to mhv gene 1 products. The results showed that all mhv gene 1 products examined pelleted with cellular membranes, as expected for a membrane-bound RC. Integral membrane proteins p290 and p150, as well as products p210 and p44 (mp1), were also found to be integral membrane proteins.",PMC136101,PMC136101_0
"The study revealed that infection with mhv induced the formation of new cytoplasmic structures, dmvs, in both human and murine cell lines examined. These structures were detected using immuno-electron microscopy, and most importantly, the study showed that newly synthesized viral rna was detected in association with dmvs. These findings suggest that dmvs are the site of mhv RC assembly and viral rna synthesis.",PMC136101,PMC136101_1
"The study showed that the dmvs harboring the mhv RC presented themselves as loosely arranged vesicles, raising questions regarding the assembly and stability of the RC. The formation of such structures may facilitate the replication of the mhv genome and may help to understand the mechanism used to localize and assemble viral RCs.",PMC136101,PMC136101_2
"The study revealed that several examples of “chaining” ish signals, corresponding to the 500-nt riboprobe piece hybridized to the target viral rna, were detected. Analysis at 5 hours post-infection, the time of peak mRNA synthesis, revealed that the majority of rRNA detected by both the gene 1 and 7 riboprobes was associated with the dmvs. These findings suggest that both genomic and subgenomic rNAs are present on the same dmvs.",PMC136101,PMC136101_3
"The study showed that expression of eav gene 1 products was sufficient for the generation of dmvs, membrane recruitment, and the order of mhv RC assembly. These findings extend the previous studies of sethna and Brian, which showed that coexpression of eav nsp2 and nsp3 was sufficient for the induction and formation of dmvs (32). Further investigation will be required to determine if endosomes are indeed involved",PMC136101,PMC136101_4
