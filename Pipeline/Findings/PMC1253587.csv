"The study identified a new epitope on the gp41 envelope protein of HIV that is targeted by a human antibody, called d5-igg1, which inhibits viral entry into cells.",PMC1253587,PMC1253587_0
"The epitope is located in a hydrophobic pocket in the inner coil of the gp41 prehairpin intermediate, which is a conserved region across different HIV subtypes and isolates.",PMC1253587,PMC1253587_1
"The study showed that mutations in the amino acids lining this pocket, which are critical for viral fusion, confer resistance to neutralization by d5-igg1.",PMC1253587,PMC1253587_2
"The study also found that the d5-igg1 antibody inhibits the infectivity of a diverse range of HIV isolates, including viruses from different subtypes and viruses with reduced sensitivity to other entry inhibitors such as T20 and the broadly neutralizing antibodies IgG1b12 and 2F5.",PMC1253587,PMC1253587_3
"The study suggested that the hydrophobic pocket in the inner coil of the gp41 prehairpin intermediate qualifies as a ""hot spot"" for fusion inhibition and represents a conserved epitope that is targeted by a variety of protein-protein interactions, including peptide and peptidomimetic fusion inhibitors.",PMC1253587,PMC1253587_4
"The study also found that the peptide entry inhibitor T20 neutralized all of the 19 viruses tested, whereas d5-igg1, despite inhibiting viral fusion by a T20-like mechanism and targeting a conserved epitope, was less potent than the broadly neutralizing antibodies IgG1b12, 2F5, and 4E10.",PMC1253587,PMC1253587_5
"The study suggested that the ability of d5-igg1 to inhibit HIV infection probably derives from its ability to bind a physiologically relevant epitope with high affinity, and therefore, the identification of this new neutralizing epitope provides new hope for HIV vaccine designs aimed at eliciting neutralizing antibodies.",PMC1253587,PMC1253587_6
"The study showed that both structures of the synthetic antigens, izn36 and 5h, have repeatedly elicited high-titer nonneutralizing antibodies in experimental animals, including rhesus macaques, but",PMC1253587,PMC1253587_7
