The spatial effects of SARS input-output flows were positive for regions with origin-based spatial dependence and negative for regions with origin-to-destination based spatial dependence.,PMC4770707,PMC4770707_0
"Migrant flows were affected positively by both origin-based and destination-based spatial dependence, while hospitalization flows were affected positively by destination-based spatial dependence but negatively by origin-to-destination based spatial dependence.",PMC4770707,PMC4770707_1
"Direct effects accounted for 78% of SARS input-output flows, which was 3.56 times greater than the indirect effects.",PMC4770707,PMC4770707_2
"Regional income differences drove the SARS input-output flows, with urban income having a positive effect and rural income having a negative effect.",PMC4770707,PMC4770707_3
"Railway capacity, per person GDP, urban rate, and the law of distance decay also affected the input-output flows.",PMC4770707,PMC4770707_4
