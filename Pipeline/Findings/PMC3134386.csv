"A single-dose vaccination with vaccinia virus (vtt) through each of four different routes (i.n., i.o., i.m., and s.c.) induced long-lasting antivaccinia neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses in mice.",PMC3134386,PMC3134386_0
Higher levels (4.4-fold) of nAbs were induced via the mucosal i.n. and i.o. inoculations when compared with the s.c. route.,PMC3134386,PMC3134386_1
Mucosal vtt vaccination (i.n. or i.o.) conferred complete protection against mucosal routes of viral challenges.,PMC3134386,PMC3134386_2
"Mucosal vtt vaccination overcame preexisting antivaccinia immunity generated through skin or s.c., i.n., or i.o. route of vtt vaccination.",PMC3134386,PMC3134386_3
"The route of vtt vaccination determines the level of long-lasting nAbs induced, and different route of vaccination may have different protective effects.",PMC3134386,PMC3134386_4
