"The study reports the first isolation and complete genome sequence of the chikungunya virus in Zhejiang, China, in 2012.",PMC3867435,PMC3867435_0
"The study reveals that the chikungunya virus in Zhejiang is distributed inside the southeast Asian clade that initially spread from India, and it shares its greatest identity with a strain imported to Taiwan from Indonesia.",PMC3867435,PMC3867435_1
"The study suggests that the chikungunya virus in Zhejiang is distributed inside the southeast Asian clade that initially spread from India, and it diverged along two different routes: one to southeast Asia from the 1950s to 1980s where it became locally endemic, and the other through the Indian Ocean to southeast Asia and Europe.",PMC3867435,PMC3867435_2
"The study indicates that there is no mutation from alanine to valine in the e1 226 position in the chikungunya virus in Zhejiang, while there were many alanine-to-valine substitutions in e1 glycoprotein isolates in the Indian Ocean lineage.",PMC3867435,PMC3867435_3
"The study highlights the need for more detailed molecular epidemiology data to further understand, monitor, and evaluate the threats to the Zhejiang region as more imported viruses emerge and are detected in China.",PMC3867435,PMC3867435_4
"(Bonus finding) The study proposes a modified workflow using CDNA-AFLP for virus discovery, involving two steps: sample pre-processing, including WGA and ethanol precipitation for purification, and library construction using Platinum Taq for substitutions, with added quality control steps to ensure sample concentration. This modified method is suitable for determining an unrecognized viral agent in samples from patients of great medical interest or novel viral pathogens in some circumstances.",PMC3867435,PMC3867435_5
