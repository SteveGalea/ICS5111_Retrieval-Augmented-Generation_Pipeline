"Glutathione-mediated deglutathionylation of viral proteases, such as hsv-1 protein kinase and chikungunya virus nsp2, is a novel mechanism of infection control. This process inhibits the premature activation of some viral protein functions, such as hsv-1 protein kinase, which would be detrimental for the cells and the virus, and promotes their activation at the optimal timing for viral maturation and spread.",PMC6723385,PMC6723385_0
"Glutathione-mediated deglutathionylation of bacterial proteins, such as the cytolysin Llo, is involved in the resolution of the disease caused by bacteria such as Borrelia burgdorferi. This process regulates the activity of many transcription factors, including Llo, and affects bacterial infections, representing a potential mechanism of virulence.",PMC6723385,PMC6723385_1
"Glutathione-mediated deglutathionylation of nuclear factor kappa β (NFκB) is involved in the regulation of the NFκB signaling pathway in various contexts, such as infections, inflammation, and cell proliferation/apoptosis. This process inhibits the premature activation of some protein functions, such as NFκB, which would be detrimental for the cells and the virus, and promotes their activation at the optimal timing for viral maturation and spread.",PMC6723385,PMC6723385_2
"Glutathione-mediated deglutathionylation of bacterial proteins, such as the p50 subunit of NFκB, is involved in the regulation of the NFκB signaling pathway in epithelial cells stimulated with interleukin-17α. This process inhibits the premature activation of some protein functions, such as the p50 subunit of NFκB, which would be detrimental for the cells and the virus, and promotes their activation at the optimal timing for viral maturation and spread.",PMC6723385,PMC6723385_3
"Glutathione-mediated deglutathionylation of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β at the conserved cysteine cys-188 protects it from ros deactivation, making it necessary for maintaining cytokine bioactivity",PMC6723385,PMC6723385_4
