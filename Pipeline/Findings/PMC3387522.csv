"The study demonstrated efficacy of the antibody-biocide fusion product, 4h9-g1-ll37, in treating cryptosporidiosis in calves through improved health parameters and reduced oocyst shedding.",PMC3387522,PMC3387522_0
"The study showed that the treatment regimen consisting of an initial elevated dose during the first 4 h after challenge is important to achieve a therapeutic effect, followed by subsequent regimen consisting of 12-h interval dosing.",PMC3387522,PMC3387522_1
The study provided proof of concept for a novel biotherapeutic in a clinical model for cryptosporidiosis using the least possible number of animals and the highest technically feasible oral treatment dose.,PMC3387522,PMC3387522_2
The study revealed that reduction of oocyst shedding is an important factor in helping reduce the parasite pool in the environment and might make a significant contribution to a comprehensive cryptosporidium control program of any given farm.,PMC3387522,PMC3387522_3
"The study showed that a reduction of oocyst shedding in treated animals was not detected, but the study design was strong enough to demonstrate significance in oocyst shedding and overall health parameters, despite the fact that two control animals were lost prematurely due to unrelated complications.",PMC3387522,PMC3387522_4
"The study suggested that lower but multiple challenge dose than that used in the present study might allow a lower treatment dose of the antibody-biocide fusion product to achieve efficacy, as lower oocyst challenge number which results in a lower number of shed oocysts would allow a lower treatment dose of the product to achieve efficacy, as a lower oocyst challenge number which results in a lower number of shed oocysts would allow a lower treatment dose of the product to achieve efficacy.",PMC3387522,PMC3387522_5
