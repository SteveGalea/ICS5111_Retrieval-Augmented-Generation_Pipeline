"The study found that patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) had a lower likelihood of viral infection than patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with a significant difference observed for influenza A viruses.",PMC5813982,PMC5813982_0
"The study also found that HCAP patients had a lower likelihood of multi-bacterial or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, with MRSA infection being the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality in HCAP patients.",PMC5813982,PMC5813982_1
"The study reported that HCAP patients had a higher rate of bacterial detection, with multi-bacterial or MDR bacterial infection being the most important concern in HCAP patients.",PMC5813982,PMC5813982_2
The study showed that viral infection did not affect the clinical prognosis of patients with HCAP or CAP.,PMC5813982,PMC5813982_3
"The study highlighted the need for more timely and sensitive microbiological methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to enable early bacterial detection and pathogen-directed therapy, as the conventional microbiological studies, including blood culturing and sputum or endotracheal aspirate gram staining and culturing, were found to have low rates of bacterial detection in this study.",PMC5813982,PMC5813982_4
