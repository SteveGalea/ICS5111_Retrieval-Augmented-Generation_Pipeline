"Both primary and secondary dengue infections result in a majority of broadly cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing dengue-specific human antibodies, with only a minor fraction of the total dengue-specific antibody response being responsible for potent neutralization of the homologous virus.",PMC3119640,PMC3119640_0
"Many antibodies generated from dengue-infected individuals bind to epitopes other than those on the lateral ridge and a strand of the dengue virus envelope protein, including prm protein, which is required for proper folding and assembly of flavivirus particles in the endoplasmic reticulum and for preventing adventitious fusion of the virus in the acidic environment of the trans-golgi network.",PMC3119640,PMC3119640_1
"The majority of surface-exposed viral protein in the denuvirion consists of the ectodomain of the envelope protein e, as the e protein, with approximately 500 amino acids, is significantly larger than the approximately 166 amino acid prm protein.",PMC3119640,PMC3119640_2
"Some antibodies generated from dengue-infected individuals bind to epitopes on edi or edii, which are required for the proper folding and assembly of flavivirus particles in the endoplasmic reticulum, and may alter the potency of antibodies that bind specific epitopes on e, including the cross-reactive antibodies that bind the fusion loop in dii.",PMC3119640,PMC3119640_3
"The prm protein is required for the proper folding and assembly of flavivirus particles in the endoplasmic reticulum and for preventing adventitious fusion of the virus in the acidic environment of the trans-golgi network, and many antibodies generated from dengue-infected individuals bind prm protein. Additionally, immature, non-infectious particles can become infectious in the presence of prm antibody by enhancing the ability of immature dengue virions to infect Fc-receptor bearing cells in vitro.",PMC3119640,PMC3119640_4
