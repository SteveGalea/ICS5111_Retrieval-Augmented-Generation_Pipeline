"Lycorine, a natural compound isolated from Amaryllis spp., inhibits the replication of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in vitro and in vivo.",PMC3212826,PMC3212826_0
"Lycorine blocks the elongation of the viral polyproteid during protein synthesis, which interrupts the packaging of the virus and reduces the replication of virus, making it a potential drug candidate for the clinical treatment of ev71 infection-induced diseases.",PMC3212826,PMC3212826_1
"Lycorine inhibits the replication of ev71 strains prevalent in Asia, including three other ev71 strains isolated from clinical specimens from different regions of mainland China and belonging to the c4 genotype.",PMC3212826,PMC3212826_2
Lycorine treatment significantly enhances the survival rate of ev71-infected mice and alleviates acute symptoms and reduces pathological changes in the muscles of lycorine-treated mice.,PMC3212826,PMC3212826_3
"Lycorine shows potential application in the clinical treatment of ev71 infection, as it has an effective antiviral spectrum against ev71 strains prevalent in mainland China and has better efficiency against ev71 infection than ribavirin, as shown in IC50 determination and evaluation by a mouse model.",PMC3212826,PMC3212826_4
