"The study found that rapid multiplex testing for a broad panel of respiratory viruses was associated with shorter durations of hospitalization and appropriate management decisions, including the institution of antivirals and a trend toward antibiotic de-escalation in patients with influenza virus positivity.",PMC5853820,PMC5853820_0
"The study also revealed that the ability to detect a wide range of viruses might be more cost-effective and sufficient for the purposes of antimicrobial stewardship in hospitalized adults, as testing only for viruses commonly linked to lower respiratory tract infections was sufficient for this population.",PMC5853820,PMC5853820_1
"However, the study found that rapid testing for a broad array of viruses did not appear, by itself, to be useful for stewardship interventions among hospitalized adult patients, unless it could be combined with additional means of ruling out bacterial coinfections.",PMC5853820,PMC5853820_2
"The study also noted that the ability to detect a wide range of viruses might be critical for immunocompromised patients, as they are at significant risk of bacterial infection.",PMC5853820,PMC5853820_3
"The study found that among patients who did not start empirical therapy before testing and were subsequently found to have a positive rapid multiplex viral test result, they were just as likely as those testing negative for all viruses to start antibiotics within the first 2 days. This finding suggests that physicians can respond to a combination of viral and biomarker data to make appropriate antibiotic management decisions.",PMC5853820,PMC5853820_4
