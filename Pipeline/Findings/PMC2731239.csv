"In the context of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a mathematical model by Chowell et al. (2004) suggested that control of the SARS outbreak was based on rapid diagnosis coupled with effective patient isolation, and that key parameters in outbreak control include identifying what disease parameters are likely to lead to a reduction in the basic productive rate (r0).",PMC2731239,PMC2731239_0
"In the context of bacterial dynamics, models by Bacam et al. (2003) and Hancioglu et al. (2004) suggested that the viral population in any one patient will evolve away from control by the immune system or drug treatment toward faster reproduction and broader cell tropism due to antigenic escape on disease progression, and that successful therapy can suppress virus below detection limit but complete virus eradication is not possible under normal circumstances because of long-lived latently infected cells.",PMC2731239,PMC2731239_1
"In the context of modeling infectious disease, a model by Hoffman et al. (2008) suggested that the temporal control of nfκb response was because of coordinated degradation and resynthesis of iκb, and that iκb provides a strong negative feedback that can turn off the nfκb response.",PMC2731239,PMC2731239_2
"In the context of modeling disease spread and containment, a model by Carlotti et al. (2005) demonstrated that nfκb is localized in the cytoplasm at rest because of its association with iκb and the export of nfκb from the nucleus.",PMC2731239,PMC2731239_3
"In the context of modeling disease spread and containment, a model by Sanchez et al. (2005) suggested that the activation dynamics of the transcription factor nfκb exhibit damped oscillatory behavior when cells are stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFα) but stable behavior when stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).",PMC2731239,PMC2731239_4
