"This study identified linear determinants as the main targets of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) antibodies in infected individuals, which are more easily identifiable in a medium-throughput approach.",PMC3497641,PMC3497641_0
"The antibody response against linear determinants was attributed to a persisting IgG3 response, which was detectable even at 21 months post-infection (p.i.).",PMC3497641,PMC3497641_1
This study found that only three structural proteins (capsid protein and E2 and E3 glycoproteins) and one nonstructural protein (NSP3) contained linear epitopes recognized by patient anti-CHIKV antibodies.,PMC3497641,PMC3497641_2
Computational analysis revealed that the differential binding capacity of patient plasma antibodies to different CHIKV isolates with different epitope sequences could be due to a loss of epitope-antibody binding capacity when the amino acid at position 252 is changed from Q to K between SGP11 and IMT isolates.,PMC3497641,PMC3497641_3
"This study showed that the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein epitope recognized by patient anti-CHIKV antibodies, between amino acids 2800 and 2818, is still detectable at 21 months p.i., making it an attractive candidate for seroepidemiology studies.",PMC3497641,PMC3497641_4
