"The incidence and mortality rates of influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections among hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients were similar to those reported in previous studies, despite the low rate of antiviral treatment. High-dose steroid usage and lymphopenia were identified as independent predictors of mortality among influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections.",PMC5290016,PMC5290016_0
"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections were most prevalent in the summer months, followed by spring, and were associated with low immune response to the influenza vaccine compared with that observed for the general population. High-dose steroid usage and lymphopenia were also identified as risk factors for mortality among RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections.",PMC5290016,PMC5290016_1
"Human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) infections were most prevalent in the summer months, followed by spring, and were associated with high rates of progression to lower respiratory tract infections and mortality.",PMC5290016,PMC5290016_2
"Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections showed a trend toward delayed viral clearance, and a few previous studies reported that high-dose corticosteroid use exerted protective effects against the progression to pneumonia and requirement for mechanical ventilation among HRV-associated lower respiratory tract infections, possibly due to a salutary immunomodulatory effect.",PMC5290016,PMC5290016_3
"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections were not observed in the patient cohort, possibly due to the low prevalence of hMPV infections among hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. However, hMPV infections frequently coexist with bacterial or fungal pathogens, contributing to the development of pneumonia.",PMC5290016,PMC5290016_4
