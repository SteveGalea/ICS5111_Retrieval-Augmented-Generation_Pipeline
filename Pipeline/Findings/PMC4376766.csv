"This study documents the co-circulation of at least 5 hadv types, including hadv-3, hadv-4, hadv-7, and hadv-55, in beijing during 2011-2013. These findings are consistent with reports from other cities in China, as well as from Argentina, the US, Egypt, and Korea.",PMC4376766,PMC4376766_0
"A multiplex one-step rt-PCR was performed to screen for 15 different respiratory viruses, and hadv is one of the target viruses. The reason for the positivity rate of multiplex one-step rt-PCR (45 adenovirus positive) being higher than that of viral isolation method may be due to the higher sensitivity of the former method and the potential for delayed specimen collection.",PMC4376766,PMC4376766_1
"The genome stability of hadv-3, 4, and 7 was confirmed in this study, as well as in earlier studies. Limited mutations and infrequent recombination may contribute to the long-term success of hadv-3, 4, and 7 vaccines, as these viruses have displayed a relatively stable genome for at least 20-50 years.",PMC4376766,PMC4376766_2
"In contrast to the apparent stability of hadv genomes in general, they are also known to undergo recombination. Strain bj04 and strain bj09 may have recombined between hadv-1 genome and hadv-2 genome within species hadv-c, which are intraspecies recombination events. Further studies on the whole genomic sequence and virulence determination will be required to elucidate the characteristics of this novel hadv type.",PMC4376766,PMC4376766_3
"Hadv-55 infection has gained attention in the last decade, as hadv-55 is an emergent respiratory pathogen due to recombination between hadv-11 and hadv-14. Hadv-55-associated outbreaks were reported to have occurred in military camps of Singapore and Turkey in 2005, and in a senior high school in the Shaanxi province of China in 2006. Efforts should be focused on a hadv-55 vaccine because of its stable genome.",PMC4376766,PMC4376766_4
