"A study found that Patentvel (PV) has strong anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects, as demonstrated by the results of an ear edema test, a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema test, a cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation test, and an acetic acid-induced writhing test. In the ear edema test, PV significantly reduced the ear edema thickness and inhibited the formation of edema in rats.",PMC3746661,PMC3746661_0
"In a study using model rats with pelvic inflammation, the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-8 in PV and dex groups were significantly lower than those in the control group (con group). The serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the PV group were also significantly lower than those in the dex group.",PMC3746661,PMC3746661_1
"A chinese medicinal formula containing PV was found to effectively reduce the weight of u14 cervical tumors in rats, and the mechanism involved is associated with inhibition of tumor cells in the G0/G1 phase, inducing apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of mutant p53 and Bcl-2 proteins.",PMC3746661,PMC3746661_2
"A study using model rats with pelvic inflammation also found that the serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 in the PV and dex groups were significantly lower than those in the control group (con group). The serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the PV group were also significantly lower than those in the dex group.",PMC3746661,PMC3746661_3
"The supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) fluid extraction (SFE-CO2) method was used to extract volatile substances from PV in a previous study, and 32 compounds were identified from the extracts. The total volatile of one extract consisted of hydrocarbon (49.65%), aldehyde (16.66%), fatty acid (22.38%), and terpene (9.04%) in another study.",PMC3746661,PMC3746661_4
