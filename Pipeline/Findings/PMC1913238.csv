"The study synthesized and evaluated novel β-l-deoxycytidine analogues, including β-l-hyd4c, hy3tc, and β-l-hyddc, as potential anti-hepatitis b (HBV) agents.",PMC1913238,PMC1913238_0
"The study found that β-l-hyd4c was the most effective anti-HBV agent, with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.03 μM, followed by hy3tc (IC50, 0.51 μM) and β-l-hyddc (IC50, 0.55 μM).",PMC1913238,PMC1913238_1
"The study also evaluated the triphosphates of these compounds and found that the IC50 of β-l-hyd4c triphosphate was 0.9 μM, while the IC50s of hy3tc and β-l-hyddc triphosphates were 0.21 μM and 0.99 μM, respectively.",PMC1913238,PMC1913238_2
"The study found that the cytotoxicity of these compounds was much lower than their anti-HBV activity, indicating a unique and high selectivity index.",PMC1913238,PMC1913238_3
"The study suggests that the 4-nhoh group of the β-l-deoxycytidine derivatives, including β-l-hyd4c and some other derivatives, is responsible for the strong inhibition by their triphosphates, and further investigation is warranted as potential anti-HBV agents.",PMC1913238,PMC1913238_4
