"The study compared the development of mature env-specific antibodies and neutralizing activity against a homologous eiav strain in horses vaccinated with dna-encoded eiav env and rttv-encoded env, as well as in horses vaccinated with a live attenuated eiav vaccine. The results showed that a regimen using eiav dna vaccine prime and rttv vaccine boost did not induce mature env-specific antibodies or broadly neutralizing antibodies, in contrast to vaccination with the live attenuated eiav vaccine.",PMC3518545,PMC3518545_0
"The study found that horses vaccinated with dna encoding codon-optimized eiav gp90 did not induce detectable gp90-specific antibody until after 4 to 5 vaccinations, and the induced gp90-specific antibody did not present any neutralizing activity, even to a homologous eiav strain.",PMC3518545,PMC3518545_1
"The study reported that horses vaccinated with a live attenuated eiav vaccine developed high titer, high avidity, and persistent igg responses to influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein (Hmg), whereas horses vaccinated with dna encoding Hmg did not induce detectable Hmg-specific antibody until after 4 to 5 vaccinations.",PMC3518545,PMC3518545_2
"The study demonstrated that horses vaccinated with dna-encoded env and rttv-encoded env did not induce broadly neutralizing antibodies, whereas horses vaccinated with a live attenuated eiav vaccine induced broadly neutralizing antibodies.",PMC3518545,PMC3518545_3
"The study found that the infectious molecular clone-derived eiav strain plgfd3v did not induce broadly neutralizing antibodies, whereas less diversity in immunogen composition was suggested to be a major cause of plgfd3v failing to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies.",PMC3518545,PMC3518545_4
