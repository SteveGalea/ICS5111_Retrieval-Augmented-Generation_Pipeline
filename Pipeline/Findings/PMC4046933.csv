"The Junin virus (JUNV) is highly sensitive to interferon (IFN) in murine cells, as evidenced by a drastic reduction in virus titers in the presence of IFN-β, similar to the inhibitory effect of IFN on IFN-sensitive viruses such as influenza A virus, SARS-CoV, and West Nile virus.",PMC4046933,PMC4046933_0
"Junin virus (JUNV) is highly susceptible to IFN in murine cells, with treatment of 1 u/mL IFN-β resulting in over 3-log reduction in virus titers, similar to the inhibitory effect of IFN-α/β on some IFN-sensitive lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) strains.",PMC4046933,PMC4046933_1
"Junin virus (JUNV) is impaired in its growth in primary murine cells, with the impaired growth being more evident at an moi of 0.001, suggesting a defect in virus replication in murine systems.",PMC4046933,PMC4046933_2
"Junin virus (JUNV) is less susceptible to IFN in vero cells, which are defective in IFN-β and IFN-α genes, resulting in a less potent IFN-mediated antiviral response.",PMC4046933,PMC4046933_3
"Junin virus (JUNV) is less susceptible to IFN in a549 human cell line, which is more IFN-production competent than vero cells, resulting in a more robust and sustained IFN-mediated antiviral response.",PMC4046933,PMC4046933_4
