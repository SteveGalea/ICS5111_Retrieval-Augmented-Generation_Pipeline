"According to the virtual screening and core hopping methods used in this study, the compound neo6 was found to have a stronger binding affinity with the protein ha1 than the compound zinc01602230. The binding affinity of neo6 with ha1 was also found to be more stable and have fewer dynamic fluctuations compared to the binding of zinc01602230 with ha1.",PMC3227604,PMC3227604_0
The molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the compound neo6 has a higher flexibility and conformational changes in its binding pocket with ha1 compared to the compound zinc01602230. This suggests that neo6 may have more potential for further modification to enhance its binding affinity and biological activity.,PMC3227604,PMC3227604_1
"The docking simulations showed that the compound neo6 has more favorable h-bond interactions with key residues, such as arg227 and asp92, in its binding pocket with ha1 than zinc01602230. These interactions contribute significantly to the binding affinity and stability of the compound neo6 with ha1.",PMC3227604,PMC3227604_2
"The molecular dynamics simulations also revealed that the compound neo6 has more dynamic fluctuations in its binding pocket with ha1 compared to zinc01602230. However, the simulations also indicated that the compound neo6 has fewer dynamic fluctuations and higher stability in its binding pocket with ha1 than the compound zinc01602230.",PMC3227604,PMC3227604_3
"The molecular dynamics simulations further suggested that the compound neo6 has a higher flexibility and conformational changes in its binding pocket with ha1, which may provide more opportunities for further modifications to enhance its binding affinity and biological activity compared to zinc01602230. This finding provides a promising direction for further drug development against influenza viruses using the compound neo6.",PMC3227604,PMC3227604_4
