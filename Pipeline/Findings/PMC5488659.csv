"In a study comparing host responses to highly-pathogenic h5n1 to those of less pathogenic h1n1, researchers found that h5n1 virus strains upregulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during virus spread, but the magnitude and velocity of the response differed primarily between virulent and mild infection [62].",PMC5488659,PMC5488659_0
"In a 2014 study comparing transcriptomic profiles for h7n9 and a human seasonal h3n2 virus to those of two other avian strains, researchers found that the h7n9 virus strain, which has been partially adapted to humans, more closely resembled the human seasonal h3n2 virus in terms of transcriptomic responses, indicating human adaptation for h7n9 [52].",PMC5488659,PMC5488659_1
"In a study using cell culture and high throughput 2-d hplc mass spectrometry, researchers found that iav infection leads to robust secretions of proteins, including those associated with antiviral cytokines, copper metabolism murr-1 domain proteins, and autophagy-related proteins [56].",PMC5488659,PMC5488659_2
"In a study using a lethal virus-infected mouse model, researchers found that the host responses to infection differed primarily in magnitude and velocity, rather than if a host gene was activated or not [62].",PMC5488659,PMC5488659_3
"In a study comparing a highly pathogenic h5n1 virus strain to a less pathogenic h1n1 virus strain, researchers found that the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus strain upregulated the expression of key proteins upregulated after infection, including mx1, ltf, and vim, while those that were downregulated included erc1, l1cam, and ctnnb1 [55].",PMC5488659,PMC5488659_4
