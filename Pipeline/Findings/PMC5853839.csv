Introduction of IPV: The articles in the supplement describe the lessons learned by global partners regarding the structure of the global coordinating mechanism for the introduction of IPV in almost all countries in a compressed time frame of three years. The implementation ultimately occurred at the national level with support from regional offices of the WHO and UNICEF and local implementation partners. Colleagues from these regional offices discussed challenges and creative solutions implemented at the regional and national levels when introducing IPV in countries like Indonesia and Uganda.,PMC5853839,PMC5853839_0

"DOLAN ET AL AND SUBAIYA ET AL (ALBANIA): Dolan et al and Subaiya et al provide evidence from a global landscape analysis and a recent evaluation from Albania that support the notion that caretakers and providers appreciate the health benefits of vaccines and deem them to outweigh the concerns of pain or inconvenience associated with multiple injections. These issues were evaluated by the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, which concluded that delivery of pentavalent vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, and IPV at a single visit was safe and effective, as well as acceptable to vaccinators and caregivers in many countries.",PMC5853839,PMC5853839_4
