"The study evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of two respiratory tract vaccine candidates, ndv-bc/s and ndv-vf/s, against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in a primate model.",PMC1887550,PMC1887550_0
"Both vaccine candidates were highly restricted for replication in non-human primates and did not shed significantly in respiratory tract tissue samples, making them promising candidates for use against SARS-CoV or other emerging viruses.",PMC1887550,PMC1887550_1
"The study found that a single dose of either vaccine candidate provided protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge, with no signs of clinical symptoms observed in the animals.",PMC1887550,PMC1887550_2
"The study also demonstrated that both vaccine candidates induced a robust cell-mediated immune response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from whole blood, as evidenced by the presence of SARS-CoV-specific CD4, CD8, and IFN-Î³ T cells.",PMC1887550,PMC1887550_3
"The vaccine candidates presented no evidence of enhanced clinical disease symptoms in the animals, and the study suggests that the use of these vaccine candidates may provide a new vector suitable for use against SARS-CoV or other emerging viruses.",PMC1887550,PMC1887550_4
