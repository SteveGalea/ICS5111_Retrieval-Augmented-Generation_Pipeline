This finding contrasts with the absence of similar fungal isolates in Europe. Potential explanations for this difference include: (i) the European fungus may be avirulent; (ii) North American and European bats may differ in their immunogenetics; (iii) Fungal infections in North American bats may be a symptom of immunosuppression; or (iv) Constraints associated with hibernation physiology specific to the affected species.,PMC2942877,PMC2942877_1
