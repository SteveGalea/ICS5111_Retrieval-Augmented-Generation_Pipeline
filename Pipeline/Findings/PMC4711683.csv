A study on the pathology of cytokine storm in severe influenza found that an enhanced broad immune response can sometimes worsen the outcome of disease. This suggests that immunomodulatory strategies and novel approaches in targeting the host's response to severe influenza may be beneficial.,PMC4711683,PMC4711683_0
"Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, using concentrated globulin preparations from pooled human plasma, was found to reduce inflammation caused by the influenza virus. This therapy may potentially be effective in treating severe influenza infections.",PMC4711683,PMC4711683_1
"A study on herbs used in treating severe influenza found that extracts from jiawei-yupingfeng-tang, a traditional Chinese herbal formula, can alleviate influenza-induced lung lesions with both antiviral and immunomodulatory activity.",PMC4711683,PMC4711683_2
"A meta-analysis showed that ccr inhibitor-treated mice had a significant increase in survival after being infected with influenza. This suggests that some inhibitors of interferon Î³ signaling, such as suppressors of cytokine signaling, may be effective treatments for infection with severe influenza.",PMC4711683,PMC4711683_3
"A study on the use of statins, competitive inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a (hmg-coa), found that post-treatment with statins-reduced mortality, lung lesion formation, and viral-induced inflammation by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in influenza-infected mice. This suggests that statins may potentially be effective treatments for infection with severe influenza.",PMC4711683,PMC4711683_4
