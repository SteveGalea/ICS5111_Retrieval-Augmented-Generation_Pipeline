"The study identified that approximately 63% of all lymphocytes in naive marmoset blood are T cells, with B cells being less prevalent at a ratio of 2:3 B to T cells. This is consistent with previously reported data in marmosets and humans, although one study found a higher proportion of CD8+ T cells in marmosets compared to humans.",PMC4129158,PMC4129158_0
"The study found that neutrophils, which play a pivotal role in the innate response to infection, comprise approximately 3% of leukocytes in naive marmosets. This is lower than the proportion found in mice but similar to the proportion found in humans.",PMC4129158,PMC4129158_1
The study demonstrated that marmosets can be used to model acute bacterial infections and that the immune response can be characterized in terms of the phenotype and activation status of all major immune cells and key cytokine and chemokine expression. This can aid in identifying correlates of infection or protection in medical countermeasures assessment studies.,PMC4129158,PMC4129158_2
"The study found that, in response to acute bacterial infection, there is extensive activation of all major immune cells, with differences in the activation status of parent cell types explored. This was observed in both the pneumonic and systemic forms of disease, with the spleen being more actively involved in systemic disease, indicating that the disease develops a pneumonic element regardless of initial route of infection.",PMC4129158,PMC4129158_3
"The study found that, in response to acute bacterial infection, all major immune cells expressed high levels of key cytokines and chemokines, with the exception of Rantes. This was expected, as the animals had succumbed to terminal disease.",PMC4129158,PMC4129158_4
