"A study conducted in Guatemala identified three specific biomarkers, fragments of host proteins, in the blood of individuals infected with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas' disease (CD). These biomarkers, with molecular weights (m/z) of 6.3, 7.5, and 15.2 kDa, have high specificity and sensitivity for CD, with more than 98% and 94%, respectively, making them useful for early CD diagnosis.",PMC2849606,PMC2849606_0
"The study also found that some of the most useful CD biomarkers, such as fragments of the host proteins fibronectin and complement protein C3, were generated as a result of the complex interactions between the parasite and the host. These findings suggest that T. cruzi may specifically target some of the host proteins implicated as CD biomarkers.",PMC2849606,PMC2849606_1
"The study discovered that CD is associated with the presence of unusually truncated forms of host proteins, including full-length fibronectin and complement protein C3, as well as several C3 derivatives, such as dimeric C3 and C3a desarg. These findings are intriguing, as they suggest that the interaction between T. cruzi and the host protein complement C3 could occur at several levels.",PMC2849606,PMC2849606_2
"The study also identified a 28.9 kDa fragment of the host protein fibronectin as a CD biomarker. This fragment was found in the blood of individuals with CD, but not in those with other parasitic diseases, such as malaria or babesiosis.",PMC2849606,PMC2849606_3
"The study found that the majority of individuals with CD who succumbed to cardiac causes died from this complication, highlighting the need for further studies of lipid homeostasis in subjects infected with CD. The study also suggested that human adipocytes may serve as tissue reservoirs for T. cruzi.",PMC2849606,PMC2849606_4
