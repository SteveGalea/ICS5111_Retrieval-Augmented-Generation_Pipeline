"Recoding, also known as translational recoding, is the utilization of non-standard decoding during protein synthesis, which can benefit gene expression in various ways.",PMC2808893,PMC2808893_0
"Recoding events can be programmed or promiscuous, and are often selected for during evolution due to their beneficial effects.",PMC2808893,PMC2808893_1
"Recoding cassettes, which include sequence elements responsible for increasing the efficiency of recoding events, can be composed of diverse sequence elements that promote rearrangements of tRNA molecules or affect recognition of tRNAs or release factors in the ribosomal A-site.",PMC2808893,PMC2808893_2
"Recoding provides a mechanism for the translation of downstream ORFs on polycistronic RNAs, as well as for setting a ratio between protein products produced from a single mRNA in viruses and bacteria.",PMC2808893,PMC2808893_3
"Recoding also allows for the incorporation of non-standard amino acids, such as selenocysteine, which requires the presence of specialized machinery such as selenocysteine tRNAs and translation factors.",PMC2808893,PMC2808893_4
