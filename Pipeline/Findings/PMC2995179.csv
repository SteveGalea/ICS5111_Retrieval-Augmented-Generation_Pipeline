"In the section ""Collaboration between hospitals and dispensaries,"" the paper reports that the collaboration between hospitals and tuberculosis (TB) dispensaries in China has been the main contributor to meeting and maintaining the global TB control targets of detecting at least 70% of new sputum-smear positive cases since 2005. The paper notes that the success of China's national TB program is noteworthy, as it has been the main contributor to meeting and maintaining the global TB control targets since 2005, despite the fact that most TB suspects first seek care at general public hospitals.",PMC2995179,PMC2995179_0
"In the same section, the paper highlights that the internet-based system allowed monitoring of the process as well as the outcome of the hospital-dispensary collaboration for TB control. The paper further notes that while increasing numbers of hospitals participated and TB suspects and cases referred by hospitals to TB dispensaries increased substantially, the number of patients acting on the hospital clinicians' advice and reporting to dispensaries (referred arrivals) hardly increased.",PMC2995179,PMC2995179_1
"In the section ""Shifting workload,"" the paper explains that the internet-based system required diverse inputs from the central and lower levels of government, including enhanced government commitment and a conducive regulatory environment in the wake of the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, funding provision including financial incentives for hospital and dispensary staff, systematic training of hospital and dispensary staff, administrative commitment at the provincial level, and a steering mechanism in the form of a local coordinating group.",PMC2995179,PMC2995179_2
"In the section ""Enablers and incentives,"" the paper notes that the strength of China's internet-based communicable disease reporting system is its integrated approach that combines reporting requirements of 37 important conditions. The paper further notes that China's national TB program has exploited the opportunity and the system to its own advantage.",PMC2995179,PMC2995179_3
"In the section ""Drawing lessons from this initiative in China,"" the paper suggests that other countries, including India,14 Republic of Korea,15 and Thailand, also have internet-based systems that have helped improve TB surveillance and monitoring. The paper further notes that it would be worthwhile to investigate additional benefits these systems may offer in detecting more cases earlier.",PMC2995179,PMC2995179_4
