The authors report two cases of patients with h1n1 influenza a virus infection presenting with multifocal pneumonia and severe respiratory failure.,PMC3223529,PMC3223529_0
"The clinical features of these patients, including fever, respiratory failure, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated levels of creatine kinase and liver aminotransferases, are consistent with critical illness due to h1n1 influenza a virus infection.",PMC3223529,PMC3223529_1
"Other infectious disorders, such as legionnaires' disease, may mimic h1n1 viral infection, and early and rapid diagnosis of h1n1-related respiratory insufficiency requires rapid screening during a pandemic.",PMC3223529,PMC3223529_2
"Clinicians should consider the possibility of legionella infection based on clinical history, x-ray abnormalities, and diagnostic weighted point systems for diagnosing legionnaires' disease in adults.",PMC3223529,PMC3223529_3
"The authors suggest that patients with h1n1 influenza a virus infection should be screened for legionella, which is not currently common practice, as the signs and symptoms of both infections are similar.",PMC3223529,PMC3223529_4
