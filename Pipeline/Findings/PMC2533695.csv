"This study identified five previously undetected viruses: a novel simian sapelovirus (sv49-vrdl1), a new species within the orbivirus genus (cmpv), and three emerging pathogens of livestock, including btv, ahsv, and ephdv within the orbivirus genus.",PMC2533695,PMC2533695_0
"The study also found that known and novel viruses can be readily characterized using limited sequencing, provided that they are in the high concentration expected from affected tissues of recently inoculated mice showing acute pathologies.",PMC2533695,PMC2533695_1
"Demarcation of species is largely based upon vector transmission, overall amino acid identity, and phylogenetic analysis of viral core or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase segments.",PMC2533695,PMC2533695_2
"The skunk orthoreovirus identified was isolated from culex mosquito pools, and it is likely to be a classified as either a new highly divergent serotype within the baboon reovirus species or a new species.",PMC2533695,PMC2533695_3
"Due to the paucity of known baboon reovirus sequences in GenBank, direct comparisons with class l and m segments for the skunk orthoreovirus and baboon reovirus (brv) species could not be made. However, the deduced sigma non-structural protein sequences share 83–98% amino acid identity within avian orthoreoviruses (arv) and 73%–94% identities within mammalian orthoreoviruses (mrv). The skunk orthoreovirus s3 fragment shares 78% amino acid identity to baboon reovirus, falling into a gray zone with regard to species demarcation, whereas the brv and skunk orthoreovirus s4 segment encoding the fusion-associated small transmembrane protein exhibits 79% amino acid identity. The divergence between btv and the less well-characterized Yunnan, srcv, or brdv exhibits between 21–37% identity within segment 2 and 7.",PMC2533695,PMC2533695_4
