"The study identified four epitopes on the s protein of SARS-CoV, located in the spacer region between the hr1 and hr2 domains and in the hr2 domain, which were recognized by 18 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against the s protein. The epitopes were mapped to linear sequences and found to be involved in membrane fusion.",PMC1346840,PMC1346840_0
"The study showed that mAbs targeting the linear epitopes on the fusion core of the s2 region of SARS-CoV were able to neutralize virus infection and inhibit cell-cell membrane fusion, consistent with results obtained from previous studies using polyclonal antibodies against multiple epitopes or mAbs against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV s1 region.",PMC1346840,PMC1346840_1
"The study found that the less-effective neutralizing property of one of the mAbs, despite its effectiveness at cell-cell membrane blocking, was not fully understood and required further investigation.",PMC1346840,PMC1346840_2
"The study identified the spacer region between the hr1 and hr2 domains as a novel target for the development of entry inhibitors, as it provided a new target for the development of SARS-CoV entry inhibitors based on peptide mimics of the linear epitopes. The spacer region, immediately upstream of the hr2 domain, was found to play an important role in mediating hr1/hr2 interaction, conformational change, and membrane fusion.",PMC1346840,PMC1346840_3
