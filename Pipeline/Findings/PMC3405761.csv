"In the context of predicting the spread of a fungal infection in a population of agar dots, the authors found that the method of effective transmissibility, which assumes that epidemics can be approximately described by a constant transmissivity over time, gives reliable predictions for invasion, even for a single realization of an epidemic. This method is more robust than those based on supposedly more precise methods, which infer data that are not directly available from observations. The authors also showed that the method gives reliable predictions in the presence of spatial heterogeneity in the transmission of infection.",PMC3405761,PMC3405761_0
"In the context of predicting the spread of a fungal infection in a population of agar dots, the authors found that the method of effective transmissivity is applicable to cases where hosts are placed on more complex networks, as long as the rate of change of the configuration of contacts is much smaller than the removal rate of hosts. They also suggested a possible strategy to extend the ideas presented in this paper to deal with epidemics with persistence, where immunity after recovery is not permanent, and to predict the stationary prevalence of infection in such networks.",PMC3405761,PMC3405761_1
"In the context of predicting the spread of a fungal infection in a population of agar dots, the authors found that the method of effective transmissivity can also be successfully applied to cases where the transmissility changes over time, as long as it remains within the bounds for the effective transmissivity estimated from observations. They also suggested characterizing the final state of epidemics in terms of the mean number of removed (i.e. ever infected) hosts, nr, instead of the probability of invasion, pinv, in cases where hosts are placed on more complex networks.",PMC3405761,PMC3405761_2
"In the context of predicting the spread of a fungal infection in a population of agar dots, the authors found that the prediction horizon, beyond which the uncertainty of predictions of the evolution of the epidemic is too large for predictions to be useful, is epidemic-dependent and also depends on how precise we want our predictions to be. They also suggested that different replicates of epidemics with given t will follow different evolutions that have a prediction horizon but will lead to the same pinv or nr [26,30,31].
