"The study successfully isolated Zika virus (ZikV) from serum samples of patients during two different periods of the Brazilian epidemic. The clinical isolates showed significant differences in their abilities to infect mammalian cells, with emphasis on the infection of human dendritic cells. The study highlights the importance of using isolates with low numbers of passages to study viral pathogenesis.",PMC6701881,PMC6701881_0
The study identified four nonsynonymous substitutions in the NS2A and NS3 proteins that distinguish the most recent isolate from the other two isolates. These mutations could result in an increase in viral fitness during the infection of human dendritic cells.,PMC6701881,PMC6701881_1
"The study revealed some nonsynonymous substitutions in the NS2A and NS1 proteins that could have an impact on the viral fitness in mammalian and insect cells. The viral genomes were fully sequenced, and the study suggests that the mutations on the flavivirus genome could influence the viral biological characteristics and fitness.",PMC6701881,PMC6701881_2
"The study showed that the ZikV isolate with the lowest infectivity in mammalian cell lines presented the highest infection rates in human dendritic cells from healthy donors, which is a more ""physiological"" infection model. This reinforces the importance of using isolates with low numbers of passages to study viral pathogenesis.",PMC6701881,PMC6701881_3
"The study observed significant differences between the clinical isolates and the well-established ZikV strains (MR766 and PE243) with an emphasis on the abilities to infect mammalian cells. However, the study notes that there is still a lack of information linking specific amino acid substitution(s) to viral biological characteristics and fitness. Future studies using reverse genetics are essential to define the role of the observed mutations in the differential infection phenotypes observed, especially in human dendritic cells, which could contribute to the studies of viral attenuation strategies that will ideally lead to vaccine development.",PMC6701881,PMC6701881_4
