"The authors identified a novel adenovirus, psittacine adenovirus hku1, in mealy parrots that was most closely related to duck adenovirus a of the atadenovirus genus. This virus was not detected in any of the healthy parrots and other detained animals without c. psittaci infection, suggesting possible synergistic interaction between adenovirus and c. psittaci in disease pathogenesis.",PMC4256287,PMC4256287_0
"A positive correlation between adenovirus viral loads and c. psittaci bacterial loads was observed in lung specimens, suggesting a possible synergistic interaction between adenovirus and c. psittaci in disease pathogenesis.",PMC4256287,PMC4256287_1
"The authors observed active viral replication instead of latent infection of psittacine adenovirus hku1 in lung and liver tissue cells using immunostaining, indicating that this virus may have caused immunosuppression among infected parrots.",PMC4256287,PMC4256287_2
The authors speculate that the high genomic g+c content of psittacine adenovirus hku1 may determine the tropism of the virus to infect psittacine hosts.,PMC4256287,PMC4256287_3
"The authors suggest that co-infection with psittacine adenovirus hku1 may have been associated with immunosuppression among infected birds, leading to higher c. psittaci bacterial loads in the lungs of psittacine birds and hence increasing the risk of infection in exposed humans.",PMC4256287,PMC4256287_4
