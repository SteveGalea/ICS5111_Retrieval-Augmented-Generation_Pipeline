"The highly contagious porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) major immunogenic determinant is the spike glycoprotein (S), which is crucial in inducing neutralizing antibodies against PEDV.",PMC4855837,PMC4855837_0
"Two different fragments of S protein were cloned and expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion proteins (rgst-COE and rgst-S1D) in E. Coli, but their expression resulted in inclusion bodies using various expression vectors, strains, and induction conditions.",PMC4855837,PMC4855837_1
Co-expression of trigger factor (TF) with recombinant proteins at 15Â°C was most helpful in achieving soluble production of rgst-COE and rgst-S1D compared to other chaperone co-expression systems.,PMC4855837,PMC4855837_2
"Purified proteins were detected by Western blot using mouse anti-GST mAb and pig anti-PEDV immune sera, and immunization of mice with these proteins elicited highly potent serum IgG and serum neutralizing antibody titers.",PMC4855837,PMC4855837_3
"Soluble production of PEDV S protein antigens, rgst-COE and rgst-S1D, was achieved by co-expressing chaperones, which suggests their potential use as subunit vaccine antigens.",PMC4855837,PMC4855837_4
