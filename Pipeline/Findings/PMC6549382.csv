"In the cohort of 424 pediatric patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) followed prospectively over 15 years in Kuwait, viral infections affected more than one-third of the patients, with cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) being the most common culprits in almost half of the cases.",PMC6549382,PMC6549382_0
"The high frequency of CMV infections (>20%) in the cohort can be explained by the fact that most patients have combined immunodeficiencies, which predispose to progressive infection with CMV.",PMC6549382,PMC6549382_1
"Patients with PIDs, particularly those with combined immunodeficiencies, are more susceptible to viral infections compared to other PID categories, with many patients being affected by more than one virus.",PMC6549382,PMC6549382_2
"The study highlights the importance of awareness among healthcare providers about PIDs and their potential association with severe or recurrent viral infections, as many PIDs result in poor antibody responses, and serologic testing should be avoided while antigenic detection methods should be used instead.",PMC6549382,PMC6549382_3
"Live vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should be avoided in certain types of PIDs, and any infants born into a family with a suspicious history of PID should avoid all live viral and bacterial vaccines until PIDs is ruled out.",PMC6549382,PMC6549382_4
