"Weakly transmissible vaccines have the advantage of not transmitting far beyond the directly vaccinated individuals, which makes them less likely to evolve than highly transmissible vaccines. This is because immune compromised hosts may allow a long-standing infection that leads to evolution within one host, but with weakly transmissible vaccines, revertants (strains that have ejected or downregulated the antigenic insert) have less within-host and herd immunity than the vaccine.",PMC5777272,PMC5777272_0
"The challenge for a recombinant vector vaccine, which faces competition from the pathogen and vector, is to choose a vector that has a suitably high transmission rate. This is because if immunity to the vector is widespread, vaccine transmission may be limited even when the intrinsic vaccine transmission rate is high.",PMC5777272,PMC5777272_1
"The choice of vector will influence several of the critical properties of a vaccine, and indeed, may have a profound effect on vaccine success, on vaccine evolution, and on side-effects.",PMC5777272,PMC5777272_2
"In the extreme case of a vector that is not found in the host population (e.g., is from a different species), pre-existing immunity will be absent, which is a benefit. This is because pre-existing immunity will be absent, and transmission may even be avoided by use of a vector from a different species.",PMC5777272,PMC5777272_3
"In the case of a recombinant vector vaccine that reverts to the wild-type state, revertants (strains that have ejected or downregulated the antigenic insert) are also blocked by ongoing vaccination, provided the complete vaccine elicits immunity against both the pathogen and vector.",PMC5777272,PMC5777272_4
