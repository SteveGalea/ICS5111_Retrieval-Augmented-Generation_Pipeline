"The present study applied the gexp-based assay, a multiplex RT-PCR with automated capillary electrophoresis, to simultaneously detect multiple viruses in 1699 nasopharyngeal specimens from hospitalized children with cap.",PMC5023126,PMC5023126_0
"The gexp-based assay covered a broad range of virus targets and had high sensitivity and specificity for simultaneous detection of multiple viruses, with a large size of samples tested.",PMC5023126,PMC5023126_1
The positive rate of virus infection was significantly higher in patients younger than 3 years than in those older than 3 years.,PMC5023126,PMC5023126_2
"RSV was the most predominant virus in autumn and winter, while in spring and summer, PIV3 and RSV were the most frequently identified with similar positive percentages.",PMC5023126,PMC5023126_3
"The gexp-based assay was less laborious than mono-PCR due to its automation and multiplex procedure, saving samples and avoiding well-to-well and pipetting errors. However, highly specialized laboratory equipment, namely an automated capillary electrophoresis system, is needed, which many clinical laboratories do not have.",PMC5023126,PMC5023126_4
