The study found that the positive rate of bacterial detection using lamp assay was higher than that using conventional sputum culture in sputum specimens of aecopd patients. This suggests that lamp assay is a more sensitive and rapid method for detecting pathogenic bacteria in clinical sputum specimens of aecopd patients.,PMC4509289,PMC4509289_0
"The study also noted that conventional sputum culture has limitations, including a long test period, low positive rate, difficulty in detecting atypical bacterium, and susceptibility to contamination. Lamp assay, on the other hand, has a shorter test period, a higher positive rate, and is less affected by mutations than other DNA-based methods.",PMC4509289,PMC4509289_1
"The study highlighted that the sputum specimen is susceptible to contamination by upper airway liquid, and recommended using a modified cytology brush technique through a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope to collect sputum specimens in lower trachea.",PMC4509289,PMC4509289_2
"The study found discrepancies between lamp and sputum culture results, which can be attributed to the effect of sequence mutations on pathogenic bacterium. However, lamp assay was more consistent with the clinical symptoms of aecopd, as indicated by the fev1/fvc value, which suggests that lamp assay is a better clinical diagnostic tool for rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria in clinical sputum specimens of aecopd patients.",PMC4509289,PMC4509289_3
"The study also noted that the sputum culture results were less consistent with the clinical symptoms of aecopd, which indicates that lamp assay may be a more reliable method for detecting bacterial pathogens in sputum specimens of aecopd patients.",PMC4509289,PMC4509289_4
