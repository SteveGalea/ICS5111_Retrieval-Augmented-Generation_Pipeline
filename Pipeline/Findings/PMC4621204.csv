"In a study from the People's Republic of China, 81 cases of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) were examined to investigate the respiratory infectious phenotypes and their relationships with length of stay (LOS) and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score. The study found that 38 cases were infected with viruses, 17 were infected with bacteria, and seven had both. The most common virus associated with AECOPD was influenza virus, and the study detected five patients infected with human metapneumovirus and six patients infected with bocavirus for the first time. The study also found that coinfection with both viruses and bacteria resulted in longer LOS and higher CAT scores compared to single infection or non-infection.",PMC4621204,PMC4621204_0
"The study found that the LOS of patients with AECOPD ranged from 4.1 to 16.9 days, with coinfection resulting in the longest LOS and non-infection resulting in the shortest LOS. The study also found that CAT scores were positively correlated with LOS during AECOPD.",PMC4621204,PMC4621204_1
"The study found that respiratory viral infection played an important role in exacerbations of COPD, as the two patients infected with influenza virus died during hospitalization.",PMC4621204,PMC4621204_2
"The study detected a wide range of bacterial species in samples from COPD patients, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella.",PMC4621204,PMC4621204_3
"The study found no statistically significant difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) among patients with different respiratory infectious phenotypes. However, the study detected five patients infected with human Metapneumovirus and six patients infected with Bocavirus for the first time, providing a new insight into understanding the etiological agents in AECOPD.",PMC4621204,PMC4621204_4
