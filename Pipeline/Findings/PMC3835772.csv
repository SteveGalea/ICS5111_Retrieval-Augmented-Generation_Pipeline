"The study utilized a computer program to detect potential pseudoknots in the full-length genomic mRNAs of various viruses, and found that over 90% of detected pseudoknots conform to the cpk-1 family, a common structural motif for maintaining a stable and compact pseudoknotted scaffold. The lengths and compositions of stem 1 and loop 2 of these pseudoknots showed variations, especially when viruses from different evolutionary groups were compared, suggesting the need for fine-tuning of frameshifting efficiency in different viruses.",PMC3835772,PMC3835772_0
"The study also found that the frameshift or readthrough stimulating pseudoknots, especially those in the cpk-1 family, are among the most stable pseudoknots within the viral genomic mRNAs, and their stabilities have been fine-tuned during evolution to be optimal for decoding events.",PMC3835772,PMC3835772_1
The study found that some HIV-1 viruses may utilize a novel mechanism that involves three pseudoknots to regulate frameshift efficiency at the gag-pol junction.,PMC3835772,PMC3835772_2
"The study proved the usefulness of its pseudoknot-detecting program, as over 70% of the detected pseudoknots ranked among the most stable pseudoknots within the viral genomic mRNAs.",PMC3835772,PMC3835772_3
"The study showed that viral genomic mRNAs do not contain strong roadblocking pseudoknots that would significantly stall ribosomes and induce no-go decay, as equilibrium-based mechanisms for the regulation of read-through efficiency were shown to play a functional role in translational recoding in murine leukaemia virus.",PMC3835772,PMC3835772_4
