"The study identified two rrxr motifs in the context of sftsv-gc and showed that mutation of these motifs or inhibition of proprotein convertase activity did not affect gn/gc processing or viral infectivity, suggesting that these motifs are not cleavage sites for proprotein convertases in the context of sftsv-gc.",PMC5113920,PMC5113920_0
"The study demonstrated that signal peptidase liberated gc from gn/gc and that deletion of the predicted signal peptide or removal of the amino acids preceding the predicted cleavage site in the context of sftsv-gc abrogated gn/gc processing and viral infectivity, indicating that signal peptidase might generate the n-terminus of mature gc.",PMC5113920,PMC5113920_1
"The study found that gn expression was required for particle incorporation of gc and that gc was mainly localized in the er when expressed alone, while coexpression of gn resulted in accumulation of gc in the golgi apparatus, the site of bunyavirus assembly and budding, suggesting that gn might function as a chaperon for gc.",PMC5113920,PMC5113920_2
"The study showed that expression of gn or gc alone in particle producing cells incorporated more gc and was more infectious than their counterparts produced in cells transfected with separate gn and gc expression plasmids, despite increased gn expression and particle incorporation under the latter conditions.",PMC5113920,PMC5113920_3
"The study suggested that the long cytoplasmic tail of sftsv-gn might mask a lysine at position -3 in the cytoplasmic tail of sftsv-gc, which is conserved between diverse bunyaviruses and is required for er localization, and that the chaperon activity of gn might depend on gn-gc interactions formed with high efficiency only after proteolytic separation of these proteins from the gn/gc precursor during glycoprotein biogenesis.",PMC5113920,PMC5113920_4
