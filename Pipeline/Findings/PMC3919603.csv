"The study demonstrates that RNA G4 structures, which are present in a high number of RNA sequences in the human genome, can act as translational recoding signals to induce both −1 and +1 frameshift (FS) and stop codon transfer (RT) in mammalian cells.",PMC3919603,PMC3919603_0
"The study reveals that RNA G4 structures, which are present in bacterial mRNAs, can induce ribosomal stalling (45).",PMC3919603,PMC3919603_1
"The study shows that RNA G4 structures, which are present in viral mRNAs, can induce FS and RT (46, 47).",PMC3919603,PMC3919603_2
"The study indicates that RNA G4 structures are capable of stimulating −1 and +1 FS as well as stop codon RT, thereby expanding the repertoire of RNA structures involved in translational recoding (48).",PMC3919603,PMC3919603_3
"The study suggests that the stability of RNA G4 structures, comprising eight hydrogen bonds and four purine stacks per helical step, is critical for redirecting ribosomes into another reading frame, making it difficult for the ribosome to melt the first G-quartets that reside at the opening of the mRNA entrance tunnel (37).",PMC3919603,PMC3919603_4
