"The soluble spike proteins of tgev and ibv bind to host cells through their s1 subunit, which contains two potential receptor binding domains (rbds).",PMC3761233,PMC3761233_0
"The soluble tgev spike protein binds to cells expressing the receptor apn only if this protein is expressed, and a neuraminidase pretreatment of the cells enhances the binding due to the loss of the ability to bind to sialic acids.",PMC3761233,PMC3761233_1
"The soluble ibv spike protein binds to susceptible cells, such as primary chicken kidney cells and tracheal organ cultures, in a sialic acid-dependent manner, similar to the viral tropism of the b1648 virus.",PMC3761233,PMC3761233_2
"The binding to sialic acids is more important for ibv than it is for tgev, as the effect of desialylation of cells on infection is more pronounced in the case of ibv than it is observed with tgev.",PMC3761233,PMC3761233_3
"The conformation of the spike appears to play an important role in the binding properties, as the soluble tgev spike protein shows a weaker binding than the fc constructs in all cases.",PMC3761233,PMC3761233_4
