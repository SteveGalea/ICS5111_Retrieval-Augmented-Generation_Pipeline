"In this population-based study with a 95% inclusion rate, the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization is 20.6 cases per 10000 adults per year, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most frequently identified pathogen.",PMC5804852,PMC5804852_0
"The study found that mycoplasma pneumoniae is commonly recovered (36 cases, 12%), and younger patients were relatively more likely to have mycoplasma pneumoniae or influenza infections, although atypical bacteria were also commonly recovered (28%).",PMC5804852,PMC5804852_1
The study found that patients with atypical pathogens had lower Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and Curved Ball (curb)-65 scores than other patients but required similar intensive care unit (ICU) care and length of stay (LOS).,PMC5804852,PMC5804852_2
"The study found that patients with dual pathogens had a trend towards worse outcomes, but the number of patients was low, and therefore a great potential for type II error.",PMC5804852,PMC5804852_3
"The study found that the likelihood of detecting pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was increased for patients reporting hemoptysis, and blood in sputum was reported in 30% of the first influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases from Mexico in 2009, whereas hemorrhagic tracheitis and bronchitis has been noted as a histological feature in severe cases in prior influenza pandemics.",PMC5804852,PMC5804852_4
