The present study successfully induced saon in a rat model using a combination of lps and mps with pulsed injection and evaluated osteonecrosis and associated metabolic disorders at two different time points.,PMC5892381,PMC5892381_0
"The study reported typical histopathologic features of on, including bone necrosis, osteoblast cell death, and impaired blood supply in bone marrow, which eventually induced osteonecrosis.",PMC5892381,PMC5892381_1
"The study also found significant bone loss in the saon group, accompanied by severe fat accumulation in red and yellow marrow regions, and abnormal high lipid levels in corticosteroid-affected metabolic disorders.",PMC5892381,PMC5892381_2
"The study identified additional important information on evaluations of osteonecrosis, including mortality rate, and other associated temporal changes in metabolism at two different time points.",PMC5892381,PMC5892381_3
The saon rat model is a suitable and cost-effective animal model to study cellular and molecular mechanisms of saon and potential drugs to be developed for prevention and treatment of saon.,PMC5892381,PMC5892381_4
