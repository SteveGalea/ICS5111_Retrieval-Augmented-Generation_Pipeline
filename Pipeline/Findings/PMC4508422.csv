"In a study by Li et al. (2015), a 24-plex assay was developed to simultaneously detect and identify 21 common respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and severe acid-resistant coronavirus.",PMC4508422,PMC4508422_0
"The study by Li et al. (2015) also found that 19.0% of patients had respiratory virus coinfections, including hepatitis E virus-human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus-human coronavirus coinfections.",PMC4508422,PMC4508422_1
"In a study by Pujol et al. (2014), a multiplex real-time PCR/reverse transcription-PCR assay was developed to simultaneously detect and identify 12 respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.",PMC4508422,PMC4508422_2
"The study by Pujol et al. (2014) also found that respiratory virus coinfections were associated with increased disease severity, such as human metapneumovirus-respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus-human coronavirus coinfections.",PMC4508422,PMC4508422_3
"In a study by Li et al. (2015), the cost for analyzing all 21 common respiratory viruses using the developed method was less than $4, excluding the cost of nucleic acid extraction and reverse transcription-PCR for RNA viruses, making it a useful tool for large-scale epidemiological studies of common respiratory virus infections.",PMC4508422,PMC4508422_4
