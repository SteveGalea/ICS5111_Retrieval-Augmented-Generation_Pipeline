"In both studies, self-collected nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs from patients with confirmed influenza A or B were able to accurately predict viral loads expected on the second measurement, with small and statistically insignificant differences between observed and predicted viral loads for both influenza A and B.",PMC3266138,PMC3266138_0
"In the household transmission study, viral loads determined from swabs taken at the second measurement by healthcare professionals were slightly higher on average than the expected values based on the random-effects regression model for both influenza A and B.",PMC3266138,PMC3266138_1
"In the household transmission study, the decline in viral loads over time for both influenza A and B was similar to that observed in the influenza resistance information study, where self-collected NP and throat swabs from patients with confirmed influenza A or B were also able to accurately predict viral loads expected on the second measurement.",PMC3266138,PMC3266138_2
"In both studies, trends in viral loads for both influenza A and B were able to accurately and reliably be predicted from a log-linear model based on the first and third measurements.",PMC3266138,PMC3266138_3
"In both studies, the lower limit of detection (LLOD) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for both influenza A and B were similar in both studies.",PMC3266138,PMC3266138_4
