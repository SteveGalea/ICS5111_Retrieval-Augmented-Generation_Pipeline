The present study demonstrates that the alv-j strain scau-hn06 produces an almost undetectable antiviral innate immune response in 1 week old chicks.,PMC4879323,PMC4879323_0
"Cytokines, including il-6, il-10, and ifn-Î², were induced in yellow chickens with tumors caused by alv-j infection, but ifn-stimulated gene expression was not induced normally during the late phase of alv-j infection.",PMC4879323,PMC4879323_1
The study reveals that alv-j was primarily recognized by chicken tlr7 at 1 day post infection and mda5 was the main sensing receptor during the late phase of alv-j infection.,PMC4879323,PMC4879323_2
"The study demonstrates that irf1 and stat1 expression levels are decreased in chickens with tumors induced by alv-j infection, suggesting that alv-j escapes through inhibition of the host antiviral immune response by modulating the jak-stat signaling pathway.",PMC4879323,PMC4879323_3
"The study highlights that functional isgs cannot be induced in the late infection phase, as irf1 expression is decreased as a target of mir-23b in white (recessive) plymouth rock chickens with alv-j infection, and the antiviral activity of irf1 is inhibited during the late phase of alv-j infection.",PMC4879323,PMC4879323_4
