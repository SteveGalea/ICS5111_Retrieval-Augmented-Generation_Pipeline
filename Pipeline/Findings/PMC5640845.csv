"A high-throughput screening (HTS) assay identified 13 drugs that inhibited dengue virus (DENV) replication, including calcium channel blockers (CCBs), cyclic nucleotide analogs (CNAs), and drugs targeting viral replication complexes (RCs).",PMC5640845,PMC5640845_0
"Among these hits, five drugs, including manidipine, a calcium channel blocker, showed full inhibitory activity against DENV replication.",PMC5640845,PMC5640845_1
"Manidipine-resistant DENV was generated by passaging DENV on Vero cells in the presence of manidipine, and two mutant viruses were isolated and amplified in the presence of manidipine.",PMC5640845,PMC5640845_2
"Viral rNA extracted from the mutant viruses showed mutations in the nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) region, suggesting a role for NS3 in DENV replication and a potential target for antiviral drug development.",PMC5640845,PMC5640845_3
"Manidipine administration to DENV-infected mice suppressed viral replication and improved survival rates, highlighting the translational potential of this calcium channel blocker as an antiviral agent.",PMC5640845,PMC5640845_4
