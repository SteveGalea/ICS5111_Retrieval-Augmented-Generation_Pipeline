"This study demonstrates that cx3cr1, a cellular receptor for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is expressed on the cilia of ciliated cells in hae cultures, the cell type targeted by RSV.",PMC4676609,PMC4676609_0
"Mabs against the g protein, a major neutralizing antigen in RSV, block RSV infection of hae cultures, but not in human epithelial cell lines.",PMC4676609,PMC4676609_1
"A mab against the g protein, mab 131-2g, neutralizes RSV infection of hae cultures but not human epithelial cell lines, suggesting that the use of hae cultures is important for accurately quantifying neutralizing antibodies against other respiratory viruses.",PMC4676609,PMC4676609_2
"Differences in RSV receptor usage between clinical isolates and laboratory strains have been well documented, and mab 131-2g neutralizes RSV infection of RSV clinical isolates but not of laboratory strains adapted to grow in immortalized cells.",PMC4676609,PMC4676609_3
"Neutralizing antibodies against the g protein should be considered for inclusion in vaccine candidates, as efficient neutralization of RSV infection by mabs against the g protein has been demonstrated in this study and in mice or cotton rats.",PMC4676609,PMC4676609_4
