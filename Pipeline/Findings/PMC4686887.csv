"A study by Li et al. In Sci. Rep. (2015) identified four high-risk areas (hras) for human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) and H5N1 viruses in China. These areas were based on the predicted probabilities of occurrence of the viruses, as well as the density of poultry, swine, and the distance to important bird habitat areas. The study found that areas with high densities of poultry and swine, such as live poultry markets, are potential breeding grounds for the viruses. The study also highlighted the importance of wild bird migration routes as potential sources for the viruses' introduction into new areas.",PMC4686887,PMC4686887_0
"The study by Li et al. (2015) found that the risk of human infection with avian influenza viruses is influenced by ecological variables such as land-cover patterns and meteorological factors. The study used Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) models to explore the contribution of ecological variables to the occurrence of the viruses and to map the corresponding risk distributions. The study also found that areas with a high risk of human infection with both H7N9 and H5N1 viruses, above-average densities of swine and poultry, and a below-average distance from the centroid to the nearest important bird area, are at higher risk of genetic reassortment between the viruses.",PMC4686887,PMC4686887_1
The study by Li et al. (2015) reported that the main epidemic seasons for H7N9 and H5N1 viruses in China are from January to April for H7N9 and from November to February for H5N1. The study also highlighted the need for sensitivity analyses for areas with sparse data to ensure robust inference.,PMC4686887,PMC4686887_2
