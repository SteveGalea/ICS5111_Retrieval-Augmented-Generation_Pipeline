The study aimed to select and produce a recombinant avian single-chain fragment variable (scfv) directed against peptic-tryptic digested gliadin (pt-gliadin) and related celiac toxic entities.,PMC4666168,PMC4666168_0
"Chicken immunized with pt-gliadin were used to generate cDNA, which was then amplified to create full-length scfv constructs.",PMC4666168,PMC4666168_1
"The study identified an enriched scfv motif that showed reactivity to pt-gliadin, which binds in a dose-dependent manner to pt-gliadin, comparable to polyclonal anti-pt-gliadin IgY.",PMC4666168,PMC4666168_2
"IgY competitively displaced scfv from pt-gliadin and natural wheat flour digest, indicating a common epitope of scfv and IgY.",PMC4666168,PMC4666168_3
"Scfv specifically recognizes toxic cereal peptides relevant in celiac disease, as it detects common and khorasan wheat comparably with binding affinities in the high nanomolar range, while rye is detected to a lesser extent. Notably, barley and cereals used as gluten-free alternatives, such as corn and rice, are not detected by scfv.",PMC4666168,PMC4666168_4
