"The study found that a highly passaged live attenuated vaccine strain of human cytomegalovirus (CMV), derived from the original AuJesZky strain, has mutations in the glycoprotein C (gc), gM, and ul21 genes and a deletion in the unique short region spanning the gi, ge, us9, and us2 genes [55–58].",PMC6824567,PMC6824567_0
"The study showed that mice deficient for type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) and TLR2 on a C57BL/6 genetic background are sensitive to PRV infection, as previously described [59].",PMC6824567,PMC6824567_1
The study reported that the viral genomic DNA of PRV-Becker and PRV-Bartha infected mice was quantified by using ul54 specific primers as previously published [60].,PMC6824567,PMC6824567_2
"The study identified significant differences in the quantification of single analyte IL-6, g-CSF, type I IFN (α and β) levels in plasma and/or tissue homogenates between mock-, PRV-Becker-, and PRV-Bartha inoculated mice, as identified by one-way analysis of variances (ANOVA) followed either by a Tukey's post-hoc test or a two-sided Dunnett's post-hoc test.",PMC6824567,PMC6824567_3
"The study found that the conversion of genome copies to plaque forming unit (PFU) was done for convenience of comparing our data to previously published data [8, 61], and that statistical analyses data were pooled from 2-3 independent experiments, with five mice per group used per experiment.",PMC6824567,PMC6824567_4
"The study showed that the specific target amplification was analyzed by melt-curve analysis using the MasterCycler EP Realplex 2.2 software, and that the amounts of PRV dna in samples were obtained by plotting ct values onto the standard curve and expressed as pfu/mg of tissue [61], which were identified by one-way analysis of variances (ANOVA) followed either by a Tukey's post-hoc test or a two-sided Dunnett's post-hoc test.",PMC6824567,PMC6824567_5
The study reported that the conversion of genome copies to PFU was done for convenience,PMC6824567,PMC6824567_6
