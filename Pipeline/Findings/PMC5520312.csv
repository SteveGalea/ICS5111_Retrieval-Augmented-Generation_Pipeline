"In a study evaluating the use of saliva for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections, expectorated saliva had a higher viral load than nasopharyngeal aspirates (nPAs) in 17.0% of patients who tested positive for respiratory viruses by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or influenza A virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in their nPAs.",PMC5520312,PMC5520312_0
"In another study, among patients with a suspected respiratory virus infection but a negative test for respiratory viruses, expectorated saliva should be obtained and evaluated as the specimen type in a diagnostic testing for novel respiratory viruses.",PMC5520312,PMC5520312_1
"The use of saliva alone may not be inferior to the use of nPAs if only a single type of specimen is tested, as the detection rate of respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR in saliva was slightly higher than in nPAs.",PMC5520312,PMC5520312_2
"The collection of expectorated saliva is suitable for patients for whom the collection of nasopharyngeal specimens is contraindicated, such as patients with severe bleeding tendency, as it avoids patient discomfort and reduces the delay in specimen collection.",PMC5520312,PMC5520312_3
"In a study comparing the detection rate of respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR in saliva and nPAs, the sensitivity of the nxtag respiratory pathogen panel used in the second cohort ranged from 71.4% to 100% compared with real-time PCR or RT-PCR, indicating that some patients with respiratory virus infection may be missed even when nPAs and saliva specimens are tested with this multiplex PCR panel.",PMC5520312,PMC5520312_4
