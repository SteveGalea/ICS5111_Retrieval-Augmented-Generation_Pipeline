"The study identified four major clusters of the gii.p17-gii.17 virus, with strains belonging to clusters 1 and 3 containing no unique phenotypic features due to mutations, while strains belonging to clusters 2 and 4 exhibited unique amino acid substitutions in proteins p48, p22, protease, rdrp, and vp2.",PMC6777354,PMC6777354_0
"The study revealed that the gii.p17-gii.17 virus has evolved differently to gii.p4-gii.4, with potential to alter antigenicity, host-binding capability (i.e., hbga), and genome replication efficiency, which could recurrently generate variants of gii.17 with the potential to produce pandemics such as those caused by gii.4 variant strains.",PMC6777354,PMC6777354_1
"The study showed that the gii.p17-gii.17 virus has a lower evolutionary rate than gii.p4, possibly due to differences in replication activities and/or in replication errors of the rdrp protein.",PMC6777354,PMC6777354_2
"The study found that the gii.p17-gii.17 virus contains amino acid substitutions in residues adjacent to the interface between monomers in the rdrp structure, which may affect the stability of the dimer and its rna binding abilities.",PMC6777354,PMC6777354_3
"The study revealed that the gii.p17-gii.17 virus has evolved differently to gii.p4-gii.4, with strains belonging to clusters 1 and 4 having unique amino acid substitutions in rdrp, protease, rdrp, and vp2 proteins, which were found only in miyagi prefecture in japan during short periods and was never detected in other areas, possibly because these mutations are deleterious to the propagations of the virus.",PMC6777354,PMC6777354_4
