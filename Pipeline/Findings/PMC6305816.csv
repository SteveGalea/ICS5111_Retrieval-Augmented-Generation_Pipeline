"The study aimed to construct a positive control based on ar RNA technology using HIV-1 RNA as a model. The researchers cloned the HIV-1 subtype CRF-AD35 sequence into the MS2 genome in the pET32a expression vector in E. Coli DE3 (BL21) strain. The resulting AR RNA was stable after treatment with DNase I and RNase A, similar to previous studies.",PMC6305816,PMC6305816_0
"The AR RNA was assembled in MS2 phage capsid using PEG 6000 and further purified with Sephacryl S-200. The researchers used the TAQMAN method for real-time RT-PCR, which is more specific than dsdNA-binding dye. The study also indicated that the stability of AR RNA in the presence of RNase and durability of AR RNA and naked RNA were similar to previous studies.",PMC6305816,PMC6305816_1
"The researchers prepared a duplicate of the real-time RT-PCR assay, which had a high sensitivity, and the LOD of the channel (FAM) was 101 copies/Âµl of AR RNA, indicating a constantly high amplification efficiency (>99%).",PMC6305816,PMC6305816_2
The study suggested that the stability of AR RNA in the presence of RNase and durability of AR RNA and naked RNA were similar to previous studies. The researchers also compared the stability of AR RNA and naked RNA.,PMC6305816,PMC6305816_3
"The study could serve as a basis for stabilizing other infectious agents due to the high cost of commercial RNA controls based on AR technology, limiting their usage in developed countries. The researchers also developed a virus-based control that requires an accurate analysis and evaluation with a panel of other infectious agents, as well as HIV-1-positive samples. This positive control could be used as a basis for launching an in-house HIV-1 virus assay and could be made readily available to laboratories and HIV research centers.",PMC6305816,PMC6305816_4
