"The prevalence of fiv infection in client-owned cats from western Canada was 5.5%, which is comparable to previous studies in North America, Europe, and Asia but less than those in Turkey, Italy, and Japan.",PMC2822370,PMC2822370_0
"Bite wounds and male sex were significantly associated with fiv positivity, while no significant association was found between fiv positivity and longevity or specific diseases, such as lymph node enlargement and neoplasia.",PMC2822370,PMC2822370_1
"The prevalence of specific clinical signs, such as lethargy and oral diseases, was increased in fiv-positive cats compared to age- and sex-matched randomly selected fiv-negative control cats.",PMC2822370,PMC2822370_2
"The survival time of fiv-positive cats was not significantly affected by fiv infection, although a significant proportion of fiv-positive cats were euthanized, perhaps prematurely.",PMC2822370,PMC2822370_3
"The prevalence and distribution of fiv strains in western Canada warrant further investigation, as most fiv isolates belong to either subtype A or B, and subtype B is less pathogenic than subtype A.",PMC2822370,PMC2822370_4
