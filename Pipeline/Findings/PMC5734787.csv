"In this study, the authors hypothesized that statins regulate cd147 on multiple levels, particularly through isoprenylation and n-glycosylation. They observed that statins inhibited the differentiation of thp-1 cells, indicating that statins interfere with cellular differentiation. They also noted that statins altered the morphology of thp-1 cells, suggesting that statins interfere with cellular differentiation. Additionally, the authors found that statins inhibited the expression of cd147 at both the cell surface and the intracellular compartment, indicating that statins regulate the expression of cd147 through post-translational mechanisms, such as isoprenylation and n-glycosylation, rather than changes at the genomic level.",PMC5734787,PMC5734787_0
"The authors also noted that statins regulate cd147 on multiple levels, particularly through isoprenylation and n-glycosylation, as they observed that statins inhibited the expression of cd147 on both the cell surface and the intracellular compartment. They further observed that statins inhibited the expression of lg forms of cd147, suggesting that statins act on isoprenylation pathways to impair trafficking of cd147 to the cell surface. The authors also noted that statins regulate cd147 through isoprenylation and n-glycosylation, as they observed that two distinct inhibitors of isoprenylation, ftti-277 and ggti-298, only partially inhibited cd147 surface expression and mmp activation, indicating that isoprenylation plays only a minor role in these pathways.",PMC5734787,PMC5734787_1
"The authors also observed that statins regulate cd147 on multiple levels, particularly through isoprenylation and n-glycosylation, as they noted that tunicamycin specifically inhibited the n-glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins, resulting in greatly increased expression of the non-glycosylated core protein.",PMC5734787,PMC5734787_2
