"The study identified two concentration-dependent binding sites for adamantane drugs on m2 ion channels, with binding affinity values differing by approximately three orders of magnitude.",PMC2922235,PMC2922235_0
"Using site-directed mutagenesis, the study mapped the binding sites to the ion channel and a lipid component of the m2 protein complex.",PMC2922235,PMC2922235_1
"The study found that the binding affinity for the lipid component was significantly lower than that for the ion channel component, suggesting that the lipid component may not independently inhibit m2 ion channels.",PMC2922235,PMC2922235_2
"The study also identified an allosteric relationship between the lipid and ion channel components, suggesting that binding at the lipid site may synergistically influence the inhibitory action of the ion channel component.",PMC2922235,PMC2922235_3
The study confirmed the formation of liposomes using dynamic light scattering measurements and electron microscopy images.,PMC2922235,PMC2922235_4
"The study used SPUR, a data analysis program, to format the data for export and to allow for normalization of the data relative to the amount of liposomes bound to the surface.",PMC2922235,PMC2922235_5
"The study found that the dissociation constant for the lipid component was significantly lower than that for the ion channel component, indicating that the lipid component may not independently inhibit m2 ion channels.",PMC2922235,PMC2922235_6
"The study used equilibrium steady-state measurements, using maximal response values during the addition of the drug, to analyze binding experiments.",PMC2922235,PMC2922235_7
"The study found that the lipid component of the m2 protein complex had a significantly lower binding affinity than the ion channel component, suggesting that the lipid component may not independently inhibit m2 ion channels.",PMC2922235,PMC2922235_8
"The study also identified an allosteric relationship between the lipid and ion channel components, suggesting that binding at the lipid site may synergistically influence the inhibitory action of the ion channel component.",PMC2922235,PMC2922235_9
