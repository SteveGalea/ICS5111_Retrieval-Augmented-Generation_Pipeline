"The authors introduce a new reproduction number, RH, which specifically focuses on household-to-household transmission and provides a clear epidemiological interpretation. This is in contrast to the existing clump-to-clump reproduction number, R*, which has a less informative interpretation due to the nonlinearity induced by the local saturation of susceptibles. The authors argue that RH is always informative about how much effort is required to safely contain the epidemic when vaccination is targeted at randomly selected households instead of randomly selected individuals.",PMC2827443,PMC2827443_0
"The authors present a construction similar to that leading to RH, but with a different motivation and derivation. In ball & neal (2002), superimposed to global infections, local infections occur between individuals on a random contact network with specified degree distribution. In the infinite population limit, local saturation can be neglected, and the epidemic behaviour is mainly driven by the household-to-household reproduction number (an average value). On the contrary, already when μHμW is smaller than but close to 1, the time required for a clump to form may be so long that any realistic population size could be too small to make the exponential phase long enough to observe clumps reaching the end of their infectious period before the depletion of susceptibles in the population starts having a major role in the epidemic dynamics.",PMC2827443,PMC2827443_1
"The authors formally prove an inequality (equation (3.3)) for the critical vaccination coverage for households, which provides an upper bound for the effort needed to safely contain the epidemic when vaccination is targeted at randomly selected households instead of randomly selected individuals. They argue that the information provided by both RH and RW should be taken into account and compared, since both parameters should be considered when social distancing control measures are implemented during an infection outbreak.",PMC2827443,PMC2827443_2
"The authors discuss the fact that the presence of workplaces in addition to households allows us to study the effect of the social distancing achieved when people stop going to work. School or workplace closure is not only feasible but also more difficult to study, since it is highly dependent on the time delays between infection, detection of a case, and policy implementation. Real-time estimation methods remain invaluable tools, and much effort should be spent in identifying which data need to be collected and how.",PMC2827443,PMC2827443_3
