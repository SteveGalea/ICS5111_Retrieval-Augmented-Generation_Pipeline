"In the context of glycan refinement using rosetta software, a new method for handling glycan connectivity was developed to overcome the limitations of the standard rosetta carbohydrate framework. This method allows for explicit link record detection, and a scoring term was implemented to assess the energetics of different ring conformations and ensure each sugar adopts the correct anomeric state. These findings are significant because they address the limitations of the standard rosetta carbohydrate framework, which had previously only considered torsion-space refinement of glycans, assuming ideal bond length and bond angle values.",PMC6616339,PMC6616339_0
"In the context of glycan refinement using rosetta software, a ring conformer database was utilized to create a ""rotameric"" ring model. This model identifies the nearest ring ""rotamer"" using torsional rmsd and generates harmonic constraints towards that particular conformation. This finding is significant because it ensures that the correct ring conformations are enforced, particularly in glycans that have only minimal interaction with the protein or other chemical groups.",PMC6616339,PMC6616339_1
"In the context of glycan refinement using rosetta software, protocols were developed to refine glycoproteins in both sparse cryo-electron microscopy data and crystallography data. These protocols utilized the rosetta software package, which is freely available for academic users, and used the rosettaScripts syntax to describe protocols implemented in rosetta. The scripts used for both protocols are included in the rosetta source, and will be kept up to date.",PMC6616339,PMC6616339_2
"In the context of glycan refinement using rosetta software, privateer was utilized to report mismatches between the name and conformation of the structure as well as high energy conformational states of the sugars. This finding is significant because it allows for anomalies in glycoprotein structures to be assessed and quantified.",PMC6616339,PMC6616339_3
"In the context of glycan refinement using rosetta software, phenix was used to create polder omit maps and calculate the real space correlation to the glycans in both these maps and the 2mfo-dfc density map. This finding is significant because it allows for a detailed analysis of the glycan structures in both these maps and the density map.",PMC6616339,PMC6616339_4
