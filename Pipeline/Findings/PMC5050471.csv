"Alisporivir, a drug used to treat hepatitis C virus infection, has modest effects on the replication of Ebola virus strains.",PMC5050471,PMC5050471_0
Replication of Ebola virus-Mayinga (1976) is only reduced by a maximum of 10 micrograms per milliliter of alisporivir at 10 micrograms per milliliter.,PMC5050471,PMC5050471_1
Replication of Ebola virus-Makona (Gulu 2014) is significantly inhibited by 10 micrograms per milliliter of alisporivir.,PMC5050471,PMC5050471_2
"Alisporivir has a greater antiviral effect on tick-borne flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus, Tick-Borne Encephalitis virus, Kyasanur Forest Disease virus, and Powassan virus, with a 1 log10 reduction in virus titers observed at 0.5 micrograms per milliliter of alisporivir.",PMC5050471,PMC5050471_3
"The susceptibility of Ebola virus to alisporivir is less than that of tick-borne flaviviruses, suggesting that reduced cell viability at high concentrations of alisporivir does not significantly influence virus replication.",PMC5050471,PMC5050471_4
