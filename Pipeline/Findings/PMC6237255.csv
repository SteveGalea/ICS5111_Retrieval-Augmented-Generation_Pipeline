"The study compared the efficacy of commercially available vaccines used in a heterologous prime-boost protocol of immunization under field-like conditions, including a challenge of immunity, in domestic animals.",PMC6237255,PMC6237255_0
"The study found that the inactivated immunogen engendered better clinical immunity, including relevant anamnestic antibody responses, subsequent to virulent challenge with brsv, compared to a representative, commonly used parenteral combination viral mlv vaccine.",PMC6237255,PMC6237255_1
"The study demonstrated that boosting of already primed (secondary) responses by parenteral mlv vaccines used at a time when commonly administered in the field, at approximately 2 months of age, can also be partially blocked by residual maternal antibodies in calves with good passive transfer.",PMC6237255,PMC6237255_2
The study suggested that inhibition or blocking of primary antibody responses by maternal antibodies is a well-documented phenomenon of neonatal immunology and is a major consideration for vaccine choice and administration to young animals.,PMC6237255,PMC6237255_3
"The study highlighted the need for more comparative information regarding the boosting of neonatally primed responses, which have a relatively short duration of immunity, when representative, commonly used parenteral combination viral mlv and inactivated vaccines are administered as boosters at the traditional time of handling of calves for a first vaccination, around 2 months of age in a commercial beef operation, overall.",PMC6237255,PMC6237255_4
