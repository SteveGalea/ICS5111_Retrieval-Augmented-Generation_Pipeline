"A study in China has reported the first detection of porcine torovirus (ptov) in swine with diarrhea, and molecular epidemiology was conducted. Ptov was detected in 9 out of 20 farms, with two farms testing positive for ptov alone, suggesting the possibility of individual animal infection.",PMC3891532,PMC3891532_0
"Sequence analysis confirmed that the Chinese ptov strains were closely related to each other and to the European and Spanish strains, indicating that different ptov strains can circulate simultaneously in an area.",PMC3891532,PMC3891532_1
"High incidence of ptov infection was observed in swine with diarrhea, and two diarrhea samples were tested positive for ptov alone, as reported in a previous study.",PMC3891532,PMC3891532_2
The study suggests the need for further studies to reveal the epidemiological status of ptov infection in China and to develop an immunological method to detect serological prevalence of porcine torovirus in Chinese swine herds.,PMC3891532,PMC3891532_3
"The study highlights the importance of including ptov examination in the diagnosis of porcine diarrhea, as the impossibility of growing the virus in culture cells has precluded the development of ptov diagnostics.",PMC3891532,PMC3891532_4
