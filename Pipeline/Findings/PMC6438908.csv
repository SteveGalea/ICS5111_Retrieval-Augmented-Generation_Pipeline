"This study reports for the first time the prevalence of Enterocytozoon bieneusi (E. Bieneusi) in peafowl (Pavo cristatus) in China, with an infection rate of 6.59%.",PMC6438908,PMC6438908_0
"The study also reports for the first time the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. In peafowl in China, with infection rates of 4.58% and 9.52% in peafowl from Beijing and Jiangxi province, respectively.",PMC6438908,PMC6438908_1
"Three genotypes of E. Bieneusi were identified, including two known genotypes (peru6 and d) and one novel genotype (jxp1), with genotype d being predominant in peafowl from Beijing.",PMC6438908,PMC6438908_2
"The study confirmed the presence of two known avian adapted genotypes of Cryptosporidium spp., avian genotype iii and goose genotype i, in peafowl, with avian genotype iii being found in peafowl from Beijing and goose genotype i being found in peafowl from Jiangxi province.",PMC6438908,PMC6438908_3
"The study highlights the importance of peafowl as potential sources of human and animal microsporidiosis, as both E. Bieneusi genotype peru6 and d, and the novel genotype jxp1, as well as Cryptosporidium avian genotype iii and goose genotype i, belong to human-pathogenic groups.",PMC6438908,PMC6438908_4
