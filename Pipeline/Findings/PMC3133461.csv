"The study identified several HIV-1-specific human IgM-derived mAbs and their highly conserved epitopes, which have not been extensively investigated and reported.",PMC3133461,PMC3133461_0
"These antibodies and their epitopes were characterized, which could provide insights into immune responses to HIV-1 and aid in the design of candidate vaccine immunogens that elicit potent neutralizers of early transmitted viruses.",PMC3133461,PMC3133461_1
"The study found that the majority, if not all, binding activities of the selected antibodies should be contributed by the conventional antigen-antibody recognition, and not by the single-chain fusion proteins or the heavy chain-shuffling fab library.",PMC3133461,PMC3133461_2
"The study reported that the epitopes of two of the antibodies (m19 and m19b) were mapped to a structure in very close proximity to the CD4bs and CCR5s, which suggests their potential role in HIV-1 pathogenesis.",PMC3133461,PMC3133461_3
"The study revealed that the antibodies identified had relative infectivity (%) calculated by the following formula: (average rlu of antibody-containing wells/average rlu of virus-only wells) Ã— 100, which could be a useful tool in the design and evaluation of candidate vaccine immunogens.",PMC3133461,PMC3133461_4
