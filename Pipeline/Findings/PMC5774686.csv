"D) The use of amantadine in hospitalized patients remained relatively stable after 2003, with increases observed during the SARS epidemic in 2003, the 2004-05 winter with the new A(H3N2) strain, and during the 2009-10 pandemic with the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. E) The study found that oseltamivir usage in hospitalized patients approximates the estimated occurrence of influenza-associated respiratory hospitalizations in older adults, but is lower than the estimated occurrence of influenza-associated respiratory hospitalizations in children.",PMC5774686,PMC5774686_1
