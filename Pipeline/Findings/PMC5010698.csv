"Study used next generation sequencing to compare genomes of 26 clinical and vaccine isolates of fhv-1, revealing a low level of genetic diversity (0.0-0.01%) between isolates.",PMC5010698,PMC5010698_0
"No potential genetic determinants of virulence were identified, but unique SNPs in ul28 and ul44 genes were found in vaccine isolates that were not present in clinical isolates.",PMC5010698,PMC5010698_1
"No evidence of fhv-1 recombination was detected, despite many isolates originating from cats in a shelter environment with high infective pressures.",PMC5010698,PMC5010698_2
Displacement of dominant fhv-1 isolates with other genetically distinct isolates over time was observed among isolates obtained from shelter-housed animals.,PMC5010698,PMC5010698_3
SNPs detected only in vaccine isolates offer the potential to develop PCR-based methods for differentiating vaccine and clinical isolates of fhv-1 in future epidemiological studies.,PMC5010698,PMC5010698_4
