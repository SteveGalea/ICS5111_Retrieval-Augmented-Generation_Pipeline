"The study found that a highly conserved part of the var2csa dbl-4ε domain, targeting all var2csa genes without bias, was quantified using a rotorgene thermal cycler system and a primer set specific for this domain.",PMC2779471,PMC2779471_0
The study produced recombinant var2csa dbl3-x constructs from 29 genotypically distinct P. Falciparum isolates and tested them in ELISA.,PMC2779471,PMC2779471_1
"The study cloned and expressed a chimeric construct composed of 5' 3d7-var2csa dbl3-x and 3' fcr3-var2csa dbl3-x, with an EcoRI site and a notI site, in a modified PacGp67-A vector and expressed it in insect cells.",PMC2779471,PMC2779471_2
The study tested ELISA vsapam-reactive monoclonal IgG-containing supernatants for reactivity with the recombinant var2csa proteins produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells.,PMC2779471,PMC2779471_3
The study produced recombinant var2csa dbl3-x constructs from P. Falciparum isolates ej24 and ej27 using a Rotorgene thermal cycler system and a primer set specific for a highly conserved part of the var2csa dbl-4ε domain.,PMC2779471,PMC2779471_4
