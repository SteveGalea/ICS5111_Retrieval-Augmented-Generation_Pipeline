"In a study involving macedonian and british patients with hypouricaemia, mutational analysis of the uric acid transporter gene, slc22a12, revealed the presence of missense mutations in the gene associated with a persistent hypouricaemia. Functional expression studies using a mammalian cell expression system showed that the mutations resulted in a significant decrease in uric acid transport function.",PMC3241677,PMC3241677_0
"In the same study, mutational analysis of slc22a12 and slc2a9 genes in macedonian and british patients with hypouricaemia revealed the presence of heterozygous missense mutations in both genes in some patients. These mutations were associated with a significant decrease in uric acid transport function in functional expression studies using a mammalian cell expression system.",PMC3241677,PMC3241677_1
The study also found that a heterozygous missense mutation in slc22a12 (p.R57C) was associated with a significant decrease in uric acid transport function in functional expression studies using a mammalian cell expression system.,PMC3241677,PMC3241677_2
"In the same study, a heterozygous missense mutation in slc22a12 (p.R58C) was identified in a british patient with hypouricaemia and was associated with a significant decrease in uric acid transport function in functional expression studies using a mammalian cell expression system.",PMC3241677,PMC3241677_3
The study also found that a heterozygous missense mutation in slc22a12 (p.R57C) was associated with a significant decrease in uric acid transport function in functional expression studies using a mammalian cell expression system in a british patient with hypouricaemia.,PMC3241677,PMC3241677_4
