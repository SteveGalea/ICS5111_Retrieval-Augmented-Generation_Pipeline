The study successfully isolated and characterized the PDCoV CHN-JS-2017 strain in cultured cells and demonstrated its pathogenicity in piglets.,PMC7019308,PMC7019308_0
The study found that the expression of fcrn and pigr in the intestinal mucosa of infected piglets is down-regulated by NF-κB and positively correlated with each other in infected piglets.,PMC7019308,PMC7019308_1
"The study revealed that the prevalence of PDCoV in pigs is high in certain provinces in China, with a success rate of isolation in cultured cells being relatively low.",PMC7019308,PMC7019308_2
The study suggests that PDCoV causes severe diarrhea and vomiting in piglets aged 5-21 days and that viral fecal shedding can be detected through real-time PCR in fecal swabs from challenged piglets.,PMC7019308,PMC7019308_3
"The study provides insights into the immune escape strategy of PDCoV, as it significantly down-regulated fcrn and pigr expression by NF-κB and reduces the ability of fcrn and pigr to transport PDCoV-specific IgG and IgA across the mucosal epithelium, resulting in impaired intestinal immunity in the mucosa and reducing the host’s anti-infection ability.",PMC7019308,PMC7019308_4
