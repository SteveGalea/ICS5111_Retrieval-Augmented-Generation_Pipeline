"Endosymbiosis, the uptake of bacteria by eukaryotic cells, led to the evolution of organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts through gene transfer and loss. This process involves the reduction in genome size and the acquisition of essential metabolic functions from the host cell.",PMC6433886,PMC6433886_0
"Retroviruses, which are capable of integrating into the host genome, can contribute to genetic complexity through gene transfer and the acquisition of functional elements. They have also been proposed to have a role in the evolution of cells through gene loss and gain.",PMC6433886,PMC6433886_1
"Viruses, including retroviruses, are not only pathogens but also major drivers of evolution through the transmission of genetic material and the promotion of innovation. They can cause disease when environmental conditions change, but the majority of viruses do not cause harm.",PMC6433886,PMC6433886_2
"The concept of evolution through large changes, such as endosymbiosis or pathogen infections, is gaining recognition as a basis for evolutionary theory. This is in contrast to the traditional view of evolution through gradual changes by mutations.",PMC6433886,PMC6433886_3
"The contribution of viruses to the evolution of life since at least 550 million years ago is supported by numerous examples, including the origin of life, the evolution of cells, and the promotion of innovation. However, the question of whether viruses are our oldest ancestors remains a subject of debate.",PMC6433886,PMC6433886_4
