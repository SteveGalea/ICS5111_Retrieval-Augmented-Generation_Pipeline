"In a study on the conformational space of the transmembrane domain of coronavirus protein e, a dimeric, a trimeric, and two pentameric homooligomers have been conserved in all 13 sequences analyzed, indicating that these models have been conserved by chance. This is supported by the low similarity between these sequences, as low as 17%, and by the relative energies of the resulting models, as the lowest energy models for each sequence cluster around the conformation of the persistent model.",PMC1305130,PMC1305130_0
"A systematic search for homooligomers of coronavirus protein e has revealed that dimeric, trimeric, and pentameric homooligomers can form in sds micelles. This is consistent with previous in vivo studies that showed dimers and trimers in nonreducing conditions, but only monomers in reducing conditions.",PMC1305130,PMC1305130_1
"The study suggests that the specificity in the interactions between monomers resides in the transmembrane domain of protein e, but a dramatic effect on oligomerization is contributed by the extramembrane domain, specifically, but possibly not limited to, intermonomer disulfide bonds.",PMC1305130,PMC1305130_2
"The predicted pentameric bundle or pore could represent open and closed states of a channel, as both conformations should have been equally conserved during evolution. This is intriguing as recent in vivo studies on the whole protein have shown membrane permeabilizing activity of scove, and the reported membrane permeabilizing activity of scove is consistent with the prediction of a pentameric bundle or pore.",PMC1305130,PMC1305130_3
"The study supports a topology for protein e where n- and c-termini are in opposite sides of the membrane, as both n- and c-termini of the protein would reside in the inside of the virion envelope. This is consistent with previous studies that showed that protein e was not digested after treating mhv particles with proteinase k in the absence of detergent and that protein e was palmitoylated, as physical interaction of this domain with the m protein is critical in the formation of the virion.",PMC1305130,PMC1305130_4
"The study proposes that palmitoylation and the subsequent close association of the cytoplasmic tail to the lipid bilayer may trigger conformational changes critical for function, as",PMC1305130,PMC1305130_5
