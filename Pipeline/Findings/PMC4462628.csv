"The study found that the cysteine protease cathepsin W (CTSW) is required for the fusion of the influenza A virus (IAV) with host cells. This was shown through several experiments, including the observation that IAV entry into cells was reduced by 90% in the presence of the CTSW inhibitor E64, and that IAV fusion with host cells was significantly impaired in cells lacking CTSW expression.",PMC4462628,PMC4462628_0
"The study also found that CTSW is essential for the fusion of IAV strains with a high fusion phenotype, but not for another late fusing virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).",PMC4462628,PMC4462628_1
"The study showed that CTSW is required for the entrapment of IAV nucleoprotein (NP) in late endosomes, as the NP was found to be trapped in late endosomes in the presence of CTSW inhibitor or CTSW knockdown, but not in the presence of CTSW overexpression.",PMC4462628,PMC4462628_2
"The study found that CTSW overexpression did not affect IAV replication, as shown by the determination of viral titers in cells stably expressing CTSW or CTSW(C153A) and infected with IAV.",PMC4462628,PMC4462628_3
"The study also demonstrated that CTSW is required for the maturation of IAV in late endosomes, as the IAV HA0 and HA1 proteins were found to be processed in the presence of CTSW inhibitor or CTSW knockdown, but not in the presence of CTSW overexpression.",PMC4462628,PMC4462628_4
"The study further showed that CTSW is essential for the maturation of IAV HA2 and HA3 proteins, as the HA2 and HA3 bands were not observed in the presence of CTSW inhibitor or CTSW knockdown, but were present in the presence of CTSW overexpression.",PMC4462628,PMC4462628_5
"The study found that CTSW-overexpressing cells were more susceptible to IAV infection, as shown by the observation that IAV entry into cells was increased by 200% in the presence of CTSW overexpression.",PMC4462628,PMC4462628_6
The study also revealed that the CTSW inhibitor E64 did not affect the entry of I,PMC4462628,PMC4462628_7
