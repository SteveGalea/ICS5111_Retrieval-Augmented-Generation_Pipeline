"High treatment costs accelerate the spread of infectious diseases, making it difficult to control their spread. This is particularly evident in the case of high-cost treatments, where the number of infected people remains high, even after a large number of simulation runs.",PMC7036499,PMC7036499_0
"Low treatment costs, on the other hand, make it easier to control the spread of infectious diseases, as evidenced by the fact that the number of infected people falls rapidly, and the epidemic can be controlled in a relatively short period of time.",PMC7036499,PMC7036499_1
"When treatment costs are high, government intervention is critical in controlling the spread of infectious diseases, as shown by the fact that the number of infected people remains high, even after a large number of simulation runs, but drops rapidly with government intervention.",PMC7036499,PMC7036499_2
"The higher the treatment costs, the more important government intervention becomes in controlling the spread of infectious diseases.",PMC7036499,PMC7036499_3
"The study suggests that full government subsidy for infectious diseases under high treatment costs is successful, as shown by the fact that the number of infected people drops rapidly and falls to zero in a relatively short period of time.",PMC7036499,PMC7036499_4
"The study also highlights the importance of government intervention in controlling emerging infectious diseases, as uncertainty in medical expenditures about these diseases is high, and complete reimbursement policies should be established to control them.",PMC7036499,PMC7036499_5
"The study provides theoretical support for controlling big infectious diseases, as it shows that high treatment costs accelerate the spread of infectious diseases and that government intervention becomes more critical as treatment costs increase.",PMC7036499,PMC7036499_6
The study suggests that predicting infectious diseases using learning and big data may be the subject of future study.,PMC7036499,PMC7036499_7
"The study also notes that without government reimbursement, high treatment costs accelerate the spread of infectious diseases, as evidenced by the fact that the proportion of infected people remains high, even after a large number of simulation runs.",PMC7036499,PMC7036499_8
"The study highlights the importance of government intervention in controlling emerging infectious diseases, as shown by the fact that predicting infectious diseases using learning and big data may yield high treatment expenditures, and complete reimbursement policies should be established to control these diseases.",PMC7036499,PMC7036499_9
