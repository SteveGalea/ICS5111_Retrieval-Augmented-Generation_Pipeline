"The functional snps of fcγriia and fcγriib are associated with atopy, indicating that these receptors play important roles in the development of allergy.",PMC3931680,PMC3931680_0
"The functional fcγriia-131his>arg snp is associated with protection against atopy, possibly due to the increased capacity of this allele to efficiently internalize and destroy allergen-igg2 immune complexes.",PMC3931680,PMC3931680_1
"The low function fcγriib-187thr allele is associated with elevated ige levels and is a risk factor for atopy, possibly due to the decreased activation threshold for immune cells carrying this allele.",PMC3931680,PMC3931680_2
"The dysfunctional fcγriib-187thr allele is associated with an exacerbated lung inflammation, possibly due to an important regulatory role for fcγriib in the onset of allergic diseases.",PMC3931680,PMC3931680_3
"The study had more than 80% power to detect an association between a fcgr snp and atopy with an or of 1.75, indicating the importance of targeting fcγriia and fcγriib for enhanced receptor expressions and functions in allergy and asthma treatment.",PMC3931680,PMC3931680_4
