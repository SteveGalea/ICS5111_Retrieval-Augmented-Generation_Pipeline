"The multicode-plx system, a massively multiplexed nucleic acid detection method, has been developed and tested for the comprehensive detection of 17 respiratory viruses in clinical samples.",PMC2045250,PMC2045250_0
"The system incorporates both DNA and RNA targets in each sample, with each target being detected by two different color-coded fluoroprobes.",PMC2045250,PMC2045250_1
"The system is capable of distinguishing between antigenic subgroups a and b of human rhinovirus and human coronavirus NL63, as well as antigenic subgroups a and b of human respiratory syncytial virus.",PMC2045250,PMC2045250_2
"The diagnostic yield of the multicode-plx system, when compared with conventional methods for the detection of respiratory viruses, was increased for enteroviruses, human respiratory syncytial viruses, and human coronaviruses NL63.",PMC2045250,PMC2045250_3
"The multicode-plx system is feasible for use by clinical laboratories and provides a rapid, sensitive, and comprehensive approach to the molecular detection of respiratory viruses, with each sample requiring approximately 4 minutes of hands-on time.",PMC2045250,PMC2045250_4
