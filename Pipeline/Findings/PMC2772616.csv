The study found that nasopharyngeal sampling is superior to oropharyngeal sampling and that nasopharyngeal sampling with a rigid cotton swab and the use of nasopharyngeal washing are both more sensitive than oropharyngeal sampling for the identification of respiratory viruses in adults.,PMC2772616,PMC2772616_0
The study also found that the use of nasopharyngeal washing and nasopharyngeal sampling with a rigid cotton swab in combination with oropharyngeal sampling or nasopharyngeal sampling with a rigid cotton swab in combination with oropharyngeal sampling and nasopharyngeal washing resulted in maximal sensitivity rates for the identification of all viruses tested.,PMC2772616,PMC2772616_1
The study found that the use of nasopharyngeal washing resulted in higher rates of sensitivity than the use of nasopharyngeal sampling with a rigid cotton swab for the identification of respiratory viruses in adults.,PMC2772616,PMC2772616_2
"The study found that the use of nasopharyngeal washing resulted in higher rates of sensitivity for the identification of respiratory viruses than the use of oropharyngeal sampling for all common virus groups, as well as for influenza viruses in previous studies with adult and mixed adult-pediatric populations.",PMC2772616,PMC2772616_3
"The study found that the use of nasopharyngeal washing and nasopharyngeal sampling with a rigid cotton swab resulted in similar rates of sensitivity for the identification of rsv in adults, as found in two studies limited to pediatric populations in which npss and npws were compared.",PMC2772616,PMC2772616_4
