"In the context of pandemic influenza, the study found that travel restrictions can delay the spread of the disease between cities by several weeks, but this delay is highly sensitive to assumptions about the transmissibility of the influenza virus and demographic factors such as city sizes, travel rates, and the origin of travelers.",PMC2878213,PMC2878213_0
"The study suggests that travel restrictions could have a greater effect in more isolated communities that lack international ports, as these communities may have lower effective values of the reproduction number and shorter average times between infections.",PMC2878213,PMC2878213_1
"The study found that moderate delays in the pandemic could be achievable when the epidemic growth rate is low, but if the estimated growth rate is high, the additional median delay between 20 cases occurring in city 1 and 20 cases occurring in city 2 might be just 3 days, providing little benefit from longer term implementation of travel restrictions.",PMC2878213,PMC2878213_2
"The study found that travel restrictions would be most applicable for extended use in the protection of small, relatively isolated centers due to the strong influence of epidemic growth rates and demographic factors such as city sizes, travel rates, and the origin of travelers on delays induced by internal border control.",PMC2878213,PMC2878213_3
"The study highlights that travel restrictions would be ineffective if frequent importations are not considered, as this could greatly reduce the benefits of internal restrictions for cities with international airports or ports.",PMC2878213,PMC2878213_4
