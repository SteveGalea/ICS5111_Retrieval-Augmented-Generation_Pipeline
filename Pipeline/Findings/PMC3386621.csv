"PrRSV activates the transcription of type I interferon in porcine alveolar macrophages, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells.",PMC3386621,PMC3386621_0
"PrRSV inhibits the translation of type I interferon in these cells partly through cytopathogenicity, as UV- and heat-inactivated viruses lose their ability to interfere with type I interferon induction by porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus or poly IC.",PMC3386621,PMC3386621_1
"PrRSV inhibits the nuclear translocation of IRF-3 by inactivating ips-1, a downstream molecule of the RIG-I pathway, in Marc-145 cells.",PMC3386621,PMC3386621_2
"PrRSV activates the transcription of type I interferon in Marc-145 cells but fails to activate the transcription of interferon-α and β in alveolar macrophages, suggesting cell type-dependent differences in activating the transcription of type I interferon by PrRSV.",PMC3386621,PMC3386621_3
"PrRSV inhibits or reduces the induction of type I interferon, which makes the translation repressor, 4E-BP1, hyperactive and reduces global protein synthesis by inhibiting the PI3K-dependent Akt pathway during late infection.",PMC3386621,PMC3386621_4
