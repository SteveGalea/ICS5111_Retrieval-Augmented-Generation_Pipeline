"Prrsv gp3 protein is posttranslationally modified with complex-type glycosylation, resulting in a smear pattern with a molecular mass greater than that of the intracellular gp3.",PMC109768,PMC109768_0
Prrsv gp3 is released from the cell as a membrane-free form and acquires additional carbohydrate side chains in the medial golgi compartment.,PMC109768,PMC109768_1
"Prrsv gp3 occurs in a disulfide-linked homodimer, which is selectively retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and is not detected in cell lysates but is revealed only in the culture fluids of infected cells.",PMC109768,PMC109768_2
"Prrsv gp3 is released from infected cells through a vesicular transport pathway involving the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus, and this process is affected by inhibitors of protein transport and glycosylation.",PMC109768,PMC109768_3
"Prrsv gp3 is released from infected cells at a rate that is dependent on its posttranslational modifications, and a small fraction of the nonglycosylated protein can be recovered in cells expressing gp3 in the presence of inhibitors of protein glycosylation.",PMC109768,PMC109768_4
