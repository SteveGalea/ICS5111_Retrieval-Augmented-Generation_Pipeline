The study presents the structure of the Ebola virus glycoprotein spike within the virion envelope at a resolution of 11 Å. This finding is important as it provides insight into the organization and composition of the virus that causes the deadly Ebola disease.,PMC5387728,PMC5387728_0
"The study found that the mucin-like domain occludes the glycan cap and receptor-binding region, such that cleavage is required for the functioning of the latter in the endosome to reveal the receptor-binding site on gp1. This finding is important as it sheds light on the mechanism by which the virus is able to infect and spread through the body.",PMC5387728,PMC5387728_1
"The study used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single particle analysis to investigate the spatial arrangement and periodicity of the different layers including the spikes, viral envelope, and nucleocapsid. This finding is important as it provides a better understanding of the organization and composition of the virus at a higher resolution.",PMC5387728,PMC5387728_2
"The study found that the use of a ""t""-shaped mask in image processing for the 3-D projection matching of the Ebola virus spike images allowed for the selection of image regions containing both the lipid bilayer and a single spike. This finding is important as it facilitates the analysis of specific regions of interest within the virus.",PMC5387728,PMC5387728_3
"The study found that the structure of the Ebola virus glycoprotein spike within the virion envelope at a resolution of 11 Å is consistent with the mucin-like domain partially occluding the glycan cap and receptor-binding region, such that cleavage is required for the functioning of the latter in the endosome to reveal the receptor-binding site on gp1. This finding reinforces the importance of understanding the mechanism by which the virus is able to infect and spread through the body.",PMC5387728,PMC5387728_4
