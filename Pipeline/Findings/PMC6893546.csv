"A new species of merbecovirus, ea-hedcov hku31, has been discovered in hedgehogs from China, with a genome sequence similarity of 79.6% to that of betacoronavirus erinaceus/vmc/deu/2012 and 68.4% to that of mers-cov.",PMC6893546,PMC6893546_0
"Ea-hedcov hku31 and betacoronavirus erinaceus/vmc/deu/2012 represent a distinct clade among merbecovirus, with a potential for recombination with other bat covs in merbecovirus, including neocov and batcov predict/pdf-2018.",PMC6893546,PMC6893546_1
"The spike protein of ea-hedcov hku31 contains three deletions in the predicted s1-rbd when compared to the mers-cov spike protein, with only one of the 12 critical residues being conserved for mers-rbd to hdpp4 binding. Structural modelling also predicted low homology between mers-rbd and hku31-rbd in the rbd-hdpp4 interphase, suggesting that the ea-hedcov hku31 spike protein may not be able to bind and utilize hdpp4 as receptor.",PMC6893546,PMC6893546_2
"Pseudovirus assays with different host receptors may allow scientists to further investigate the cell entry mechanism of these hedgehog viruses, as the receptor utilized by this virus remains unknown.",PMC6893546,PMC6893546_3
"According to molecular dating studies, the divergence time of mers-covs was estimated as approximately 2009 to 2011, with the tmrca of mers-covs dated to approximately 2009, that of hedgehog covs dated to approximately 1913, and that of all members of merbecovirus dated to approximately 1580. This indicates that the hedgehog viruses may have only emerged a century ago and the recombinant ancestor of neocov and related viruses no earlier. Further evolutionary studies on merbecovirus may help understand this rapidly evolving group of covs with emergence potential.",PMC6893546,PMC6893546_4
