"SARS-CoV is an inefficient inducer of interferon beta (IFN-β), which prevents early activation of the innate immune system and may contribute to its highly pathogenic potential.",PMC546554,PMC546554_0
"SARS-CoV interferes with the molecular step that precedes and occurs independently of subsequent hyperphosphorylation and dimerization of activated interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), preventing the recruitment of the nuclear protein CBP and the subsequent activation of IFN-β gene.",PMC546554,PMC546554_1
"SARS-CoV appears to avoid transcription of the IFN-β gene by allowing the first step but blocking the subsequent ones, as irF-3 can localize to the nucleus in the absence of CBP binding, and stable nuclear localization correlates with hyperphosphorylation, homodimerization, and CBP binding.",PMC546554,PMC546554_2
"SARS-CoV blocks the IFN-β gene transcription by specifically interfering with IRF-3 function to prevent activation of the innate immune system, which may contribute to the highly pathogenic potential of the virus.",PMC546554,PMC546554_3
"SARS-CoV has the ability to counteract the IFN system, which prevents early activation of the innate immune system, and may contribute to its highly pathogenic potential, as most probably, it blocks a molecular step that is situated between the nuclear transport of IRF-3 and its subsequent activation by hyperphosphorylation and dimerization, preventing the recruitment of the nuclear protein CBP.",PMC546554,PMC546554_4
