"The grna of (+)ssrna viruses is not packaged by chance, but rather by a specific set of factors that are specific to each virus.",PMC6466141,PMC6466141_0
The ability of an rna to be replicated by the rdrp is a key factor that determines if this molecule can be packaged.,PMC6466141,PMC6466141_1
"In some viruses, the presence of a packaging signal (ps) is not sufficient to explain selective packaging, as the ability of the rna to be replicated is also involved.",PMC6466141,PMC6466141_2
"Other characteristics that may determine how an rna is packaged include whether rna replication produces other rna species aside from the grna, the length and number of packaged molecules, and the nature of the host cell.",PMC6466141,PMC6466141_3
The molecular mechanism that controls selective packaging in (+)ssrna viruses is very complex and depends on a series of interactions and characteristics that are specific to each species.,PMC6466141,PMC6466141_4
"There are instances in which some of these characteristics can be shared among viruses that belong to the same genus or family, or even between unrelated viruses.",PMC6466141,PMC6466141_5
The specific details of these molecular mechanisms can differ greatly even between species that are evolutionarily very close to each other.,PMC6466141,PMC6466141_6
Viruses can solve the same problem by using very different solutions.,PMC6466141,PMC6466141_7
The lack of knowledge of all the interactions that control packaging of the grna has led us to neglect this process as a possible target for antiviral therapies.,PMC6466141,PMC6466141_8
Only a deep and comprehensive understanding of the similarities and differences between these processes among different viruses will allow us to develop novel therapies aimed at one of the most crucial steps of the viral infectious cycle.,PMC6466141,PMC6466141_9
