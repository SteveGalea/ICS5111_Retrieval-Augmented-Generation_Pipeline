"The study utilized a novel method, egfr multipeptide array, to detect EGFR autoantibodies in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as in breast and pancreatic cancer. This technique allows for not only the detection of EGFR autoantibodies but also the identification of their corresponding epitopes, which has not been previously reported in the literature.",PMC6000384,PMC6000384_0
"The study found that EGFR autoantibodies are present in the blood of a significant proportion (approximately 80%) of NSCLC patients, with the majority in the advanced stages of the disease. This highlights the need for a non-invasive early-stage NSCLC diagnostic method.",PMC6000384,PMC6000384_1
"The study showed that EGFR overexpression, a well-established feature of NSCLC, is associated with the survival of NSCLC, breast, and pancreatic cancer cells. This finding suggests that EGFR overexpression provides a survival signal to cancer cells, preventing apoptosis.",PMC6000384,PMC6000384_2
"The study detected EGFR autoantibodies in the blood of patients with breast, pancreatic, and NSCLC cancers. This finding is significant as it expands the scope of EGFR autoantibody research beyond NSCLC.",PMC6000384,PMC6000384_3
"The study identified high-frequency epitopes in the extracellular domain of EGFR in NSCLC patients. These epitopes are likely to be involved in the regulation of EGFR signaling pathways, which may contribute to NSCLC progression.",PMC6000384,PMC6000384_4
