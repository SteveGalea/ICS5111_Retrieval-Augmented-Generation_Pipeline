"A study found that case fatality rates of SARS increased with air pollution levels in Chinese populations, with short-term exposure to moderate levels of air pollution increasing the risk of death by 84%, and long-term exposure increasing the risk by 1.71 and 2.26 times, respectively.",PMC293432,PMC293432_0
"The study suggests that long-term and short-term exposure to air pollution may compromise lung function, leading to increased risk of death from SARS.",PMC293432,PMC293432_1
"Both short-term and long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM10) has been associated with adverse health effects, including acute respiratory inflammation, asthma, and COPD.",PMC293432,PMC293432_2
"The study's limitations include ecologic fallacy, uneven application of dangerous therapy, and imprecise measurements of air pollution.",PMC293432,PMC293432_3
The study's findings suggest that further investigation is required to fully understand the relationship between air pollution and SARS case fatality in Chinese populations.,PMC293432,PMC293432_4
