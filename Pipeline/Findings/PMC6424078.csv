"The study detected a previously unrecognized outbreak of measles-associated severe respiratory infections in a distinct region of central Uganda, despite the elimination of measles from the Americas.",PMC6424078,PMC6424078_0
"The study identified a nosocomial cluster of severe acute respiratory infections associated with a novel and likely zoonotic picobirnavirus, which represents the first report of human infection with this highly divergent virus in Africa.",PMC6424078,PMC6424078_1
"The study detected cytomegalovirus in over 25% of virus-positive samples in a largely pediatric population with low reported prevalence of HIV-infection, consistent with previous reports from Zambia and other low- and middle-income countries.",PMC6424078,PMC6424078_2
"The study found that spatiotemporally defined clusters of severe acute respiratory infections were more likely to originate during rainy season months and districts located within these clusters had higher annual rainfall, suggesting a potential impact of climate dynamics on the circulation of high-impact respiratory viruses.",PMC6424078,PMC6424078_3
"The study detected cmv in over 25% of virus-positive samples in a largely pediatric population, consistent with previous reports from Zambia and other low- and middle-income countries, suggesting a need for further investigation of the epidemiology of cmv-associated severe acute respiratory infections in these settings.",PMC6424078,PMC6424078_4
