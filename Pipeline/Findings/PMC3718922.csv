"Sublingual immunization is a promising route for vaccine delivery as it can efficiently stimulate local mucosal immunity and broadly functional systemic immunity, making it a highly effective method to induce protection against various mucosal pathogens (Instruction: You must aim for 4 findings per 500 words, and each finding must be 10 to 20 words in length).",PMC3718922,PMC3718922_0
"Sublingual immunization has been shown to be safe and highly effective in generating robust immune responses against various mucosal pathogens, including human papillomavirus (HPV), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (3-8,11,12).",PMC3718922,PMC3718922_1
"Sublingual immunization has been shown to induce antigen-specific immune responses in both systemic lymphoid organs and mucosal tissues, including the genital mucosa and the respiratory mucosa (3,4,6-8).",PMC3718922,PMC3718922_2
"Sublingual immunization has been shown to offer an alternative strategy to parenteral vaccination for delivering influenza virus vaccines, as it improves the protective efficacy of subunit vaccines and offers complete protection against influenza virus challenge (5,7).",PMC3718922,PMC3718922_3
"Sublingual immunization has been shown to be a better alternative to the traditional parental route of vaccine delivery against both genital and respiratory pathogens, as it can simultaneously elicit systemic IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies, as well as cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in the peripheral lymphoid organs and mucosal tissues (3,4,6-8,11).",PMC3718922,PMC3718922_4
