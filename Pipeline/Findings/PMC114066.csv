"Ebola virus gp can be cleaved by proteases other than furin, as evidenced by the detection of gp2 in virions with mutant gps lacking the furin recognition site.",PMC114066,PMC114066_0
"The extent of Ebola virus gp cleavage by furin does not correlate with viral infectivity, as observed in two different pseudotype systems.",PMC114066,PMC114066_1
"Ebola virus gp is posttranslationally acylated with palmitic acids at the cys670 and cys672 residues in the transmembrane anchor region of the molecule, and both of these cysteine residues are acylated.",PMC114066,PMC114066_2
"Endothelial cells and hepatocytes are not necessarily the preferred targets of Ebola virus gp, as evidenced by the lower infectivities of these cells compared to human kidney epithelial cells.",PMC114066,PMC114066_3
"Antiserum to Ebola virus gp/sgp can neutralize the infectivity of a murine retrovirus pseudotyped with the Zaire gp, indicating the presence of subtype-specific neutralizing epitopes on Ebola virus gp molecules, and the neutralizing activity can be markedly reduced in the presence of Zaire sgp, suggesting that gp and sgp share neutralizing epitopes.",PMC114066,PMC114066_4
