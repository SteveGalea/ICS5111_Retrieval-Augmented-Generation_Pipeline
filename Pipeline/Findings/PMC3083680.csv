"The study found that glycyrrhizin consumption in ar mice decreases blood and nasal mucosa antioxidant enzymes activities, lipid peroxidation, and GSH levels, and enhances IFN-γ levels while reducing IL-4 levels, thus protecting the nasal mucosa oxidative injury and improving immunity activity in ar mice.",PMC3083680,PMC3083680_0
"The study revealed that glycyrrhizin and lycopene treatments in ar mice led to significant increases in antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, CAT, GSH-PX, TAOC, and SOD activities, while decreasing MDA levels.",PMC3083680,PMC3083680_1
"The study showed that treatment with glycyrrhizin in ar mice resulted in a significant increase in IFN-γ levels and a decrease in IL-4 levels, indicating a potential role of glycyrrhizin in improving immunity activity in ar mice.",PMC3083680,PMC3083680_2
"The study found that treatment with glycyrrhizin in ar mice led to significant increases in GSH content with concomitant decreases in MDA formation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the antioxidant properties of glycyrrhizin.",PMC3083680,PMC3083680_3
"The study revealed that treatment with lycopene in ar mice led to significant increases in IFN-γ levels and a decrease in IL-4 levels in ar mice, indicating the potential role of lycopene in simultaneously suppressing IL-4 and increasing IFN-γ production in ar mice.",PMC3083680,PMC3083680_4
