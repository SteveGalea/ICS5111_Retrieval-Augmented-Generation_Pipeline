A study in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) found that at least some healthcare workers (HCWs) have previous exposure or infection to Ebola virus (EBOV) based on serological evidence. The study's findings suggest that the prevalence of EBOV exposure or infection among HCWs and the general population in the region may be higher than previously reported.,PMC6350949,PMC6350949_0
"The study identified significant heterogeneity in EBOV seroprevalence among HCWs based on patient contact. The highest EBOV glycoprotein (GP) seroprevalence was observed in the ""unlikely"" contact group, which may indicate endemic EBOV exposure in the area.",PMC6350949,PMC6350949_1
"The study also found that 16 (2.8%) of HCWs who never reported infection were seroreactive for at least one EBOV protein and may also have neutralizing capacity, suggesting that some seroreactive individuals could have been exposed to a non-EBOV filovirus.",PMC6350949,PMC6350949_2
The study highlights the need for additional research to better understand the roles that each EBOV protein plays in immune response and the significance of EBOV exposure and risk factors associated with these exposures to improve locally sustainable strategies to limit exposure of HCWs to EBOV and other pathogens.,PMC6350949,PMC6350949_3
"The study also underscores the need for providing adequate training of HCWs to infection control procedures and availability of personal protective equipment to reduce exposure to bodily fluids of patients they treat before an EBOV outbreak occurs, as limiting exposure of HCWs to EBOV and other blood-borne pathogens is ultimately one of the most important strategies to limit the spread of EBOV and other pathogens.",PMC6350949,PMC6350949_4
