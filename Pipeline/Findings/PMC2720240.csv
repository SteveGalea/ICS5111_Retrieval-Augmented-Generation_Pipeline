"The study identified drak2 as a crucial negative regulator of t-cell activation, with opposing phenotypic consequences to those observed with the cox-2-mediated lethal t-cell activation.",PMC2720240,PMC2720240_0
The study confirmed that silencing drak2 expression in vitro promotes cell survival and abrogates the effects of a cox-2 inhibitor in vitro.,PMC2720240,PMC2720240_1
The study demonstrated that drak2 expression in colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo is regulated by cox-2.,PMC2720240,PMC2720240_2
"The study identified a cluster of genes showing similar cyclical changes in expression with cell-cycle periodicity in hela cells, which included drak2 and overlapped with cox-2-regulated genes identified by previous gene discovery studies.",PMC2720240,PMC2720240_3
"The study suggested that the ribosomal kinase p70s6 is a substrate for drak2, highlighting a possible involvement in regulation of cell-cycle dynamics.",PMC2720240,PMC2720240_4
