"A study by Southern Research Institute in collaboration with The Galveston National Laboratory has successfully implemented an hts platform in BSL-4 containment using nipah virus as a prototype BSL-4 virus. This platform allows for the screening of up to 10,000 compounds from small molecule libraries at a single dose, and up to 1000 hit compounds for concentration-dependent dose response, per day.",PMC3994909,PMC3994909_0
Three sulfonamide compounds with ec50 values less than 12 μm and selectivity values ranging from 3 to 13 have been identified as hits in the hts assay against nipah virus.,PMC3994909,PMC3994909_1
"All three hit compounds inhibit nipah virus infection for up to 6 hours post-infection, suggesting that each compound targets the virus during the very late stage of the virus's replication, rather than the early entry or later stages of assembly.",PMC3994909,PMC3994909_2
"A previous report by Southern Research Institute identified three hit compounds with ec50 values less than 12 μm and selectivity values ranging from 3 to 13 in an hts assay against nipah virus. These compounds have not been identified as hits in any other bioassay, indicating that they are specific for nipah virus, or possibly other henipaviruses.",PMC3994909,PMC3994909_3
"The development of hts technology for BSL-4 addresses the dual threat of emerging pathogens that exhibit high mobility and mortality and the possibility of these pathogens being used as a bioterrorist weapon. The hts platform provides a crucial, needed tool for modern drug development against highly pathogenic viruses.",PMC3994909,PMC3994909_4
