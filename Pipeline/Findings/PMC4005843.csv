"In the study conducted in Vila do Maio, located on Maio Island, Cape Verde, under a neutering and health surveillance program developed by veterinarians without frontiers, Portugal (VSF), in two distinct periods, 2010 with collection of rectal swabs from 53 animals, and 2011, including blood samples (n=88) and rectal swabs (n=93) from 125 animals, the viral nucleic acid was extracted from rectal swabs for viral dna and rna co-extraction using a commercial kit for co-extraction of viral nucleic acids from a non-recommended biological matrix, according to the manufacturer's instructions, for canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine coronavirus (CCV) rna, and canine distemper virus (CDV) dna. The findings were organized into three classes: 1) low titer (iif values: 1/20-1/40), 2) medium titer (iif values: 1/80-1/160), and 3) high titer (iif values: ≥ 1/320).",PMC4005843,PMC4005843_0
"In the study conducted in Vila do Maio, the viral nucleic acid was amplified from CPV rna (Caniffa®, Merial) using a formula provided by the manufacturer's instructions, for specific IgG detection, according to the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Ingénzim Canine Parvo 15.CPV.K1® and Ingénzim Moquillo 1.5.CDG.K1®-Ingénzim), and from CCV rna (Caniffa®, Merial) using a similar approach, with the CCV recombinant plasmid being used as a positive control.",PMC4005843,PMC4005843_1
"In the study conducted in Vila do Maio, the viral nucleic acid was amplified from CCV rna (Caniffa®, Merial) using a similar approach as for CCV, and the CCV recombinant plasmid was used as a positive control. The findings were organized into three classes: 1) low titer",PMC4005843,PMC4005843_2
