"The study found that the most frequently detected viruses in respiratory samples were human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/EV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human coronavirus (HCoV).",PMC3754627,PMC3754627_0
"HRV/EV, RSV, and HCoV were also the most common viruses in immunosuppressed patients, with HCoV being the second most commonly detected virus in this population.",PMC3754627,PMC3754627_1
"In HCoV-positive immunosuppressed patients, clinical manifestations of lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) were more frequently observed in association with HRV/EV, RSV, and other respiratory viruses or noninfectious respiratory diseases, suggesting the involvement of possible associated pathogens or noninfectious respiratory diseases before attributing the unique etiology of an lrti to HCoV.",PMC3754627,PMC3754627_2
"The study highlighted that respiratory viruses exhibit different association patterns during multiple infections, suggesting complex relationships that might occur between respiratory viruses and their host in the respiratory tract.",PMC3754627,PMC3754627_3
"The study found that a unique preferential codetection was observed between the HCoV subtypes 229E and HCoV-HKU1, but for all other statistically significant pairs of viruses, viral cosuppression was common.",PMC3754627,PMC3754627_4
