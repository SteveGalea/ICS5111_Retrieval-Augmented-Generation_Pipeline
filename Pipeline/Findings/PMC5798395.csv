"In a study by Han et al., they identified a pool of genes that are essential for the intracellular survival of mycobacterium abscessus inside young cochlear implant recipients. These genes are characterized by severe disease and high mortality. The study suggests that the ability to accurately predict speech improvement for young children who use cochlear implants would be a first step in the development of a personalized therapy to enhance their language development.",PMC5798395,PMC5798395_0
"A study by Feng et al. Described a method to demembranate whole spheroids using a nonionic detergent, with the addition of ATP reactivating flagellar motility. These reactivated spheroids swam like live spheroids, and flagellar beating direction was altered in a Ca2+-dependent manner, with a greater change in the anterior hemisphere than in the posterior hemisphere. These findings indicate that V. Rousseletii has an anterior-posterior gradient of flagellar sensitivity to Ca2+, which likely plays a key role in V. Rousseletii phototaxis.",PMC5798395,PMC5798395_1
"A study by Zhang et al. Described a large-scale comparative epigenomics that reveals hierarchical regulation of non-CG methylation in Arabidopsis. The study identified high-confidence differentially methylated regions and compared libraries using a hierarchical framework, allowing them to identify relationships between methylation pathways. By using a large number of independent wild-type control libraries, they effectively filtered out spontaneous methylation changes from those that are biologically meaningful.",PMC5798395,PMC5798395_2
"In a study by Choi et al., they reported the identification of a chemokine-like gene family, Samdori (Sam), and presented functional characterization of Sam2. The study described a method to demembranate whole spheroids using a nonionic detergent, with the addition of ATP reactivating flagellar motility. These reactivated spheroids swam like live spheroids, and flagellar beating direction was altered in a Ca2+-dependent manner, with a greater change in the anterior hemisphere than in the posterior hemisphere. These findings indicate that V. Rousseletii has an anterior-posterior gradient of flagellar sensitivity to Ca2+, which likely plays a key role in V.",PMC5798395,PMC5798395_3
