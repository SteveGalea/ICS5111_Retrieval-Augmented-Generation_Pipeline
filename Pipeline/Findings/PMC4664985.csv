"The method of virus inactivation via uv-a exposure in the presence of amt is effective for multiple families of viruses, including segmented and enveloped viruses, as well as those with positive- and negative-sense rna genomes.",PMC4664985,PMC4664985_0
The level of uv-a exposure time and amt concentration required to inactivate each virus is species-specific and may even be strain-specific.,PMC4664985,PMC4664985_1
"The method allows for virus preparations to be used in vaccine development, in antibody generation for research, as positive controls for antibody-based detection assays, or studied by microscopy, as the surface proteins of the inactivated viruses are intact and correctly oriented, allowing full interactions with cells and protein complexes.",PMC4664985,PMC4664985_2
The nucleic acids extracted from amt-inactivated viruses are non-infectious and sufficiently undamaged to achieve successful detection by reverse-transcription real-time pcr and next-generation sequencing.,PMC4664985,PMC4664985_3
"The method provides inactive, non-infectious virus preparations that may be reliably sterility tested without attempting to remove toxic chemicals from the preparations, as it allows for virus preparations and genomic material from pathogenic samples to be quickly and safely accessed.",PMC4664985,PMC4664985_4
