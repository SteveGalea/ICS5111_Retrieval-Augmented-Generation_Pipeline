"TMV, a nonpathogenic plant virus, was successfully used as a carrier and delivery vector for a protective epitope from mHV, a human pathogen, resulting in the induction of high-titer antibodies and protection against mHV infection in mice.",PMC22137,PMC22137_0
"The 5b19 epitope, part of the mHV glycoprotein, was fused to the carboxy-terminus of the coat protein (CP) of TMV, and this chimeric virus was able to elicit a protective immune response against mHV in mice.",PMC22137,PMC22137_1
"The high-dose regimen of immunization, consisting of three injections per week for 10 weeks, resulted in high titers of antibodies against both the mHV glycoprotein and the 5b19 epitope, as well as high survival rates in mice challenged with mHV strain jhm.",PMC22137,PMC22137_2
"Mice that received a low dose of immunogen and had high anti-5b19 IgG titers but low anti-5b19 IgA titers were not protected against mHV infection, suggesting that IgG alone may not be responsible for the protection against mHV infection.",PMC22137,PMC22137_3
"The TMV system, with its high yield of immunogen at low cost, may be suitable for oral vaccine development, as it combines the advantages of a nonpathogenic virus and mucosal targeting.",PMC22137,PMC22137_4
