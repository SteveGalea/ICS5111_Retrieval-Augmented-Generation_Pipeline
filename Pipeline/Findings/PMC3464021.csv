"Empirical studies have found that genetic variation in host populations can reduce the spread of infectious diseases, such as malaria in wild populations of Anopheles mosquitoes (Altermatt and Ebert, 2008) and bacterial infections in wild populations of Daphnia magna (Ganz and Ebert, 2010). These studies suggest that a 'handful' of host genotypes with genetic variation in resistance can be enough to reduce disease spread, as opposed to the traditional view that host populations should be homogenous to reduce transmission.",PMC3464021,PMC3464021_0
"Theoretical models also support the idea that genetic variation in host populations can reduce disease spread. A recent model suggests that increases in the genetic diversity of host populations can have a large effect on disease spread, as long as each parasite genotype can only infect one genetically determined resistance phenotype in the host population (Lively, 2010a). This assumption is consistent with the 'matching-alleles' model for infection, which is supported by studies on invertebrate immunity (Grosberg and Hart, 2000; Carius et al., 2001; Dybdahl et al., 2008; Duneau et al., 2011; Luijckx et al., 2011). The model suggests that r0, the average number of secondary infections produced by a single infected host, depends on total host density and the frequency of matching host genotypes, where matches between host and parasite genotypes yield an infection. The effect of host density on r0 is density dependent and asymptotic on bgi, where gi is the frequency of the matching host genotype, and b is the number of parasite propagules produced by each infection that make contact with a host.",PMC3464021,PMC3464021_1
"Empirical studies have found that high genetic diversity in host populations can buffer host populations against disease spread in natural populations of vertebrates, such as cheetahs, sea lions, fish, and frogs (unpublished data). These findings suggest that there is a threshold value for the genetic diversity of host populations above which parasites can be eliminated. Determining the threshold value may have great value for conserving endangered species and mediating vector-human-parasite transmission.",PMC3464021,PMC3464021_2
