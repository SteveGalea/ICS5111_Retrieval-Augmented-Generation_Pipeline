"The willingness of healthcare workers in Hong Kong to accept pre-pandemic influenza vaccination is low, with a response rate of below 50%. This is consistent with the low acceptance of seasonal influenza vaccination among healthcare workers worldwide, where only 32.9% of healthcare workers in Hong Kong and 15.6% of healthcare workers in the UK would accept pre-pandemic vaccination during the SARS outbreak.",PMC2731837,PMC2731837_0
The main barriers to vaccination identified in this study are fear of side effects and doubts about the efficacy of the vaccines. A history of seasonal influenza vaccination and perceived likelihood of being infected are also associated with the intention to accept vaccination.,PMC2731837,PMC2731837_1
"The study highlights that efforts to improve the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination by healthcare workers should be a part of pandemic preparedness plans, as disseminating correct information may be more difficult during crises.",PMC2731837,PMC2731837_2
"The study suggests that public health agencies should provide more information to staff, especially to those with higher levels of anxiety and doubt.",PMC2731837,PMC2731837_3
"The study found that younger staff and staff with less than five years of working experience are more willing to accept vaccination. However, this does not necessarily indicate that the experience of the SARS outbreak enhanced the willingness to accept the vaccination.",PMC2731837,PMC2731837_4
"The study also found that the uptake rate for seasonal influenza vaccine among elderly people in Hong Kong varies among the target groups, and more than 90% of elderly people in institutions received influenza vaccine delivered on site.",PMC2731837,PMC2731837_5
The study suggests that there are common barriers to influenza vaccination that exist across geographical regions and racial groups.,PMC2731837,PMC2731837_6
The study highlights that campaigns to promote vaccination should consider addressing the knowledge gap of staff and the specific target groups for intervention.,PMC2731837,PMC2731837_7
"The study also suggests that further qualitative studies, such as focus group discussions or semi-structured interviews, should be conducted to consolidate and supplement the findings.",PMC2731837,PMC2731837_8
"The study concludes that a successful vaccination strategy should not only protect the health of healthcare workers but also limit the transmission between the health sector and the community, as a lesson from the SARS outbreak.",PMC2731837,PMC2731837_9
