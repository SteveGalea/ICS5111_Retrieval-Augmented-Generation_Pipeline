"Ata, a small molecule, inhibits the replication of vaccinia virus, a close relative of smallpox and monkeypox viruses, by down-regulating the activity of the enzyme h1l and inhibiting the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway component ERK.",PMC1865980,PMC1865980_0
"The inhibition of h1l by ata occurs through the inhibition of its tyrosine phosphatase activity, as demonstrated by in vitro enzyme activity assays, with an IC50 value of approximately 2.2 Î¼g/ml.",PMC1865980,PMC1865980_1
"The low toxicity of ata, as evidenced by its CC50 values and its easy reversibility of its effect on cells, combined with its potent and selective inhibition of vaccinia virus replication, makes it an ideal drug candidate for further study.",PMC1865980,PMC1865980_2
"Ata strongly inhibits ERK phosphorylation, as evidenced by the drastic decrease in its phosphorylated state, as early as 10 minutes post-treatment, and the sustained inhibition throughout the time course.",PMC1865980,PMC1865980_3
"Ata inhibition of ERK phosphorylation is required during the early stage of vaccinia virus replication, as demonstrated by the observation that ata treatment during infection is required to have any inhibitory effect, and the absence of ata in the first hour of infection results in viral titers approaching those of untreated controls, followed by the removal of the ata and the return of the level of ERK phosphorylation to control levels.",PMC1865980,PMC1865980_4
