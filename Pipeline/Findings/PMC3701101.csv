"The virome, or the collection of viruses in a microbial community, is a major component of the human microbiome, and its study is important for understanding human health and disease.",PMC3701101,PMC3701101_0
"Virome analysis has revealed vast genomic diversity in the oceanic ecosystem and in the gut microbiome of healthy adults and infants, with the majority of viral sequences being novel.",PMC3701101,PMC3701101_1
"Virome analysis has also shown that bacteriophages, which influence their host bacteria and contribute genes that affect the structure and functions of microbial communities, encode antibiotic resistance genes and other genes associated with bacterial metabolic pathways.",PMC3701101,PMC3701101_2
"Virome analysis has identified novel eukaryotic viruses, such as astroviruses, caliciviruses, and parvoviruses, associated with diarrhea and respiratory illness, as well as known viruses in unexpected tissues.",PMC3701101,PMC3701101_3
"Virome analysis has also shown that the presence of a disease, such as cystic fibrosis, can cause changes in the microbiome, including bacteriophage communities in healthy people that are unique to each individual and similar bacteriophage communities in individuals with cf that are thought to reflect effects of their airway pathology.",PMC3701101,PMC3701101_4
"The study of viral metagenomes in clinical samples may have potential applications as a diagnostic method, as sequence-based analysis of viral communities has shown sensitivity comparable to virus-specific polymerase chain reaction.",PMC3701101,PMC3701101_5
"Virome analysis may also be informative for patient management, as it can reveal medically relevant viruses and genes detected, which can be further evaluated and confirmed using virus-specific assays, and genes encoded by viruses that may affect planned treatments or antibiotic or antiviral resistance.",PMC3701101,PMC3701101_6
