"The study found that xenosurveillance, using blood-fed mosquitoes as sampling method, is a viable alternative for collecting human blood samples used in pathogen surveillance, with substantially fewer losses of reads compared to traditional sampling methods.",PMC5880402,PMC5880402_0
"The study identified genetic signatures of two viruses, gbv-c and hbv, using bioinformatics and molecular methods, respectively, from individual dbs.",PMC5880402,PMC5880402_1
"The study showed that xenosurveillance is less invasive and logistically challenging compared to traditional sampling methods, as mosquitoes constantly take blood meals from humans, especially in the tropics, and sample storage is simple and cost effective.",PMC5880402,PMC5880402_2
The study highlighted the potential for routine xenosurveillance to provide early warnings by detecting emerging pathogens circulating at low levels in vulnerable populations.,PMC5880402,PMC5880402_3
"The study indicated that zoonotic, viral pathogens are disproportionately likely to reach pandemic emergence, as compared to parasites or bacteria, and recent pandemics of zoonotic viruses support this notion.",PMC5880402,PMC5880402_4
