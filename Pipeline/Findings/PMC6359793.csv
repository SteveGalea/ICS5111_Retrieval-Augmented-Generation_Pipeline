"Neutralizing antibodies (NA) to the vaccine strain are first detected at day 56 and remain at similar levels until challenge, with a subsequent boost after challenge.",PMC6359793,PMC6359793_3
"The administration of the PRRSV-1 based MLV vaccine to 1-day-old piglets is able to induce an immune response characterized by these findings, and the vaccine has been shown to be effective against a heterologous strain, as evidenced by a reduction in viraemia and nasal shedding after challenge.",PMC6359793,PMC6359793_4
