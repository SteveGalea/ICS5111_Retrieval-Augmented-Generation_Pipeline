"The realamp method, a rapid real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of a. Baumannii, was developed by using an ESI-Quant tube scanner and was shown to be a potential tool for field use as a result of its high sensitivity and specificity, rapidity, lower contamination rate, and easy standardization.",PMC3699609,PMC3699609_0
"The realamp method was at least 10-fold more sensitive than the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and was able to differentiate between A. Baumannii and Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus, which are grouped together as the Ac-Ab complex due to their considerable epidemiological and clinically relevant differences.",PMC3699609,PMC3699609_1
"The realamp method was also able to detect A. Baumannii isolates, which would not be affected by biochemical reactions, as the slower rate of metabolism of A. Baumannii could cause weaker fluorescent biochemical reactions in the reaction wells of the Vitek 2 system ID-GNB cards, leading to more discrepant identifications with the Vitek 2 system.",PMC3699609,PMC3699609_2
"The realamp method was able to detect A. Baumannii isolates, which would not be affected by biochemical reactions, as the targets for detection are representative sequences from the pathogens, alive or dead, and culture-based assays, on the other hand, detect all living bacterial cells grown in the culture media.",PMC3699609,PMC3699609_3
"The realamp method will be more attractive for field use if the realamp reagents can be made into dry powder and stored at room temperature without requiring a cold chain, as this would make the realamp method more convenient for use in basic healthcare settings.",PMC3699609,PMC3699609_4
