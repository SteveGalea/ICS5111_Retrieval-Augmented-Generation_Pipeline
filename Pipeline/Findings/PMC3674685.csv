"The present study demonstrated the feasibility of using lactococcus lactis as a vaccine delivery vehicle for displaying the m2 protein, a highly conserved and nonglycosylated antigen from the influenza virus, for cross-subtype protection against avian influenza.",PMC3674685,PMC3674685_0
"The study found that most of the vaccinated chickens developed a significant m2e-specific serum IgG response, and birds vaccinated intranasally with lactococcus lactis-m2e or vaccinated subcutaneously with m2e conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin survived infectious challenge longer than nonvaccinated birds.",PMC3674685,PMC3674685_1
"The study also found that birds vaccinated subcutaneously with m2e conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin had a lower mean viral burden than either of the other two groups, and an analysis of the data suggested that protection may be due to m2e-specific serum IgG.",PMC3674685,PMC3674685_2
The study noted that the lack of robust m2e-specific fecal IgG or CD4+ T lymphocyte response could be due to differential processing of antigen by the immune system and further exploration is needed to understand this finding.,PMC3674685,PMC3674685_3
"The study suggested that l. Lactis-m2e induced mainly a humoral response, but less significant cellular response, and further research is needed to determine whether this is a reflection of the lower amount of virus in tracheal swabs in birds vaccinated with lactococcus lactis-m2e compared to nonvaccinated birds.",PMC3674685,PMC3674685_4
