"The study found that respiratory viruses are commonly detected in children in the Papua New Guinea highlands, with a high rate of multiple viral infections, particularly in children with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI).",PMC3383990,PMC3383990_0
"The study identified adenoviruses, influenza A virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as significant contributors to ALRI in children, with mixed infections being more likely to be associated with ALRI than with non-ALRI samples.",PMC3383990,PMC3383990_1
"The study found that picornaviruses, including newly identified species C47 and C48, were not associated with ALRI, although multiple viruses were commonly detected in both ALRI and non-ALRI samples.",PMC3383990,PMC3383990_2
"The study emphasized the importance of both accurate characterization and speciation of viruses and the inclusion of control populations, as the newer nucleic acid detection methods did not detect additional significant respiratory pathogens.",PMC3383990,PMC3383990_3
"The study highlighted the need for infection control measures to prevent spread of respiratory viruses, including adenoviruses, influenza A virus, and RSV, within healthcare and community settings, particularly in light of the significant health impact of these viruses on children with ALRI.",PMC3383990,PMC3383990_4
