"SARS-CoV-specific IgM was detected in 79% and IgG in 98% of SARS patients by indirect fluorescent antibody (ifa) tests, while Elisa detected IgM in 90% and IgG in 82% of patients. Controls did not have SARS-CoV antibodies by ifa, but one person in each of the hepatitis B, C, and HIV groups had IgM or IgG antibodies by Elisa.",PMC440623,PMC440623_0
"The sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-specific IgG detection by ifa for RT-PCR-positive patients were both 98%, compared to 81% and 99% by Elisa, respectively. Both ifa and Elisa had 100% positive predictive value (PPV) for IgG detection, while ifa had a higher PPV for IgM detection (100%) than Elisa (99%).",PMC440623,PMC440623_1
"SARS-CoV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies appeared early in the illness, with IgG detected in 59% and IgM in 36% of samples collected during the first 14 days of illness. By day 25, all samples were seropositive for IgG, and IgM levels dropped as early as 2-3 weeks after onset.",PMC440623,PMC440623_2
"SARS-CoV-specific IgG was detected in all patients 2-3 months after disease onset, while IgM and IgA seropositivity was lost in some individuals.",PMC440623,PMC440623_3
"In a study of 75 SARS cases, seroconversion occurred by day 20, and IgG was detected earlier by ifa than by Elisa. The study also found that 89.1% of patients in a single institution who fit the SARS clinical case definition had laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV infection.",PMC440623,PMC440623_4
