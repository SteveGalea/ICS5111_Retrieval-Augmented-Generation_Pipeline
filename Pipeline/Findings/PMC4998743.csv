"RSV was detected in air samples collected at a short distance (60-180 cm) from the head of the patient's bed, but not at a long distance (320 cm).",PMC4998743,PMC4998743_0
RSV was found on all objects tested except for the television remote control buttons.,PMC4998743,PMC4998743_1
"Adenovirus and m pneumoniae were detected at very high rates on all object types tested, with the highest detection rates for the call buttons and television remote control buttons.",PMC4998743,PMC4998743_2
The median concentration of m pneumoniae in swab samples of objects was significantly higher than that of RSV.,PMC4998743,PMC4998743_3
The absence of enterovirus from air samples and object surface swabs indicates that the likelihood of air and/or droplet transmission of this virus was extremely low.,PMC4998743,PMC4998743_4
