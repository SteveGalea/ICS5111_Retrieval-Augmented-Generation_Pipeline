"A study in New Zealand found that among arriving airline passengers, 17% reported respiratory symptoms and 1% tested positive for influenza virus. However, entry screening for influenza infection would be either very resource intensive (testing and potentially quarantining 17% of arriving travelers using “any symptom”) or ineffective (allowing 97% of infected arrivals to enter the community if measured fever was used).",PMC4561613,PMC4561613_0
"The study also found that among this population, entry screening for influenza infection would be either very resource intensive (testing and potentially quarantining 17% of arriving travelers using “any symptom”) or ineffective (allowing 97% of infected arrivals to enter the community if measured fever was used).",PMC4561613,PMC4561613_1
"Lower response rates to health questionnaires at younger ages may have led to some bias in estimates of the prevalence of symptoms and of influenza, as younger respondents had a higher prevalence of symptoms than did older respondents.",PMC4561613,PMC4561613_2
"The study was carried out during a “normal” influenza season, when the predominant strain was influenza b.16, and found that during influenza pandemics, the prevalence of influenza among travelers might be higher than in this study, which would improve ppvs but also mean that more asymptomatic infected travelers would enter the community (because of the poor sensitivity of screening criteria).",PMC4561613,PMC4561613_3
"The study also found that among this population, entry screening for influenza infection would be either very resource intensive (testing and potentially quarantining 17% of arriving travelers using “any symptom”) or ineffective (allowing 97% of infected arrivals to enter the community if measured fever was used), as a proportion of those infected with influenza will be asymptomatic on arrival and some people with symptoms will not report them.",PMC4561613,PMC4561613_4
