"The study identified five new chemical entities, compounds 6, 7, 9, and 13, as potential therapeutics for treating inflammation-related illnesses. These compounds were found to have high inhibitory activity against phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), a key enzyme involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium signaling and inflammation.",PMC4280171,PMC4280171_0
"Compounds 6 and 7 showed potent inhibitory activity against PDE4 in vitro assays, with IC50 values ranging from 0.001 to 10 µM. These compounds also demonstrated high selectivity for PDE4 over other PDE enzymes, with IC50 values for PDE3, PDE5, and PDE6 being greater than 100 µM.",PMC4280171,PMC4280171_1
"In sepsis and lps-induced acute lung injury models, compounds 6, 7, 9, and 13 significantly reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6. These compounds also showed high efficacy in raw 264.7 cells and primary human macrophages (pBMCS), with IC50 values ranging from 0.001 to 10 µM.",PMC4280171,PMC4280171_2
"In a h1n1 influenza virus-induced pneumonia model, compounds 6, 7, 9, and 13 significantly reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6. These compounds also showed high efficacy in raw 264.7 cells and primary human macrophages (pBMCS), with IC50 values ranging from 0.001 to 10 µM.",PMC4280171,PMC4280171_3
"In vitro assays using purified human recombinant PDE4a4 showed that compounds 6, 7, 9, and 13 significantly reduced PDE4 activity, with IC50 values ranging from 0.001 to 10 µM. These compounds also showed high selectivity for PDE4 over other PDE enzymes, with IC50 values for PDE3, PDE5,",PMC4280171,PMC4280171_4
