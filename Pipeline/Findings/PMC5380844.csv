"A new coronavirus, named predict/pdf-2180, has been identified in a bat caught in Uganda in 2013. This virus is closely related to SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and MERS-CoV, which causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).",PMC5380844,PMC5380844_0
"The genome of predict/pdf-2180 is 99% identical to that of a bat coronavirus, Uganda-2012, which was isolated in 2012.",PMC5380844,PMC5380844_1
"The predict/pdf-2180 virus can infect human airway epithelial cells, and it can also replicate in human lung cells, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",PMC5380844,PMC5380844_2
"The predict/pdf-2180 virus has been found to be closely related to a bat coronavirus, Kampo, which was isolated in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2014.",PMC5380844,PMC5380844_3
"The predict/pdf-2180 virus contains a unique spike glycoprotein, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is essential for virus entry into host cells. However, the spike glycoprotein of predict/pdf-2180 is distinct from those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",PMC5380844,PMC5380844_4
