"Demand for critical care services can exceed available resources during epidemics or bioterrorist attacks, leading to potential shortages of staff, beds, and equipment.",PMC1269436,PMC1269436_0
"In such situations, more lives could be saved by delivering a basic mode of mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support, antibiotic or disease-specific countermeasure therapy, and prophylactic interventions to a larger number of critically ill patients, rather than providing 'traditional' critical care to only a few initial victims.",PMC1269436,PMC1269436_1
"Triage during a large or sustained epidemic will remain taxed, and priority should be given to people most likely to benefit from modified critical care interventions based on physiologic parameters.",PMC1269436,PMC1269436_2
"Medical professionals, hospital staff, and the affected patient community should participate in the development and review of mass care triage standards and protocols to ensure fairness and understanding.",PMC1269436,PMC1269436_3
"Rapid learning in the face of an outbreak is essential, and technology systems that enable sharing and near real-time analysis of aggregated data could be invaluable for illuminating the course of new or unfamiliar diseases, improving clinical diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy, predicting disease outcome, and refining triage protocols.",PMC1269436,PMC1269436_4
