"The study reveals that hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) expression and secretion in cells and in mice can induce the secretion of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC), also known as chemokine (C-X3, C-X3, C-X3, C-X3), which is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, monocytes, T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells.",PMC2838095,PMC2838095_0
"The study shows that HBsAg-expressing mice exhibit elevated serum levels of CINC, which is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells surrounding HBsAg-positive hepatocytes.",PMC2838095,PMC2838095_1
"The study indicates that the inflammatory effect observed is associated with HBsAg expression and secretion but not due to a general induction by the expression of an irrelevant foreign protein, as pretreatment with cyclosporine (Cs), which is known to block the chemotactic function of CINC, reduces the serum CINC to the normal levels and prevents the infiltration of lymphocytes in the liver.",PMC2838095,PMC2838095_2
"The study suggests that the anti-CINC receptor protein, CD147, is involved in inducing inflammatory responses in the studied mouse model, as anti-CD147 antibody treatment decreases the serum CINC and inflammatory foci in the liver.",PMC2838095,PMC2838095_3
"The study reveals that CINC secretion induced by HBsAg expression and secretion might contribute to the pathogenesis of HBV infection, as serum CINC appears to be higher in chronic HBV patients than in healthy subjects, and the majority of patients after liver transplantation exhibit a reduction in serum CINC.",PMC2838095,PMC2838095_4
