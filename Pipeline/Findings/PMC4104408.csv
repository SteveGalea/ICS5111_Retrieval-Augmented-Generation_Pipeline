"A systems biology approach has been used to define the innate immune molecular signatures that control tissue tropism to West Nile virus (WNV) infection, revealing a previously unappreciated role for cell- and tissue-specific innate defense programs in controlling viral replication and tropism. This study identified natural killer cells as key mediators of WNV restriction within the liver and demonstrated their expansion and activation following WNV infection, which was dependent on type I interferon signaling and the ridge spleen associated transmembrane protein (RSAM).",PMC4104408,PMC4104408_0
"High-throughput based screening assays have provided a rapid approach to identify host factors that either support or restrict WNV replication. Screening by Jiang et al. identified RSAD2 and ISG20 as cellular enzymes that efficiently suppress WNV infection, likely targeting viral RNA or protein biosynthesis. Schoggins et al. screened over 380 human genes and identified several additional interferon-stimulated genes, including pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), transcription factors (TFs), and uncharacterized antiviral genes that restrict WNV infection.",PMC4104408,PMC4104408_1
"Loss-of-function-based approaches, typically involving gene silencing through siRNA or shRNA-based technologies, have been used to identify host genes that facilitate WNV infection. Li et al. used shRNA to screen 245 human ISGs and identified 47 host genes that negatively impacted WNV replication, including previously identified genes (e.g., MAVS, STAT2, IRF1, IFIM2, and PKR) and novel ISGs (e.g., DDX24, IFI44L, IFI6, TRIM21, and TRIM6).",PMC4104408,PMC4104408_2
"High-throughput based screening assays have provided a platform to identify host genes involved in controlling WNV replication. Yasunaga et al. used drosophila to identify cell-intrinsic antiviral genes that restrict WNV infection, including members of the Tip60 acetylase complex and DXPO1, which control nuclear export of specific host mRNAs, possess antiviral activity against WNV infection.",PMC4104408,PMC4104408_3
