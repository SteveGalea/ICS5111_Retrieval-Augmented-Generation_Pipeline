"The crystal structure of recombinant niv-g, expressed in insect cells, reveals a monomeric form of the envelope protein, which is consistent with previous studies on hemagglutinins from other paramyxoviruses. The structure shows that the largest intermolecular interface in the niv-g crystal occludes only 600 Å² of surface, inconsistent with oligomerization, but packing interactions of the β-propeller domains in the crystal structures of other paramyxoviruses demonstrate dimeric and tetrameric arrangements.",PMC2583688,PMC2583688_0
"The structure of recombinant niv-g shows significant structural divergence along the face formed by the propeller blades β2 to β4 and structural similarity on the opposing face, which is consistent with the suggestion that the surface of the β1 and β6 propeller blades forms the putative oligomerization face of niv-g. This face mediates dimerization of sv5, piv3, and ndv hemagglutin neuraminidases.",PMC2583688,PMC2583688_1
"The study reveals that over 2 kDa of carbohydrate may be attached to individual glycosylation sites on niv-g, but analysis reveals that the low degree of glycosylation site conservation suggests that there are no conserved structural roles for individual glycans, although the small number of glycosylation sites within this region are located at the membrane-proximal and distal faces of the glycoprotein and are not anticipated to disrupt lateral interactions.",PMC2583688,PMC2583688_2
"The study suggests that the putative oligomerization face based on the alignment of sequences of the envelope glycoprotein from viruses across the paramyxovirus family maps the putative oligomerization face of niv-g, and the presentation of the oligomeric interface in a heterogenous vaccine may lead to antibody responses toward the nonneutralizing epitopes. The ""immunofocusing"" approach of Pantophlet and Burton (47), in which additional n-linked glycosylation sites are added to nonneutralizing epitopes, could be used to generate a homogenous monomer that directs a neutralizing antibody response toward the ephrin binding",PMC2583688,PMC2583688_3
