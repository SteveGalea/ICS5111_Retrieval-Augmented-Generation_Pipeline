"In a study of children hospitalized for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in South Africa, the authors found that RSV coinfection with any other respiratory virus was not associated with more severe disease.",PMC5712444,PMC5712444_0
"The study also identified an association between RSV-adenovirus (ADV) coinfection and life-threatening disease in hospitalized children less than 5 years of age, suggesting that enhanced ADV disease may be driving more severe disease in children with RSV-ADV coinfection.",PMC5712444,PMC5712444_1
"The study found that viral load, as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) values, was not associated with disease severity in either RSV-positive children or RSV-ADV coinfection.",PMC5712444,PMC5712444_2
"The study noted that the prevalence of non-RSV respiratory viruses was lower in children hospitalized for viral respiratory illnesses during the RSV season, which could be indicative of viral interference in which the presence of RSV in the community inhibits infection by or circulation of other viruses.",PMC5712444,PMC5712444_3
"The study highlighted the need for further exploration of the clinical relevance of some of the identified viruses, as well as the need to better characterize viral coinfections within this population, given the limitations of the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) used and the cross-reactivity between some viruses.",PMC5712444,PMC5712444_4
