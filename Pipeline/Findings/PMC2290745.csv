"The cs-rosetta method, a new approach for predicting protein structures based on chemical shifts, has shown significant success in predicting structures of proteins with sizes up to 15 kDa. This method combines the regular rosetta monte carlo fragment assembly method with a knowledge-based side chain and backbone torsional potential. The resulting all-atom models are evaluated further in terms of the fitness with respect to the experimental chemical shifts.",PMC2290745,PMC2290745_0
"The cs-rosetta method has successfully predicted structures for 16 test proteins, including some challenging targets such as the human prion protein and the N-terminal domain of the human DNA-binding protein Ihf2.",PMC2290745,PMC2290745_1
"The method is also applicable to the study of systems not amenable by conventional NMR, such as structures of short-lived or unstable proteins in dynamic equilibrium with a more populated state.",PMC2290745,PMC2290745_2
"The method offers considerable time savings compared with conventional NMR methods, as it uses only backbone and 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, 15N, 1Hα, and 1Hbn chemical shifts, thereby obviating the need for side chain assignments and noe data collection.",PMC2290745,PMC2290745_3
"The method uses a complete example for GB3, as well as a structural database and fragment searching, which includes a lennard-jones potential, an orientation-dependent hydrogen bonding potential, an implicit solvation model, and a knowledge-based side chain and backbone torsional potential.",PMC2290745,PMC2290745_4
