"The study found that rottweilers had the highest percentage of positive cases of CPV, followed by boerboels and mixed breeds. No local breed or mongrel was presented during the study period.",PMC5733252,PMC5733252_1
"The study indicated that males and females were equally susceptible to CPV infection, which agrees with earlier reports.",PMC5733252,PMC5733252_2
"The study showed that puppies less than 6 months old were more susceptible to CPV, with a prevalence of 65.67%, whereas no positive cases were recorded in dogs older than 6 months.",PMC5733252,PMC5733252_3
"The study found that both vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs presented with CPV-associated clinical signs had a high prevalence of CPV infection. CPV was also detected in dogs without haemorrhagic diarrhoea, and not all dogs presented with haemorrhagic diarrhoea tested positive for CPV antigen.",PMC5733252,PMC5733252_4
