"In 1918, the medical team at Camp Brooks hospital in Brockline, Massachusetts, reported a relatively low fatality rate of hospital cases during the influenza pandemic, despite high infection rates.

The hospital comprised 13 tents, and patients were placed in the open air, with ""a maximum of sunshine and of fresh air day and night.""
