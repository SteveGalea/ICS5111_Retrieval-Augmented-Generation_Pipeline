"This study provides evidence for the fecal carriage of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) among dromedary camels located on a ranch in Laikipia, Kenya.",PMC6416407,PMC6416407_0
"Fifty-three percent (32.5%) of the STEC isolates possessed the virulence factor Stx2a, which is associated with severe disease in STEC-infected humans.",PMC6416407,PMC6416407_1
"The STEC isolates harboring Stx2a and the STEC O156:H25 isolates, in particular, exhibited a virulotype that suggests a potential health risk.",PMC6416407,PMC6416407_2
"While none of the fecal samples contained STEC O157:H7 or other non-O157 STEC serogroups frequently associated with severe clinical outcomes such as hemorrhagic colitis (HC), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), or HUS, the majority of the STEC isolates remained fully susceptible to all antimicrobials tested.",PMC6416407,PMC6416407_3
"The STEC O156:H25 isolates harbored the intimin gene eae, which is one of the most prominent virulence factors contributing to pathogenesis, and other virulence factors such as Ehx, Iss, Subab, and Asta, which are associated with non-bloody diarrhea and extra-intestinal pathogenic infections. These findings suggest that dromedary camels are a reservoir of human pathogenic STEC, and the occurrence of STEC in fecal samples from camels may represent a threat to humans, especially to those who live in long-term close contact with camels and consume raw camel milk.",PMC6416407,PMC6416407_4
