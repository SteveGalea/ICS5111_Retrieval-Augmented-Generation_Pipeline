"Dsrna species are produced in sufficient amounts in most animal virus infections to be readily detected by routine immunofluorescence antibody staining, except for negative-strand RNA viruses, which require the use of tyramide signal amplification.",PMC4542381,PMC4542381_0
"Viral countermeasures, such as the expression of dsrna binding proteins, limit or mask dsrna production in some virus infections, resulting in lower levels of detectable dsrna.",PMC4542381,PMC4542381_1
"Dsrna is a major viral trigger of the innate immune response but is subject to viral countermeasures, such as the expression of dsrna binding proteins, in some virus infections.",PMC4542381,PMC4542381_2
"Dsrna staining is observed in the cytoplasm, frequently in perinuclear locations, and is found in areas where viral factories are formed in most virus infections studied here and those described in the literature.",PMC4542381,PMC4542381_3
"Dsrna antibodies should have a role in viral discovery using next-generation sequencing because of the exclusion of ssrna in host tissues, as viral sequences comprise only a tiny fraction of a massive, complex, and largely irrelevant host rna data set in chronic viral infections where the nucleic acid of a virus may be present in ultralow abundance compared to the levels in acute infections.",PMC4542381,PMC4542381_4
