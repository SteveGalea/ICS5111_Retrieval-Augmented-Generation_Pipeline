"The study found that in mice with myocarditis at the superacute stage, there is a transient increase in QRS voltages, which may be due to intramyocardial edema caused by early myocardial damage.",PMC2435398,PMC2435398_0
"The study revealed that in mice with acute myocarditis, there is severe myocardial necrosis with inflammatory cellular infiltrations, which may reflect the low voltage of QRS complexes.",PMC2435398,PMC2435398_1
"The study showed that in mice with acute myocarditis, there is distinct interstitial edema of the ventricles at the superacute stage, which may contribute to the understanding of the precise course and mechanisms of electrocardiographic abnormalities that occur at the superacute and acute stages of myocarditis.",PMC2435398,PMC2435398_2
"The study found that in mice with myocarditis, many types of electrocardiographic abnormalities appeared, including atrial and ventricular premature contractions, and various degrees of AV block, as previously described.",PMC2435398,PMC2435398_3
"The study demonstrated that in mice with myocarditis, the virus was isolated from the hearts of all 20 mice examined on day 5, and the mortality rate was highest on day 5 and then decreased gradually, with 57.4% (135 of 235 mice) dying. The most prominent electrocardiographic characteristic was the trends toward increased heart rate and the transient increase in QRS voltages.",PMC2435398,PMC2435398_4
