"In a study using cattle, the authors found that a vaccine against the parasitic nematode Ostertagia ostertagi containing nk cell activating adjuvant, naphthoquinone (napq), induced a mixed interleukin (IL)-6 (IL-6)- and IL-12-dominant response.",PMC4941725,PMC4941725_0
"The authors also found that the vaccine stimulated the production of IL-17A, a key cytokine for host protective immunity against O. Ostertagi.",PMC4941725,PMC4941725_1
"In a separate study using mice, the authors discovered that a vaccine against the parasitic nematode Heligmoscoides bakeri containing naphthoquinone (napq) as an adjuvant induced a mixed interleukin (IL)-4- and IL-12-dominant response.",PMC4941725,PMC4941725_2
The authors also observed that the vaccine stimulated the production of IL-17A in the mice.,PMC4941725,PMC4941725_3

"In a study using cattle, the authors found that the vaccine against Ostertagia ostertagi containing naphthoquinone (napq) as an adjuvant stimulated the production of IL-6, IL-12, and IL-17A in peripheral blood leukocytes.",PMC4941725,PMC4941725_8
