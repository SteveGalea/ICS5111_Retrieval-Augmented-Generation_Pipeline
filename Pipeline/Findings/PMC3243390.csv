"In the section on ""Schistosomiasis Transmission in the Yangtze Delta, China,"" the study found that only three of the 10 villages were able to sustain transmission without external inputs. This suggests the importance of connectivity in both endemic and re-emergent circumstances. The study also highlighted the need for a sensitive, cheap, and robust water monitoring procedure for the measurement of parasite concentration in surface waters, as this would allow estimation of the sum of ce(t) and me(t), as well as the development of advanced methods to distinguish cercariae from miracidia.",PMC3243390,PMC3243390_0
"In the section on ""Schistosomiasis Transmission in the Yangtze Delta, China,"" the study also noted that the extensive recent use of praziquantel and niclosamide in China has suppressed transmission levels difficult to detect by continued reliance on acute schistosomiasis case reports and episodic surveys for S. japonicum-infected humans and/or snails. For example, in 28 villages that had previously attained control status and were not known to currently support transmission, thorough surveys showed that human prevalence ranged from 0 to 27.8% per cent.",PMC3243390,PMC3243390_1
"In the section on ""Schistosomiasis Transmission in the Yangtze Delta, China,"" the study also observed that the lack of direct data from the field on ce(t), me(t), and the two spatial parameters are the major limitation in assessing the sources driving transmission in a single village. A major step forward in addressing this need would be the development of advanced methods to distinguish cercariae from miracidia in water samples, which would allow estimation of γ and ξ.",PMC3243390,PMC3243390_2
"In the section on ""Schistosomiasis Transmission in the Yangtze Delta, China,"" the study found that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have been published for detection of the parasite, and preliminary work has been carried out in investigating field sampling methods with detection using QPCR methods for other waterborne pathogens, notably in the case of polio virus, also in circumstances, as with schistosomiasis in Sichuan, where human case reports had previously provided the first warning of renewed transmission.",PMC3243390,PMC3243390_3
