"The study identified a total of 1282 proteins in royal jelly, with 284 differentially expressed during hypopharyngeal gland development. Of these, 43 were identified for the first time.",PMC4141115,PMC4141115_0
"Comparison of samples at different stages of hypopharyngeal gland development showed that the majority of differentially expressed proteins were upregulated in older worker groups, indicating a substantial change in protein expression after 3 days.",PMC4141115,PMC4141115_1
"Differentially expressed proteins were identified in all age groups, suggesting that changes in protein expression during hypopharyngeal gland ontogeny are concomitant with different states of worker development.",PMC4141115,PMC4141115_2
Over 10 key high-abundance proteins were involved in signaling pathways related to ribosome function and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum.,PMC4141115,PMC4141115_3
"The study demonstrated that hypopharyngeal glands experienced important changes in protein expression during ontogenic development, supporting the secretion of proteins involved in diverse functions beyond its traditional role in royal jelly production.",PMC4141115,PMC4141115_4
