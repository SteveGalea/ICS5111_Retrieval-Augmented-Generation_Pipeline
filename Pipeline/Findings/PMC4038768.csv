"The hygiene hypothesis proposes that decreased exposure to environmental microorganisms and gut microbiota during childhood has resulted in immunoregulatory failure, contributing to the increased incidence of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations.",PMC4038768,PMC4038768_0
"The agricultural revolution created conditions for the emergence of acute, epidemic, 'crowd' infectious diseases such as smallpox, measles, and pertussis, which were among the chief causes of human morbidity and mortality until the second epidemiologic transition.",PMC4038768,PMC4038768_1
"The intensification of agriculture has brought new infections into human populations through increased exposure to animals, particularly bushmeat hunting, which has provided a highly effective pathway for the transmission of zoonotic pathogens into human populations, both in the past and today.",PMC4038768,PMC4038768_2
The use of antibiotic growth factors in livestock has contributed to the reemergence of previously controlled infectious diseases through the evolution of drug-resistant infections.,PMC4038768,PMC4038768_3
"The agricultural revolution and subsistence practices that increase exposure between humans and animals have increased the probability that nonhuman pathogens will evolve the ability to infect humans, and later, evolve the capacity for sustained transmission within and between human populations.",PMC4038768,PMC4038768_4
