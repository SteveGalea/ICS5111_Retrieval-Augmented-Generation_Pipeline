This study demonstrates that g6pd-deficient epithelial cells are less tolerant to Staphylococcus aureus infection due to impaired removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced apoptotic activity.,PMC3817128,PMC3817128_0
"The study shows that the lack of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), encoded by the g6pd gene, impairs the reconversion of glutathione disulphide to reduced glutathione, leading to an inability to remove excess ROS effectively.",PMC3817128,PMC3817128_1
"The study highlights that the accumulation of ROS in mitochondria, where the majority of ROS are generated, results in stronger cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway in g6pd-deficient cells.",PMC3817128,PMC3817128_2
"The study suggests that Staphylococcus aureus Î±-hemolysin, a major virulence factor of S. Aureus, contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction through the accumulation of ROS in g6pd-deficient cells.",PMC3817128,PMC3817128_3
"The study indicates that the misuse of antibiotics in other drug-resistant strains may trigger the expression of other exotoxins that can cause stronger oxidative stress in g6pd-deficient cells, although the susceptibility of different cell types to bacterial virulence factors is variable.",PMC3817128,PMC3817128_4
