"The study found that the arrival time pattern of patients in the emergency outpatient department (eopd) of the study institution is highly random, with a peak hour of 9:00-12:00.",PMC4126114,PMC4126114_0
"The study revealed that the majority (70%) of patients in the eopd were male, and around 28% were in the age group of 45-59 years followed by 24.7% in the age group of 15-29 years.",PMC4126114,PMC4126114_1
"The study showed that the majority (29.6%) of patients in the eopd were waiting ""under observation"" after preliminary diagnosis by the physician, with a median waiting time of 16 hours.",PMC4126114,PMC4126114_2
"The study found that waiting of around 71% of patients in the eopd was attributed to factors within the eopd itself, while waiting of around 26% patients was attributed to reasons outside the eopd but within the hospital.",PMC4126114,PMC4126114_3
"The study indicated that the factors influencing the patient flow do not lie solely in the eopd, although waiting of at least three-fourths of all the patients can be explained by the reasons lying in the eopd complex itself.",PMC4126114,PMC4126114_4
