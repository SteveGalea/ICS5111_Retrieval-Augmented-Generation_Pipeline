"The study found that lozenges containing carrageenan were highly effective against all viruses tested, with a minimum superiority of 2- to 1368-fold for human rhinovirus type 14 (HRV14) and human coronavirus oc43 (HCovOC43), respectively.",PMC5339006,PMC5339006_0
"The study also found that the antiviral effect of lozenges containing aminomethylpropanol (AMP) and dicyclohexyl (DCH) or hydroxyethylcellulose (HR) varied widely, depending on the specific formulation of the lozenges and the virus causing the sore throat.",PMC5339006,PMC5339006_1
"The study determined the average time needed for complete dissolution of a lozenge in the mouth to be 13.34 Â± 2.34 minutes, and found that the amount of carrageenan liberated from the lozenge during this time was sufficient to guarantee antiviral activity throughout the entire dissolution process.",PMC5339006,PMC5339006_2
"The study also determined the binding kinetics of representative influenza virus A (H1N1) and HCovOC43 to iota-carrageenan beads using an ha assay and found that within the first 3 minutes, the viral load was reduced by 57% and 82%, respectively, and within 10 minutes by 72% and 91% for H1N1 and HCovOC43, respectively.",PMC5339006,PMC5339006_3
"The study found that the viral load dropped below the detection limit after 20 minutes of lozenge dissolution for both H1N1 and HCovOC43, indicating that iota-carrageenan containing lozenges are an appropriate measure to effectively reduce the number of viral particles in the mouth.",PMC5339006,PMC5339006_4
"The study also noted that the antiviral effect of lozenges containing AMP and DCH or HR varied widely depending on the specific virus causing the sore throat, and questioned their suitability for use as causative therapy in a clinical setting due to this variability.",PMC5339006,PMC5339006_5
"The study found that the viral load for HRV14 was reduced by 57% and 82% within the first 3 minutes, and by 72% and 91%",PMC5339006,PMC5339006_6
