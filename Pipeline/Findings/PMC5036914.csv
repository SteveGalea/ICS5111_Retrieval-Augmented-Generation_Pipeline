"A retrospective analysis of respiratory viral infections (RVIs) after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) found that universal surgical mask usage, which requires all individuals in inpatient and outpatient HSCT facilities with direct patient contact to wear surgical masks regardless of symptoms or season, is associated with a significant decrease in clinically significant RVIs, particularly piv3.",PMC5036914,PMC5036914_0
The study also found that compliance with hand hygiene and contact and droplet isolation policies for symptomatic patients did not significantly impact the duration or severity of RVI outbreaks.,PMC5036914,PMC5036914_1
"The analysis showed that graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and myeloablative conditioning were associated with more RVIs, while myeloablative conditioning was associated with fewer RVIs.",PMC5036914,PMC5036914_2
"The study found that RVIs are most common in the spring and summer months, with a significant decrease in RVIs observed in the mask period.",PMC5036914,PMC5036914_3
"The authors noted that differences in detection methods in the premask period (predominantly viral culture and dfa) versus the postmask period (PCR) could impact the results, with PCR being at least 30% more sensitive at detecting viral pathogens compared with DFA and culture, depending on the pathogen, without sacrificing specificity.",PMC5036914,PMC5036914_4
