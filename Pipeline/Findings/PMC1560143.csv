"The study found that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) contributed significantly to influenza-like illness, particularly in young children, in four European countries during the 2002-2003 winter season.",PMC1560143,PMC1560143_0
"The study suggests that RSV should be reported in addition to influenza, as RSV has a significant impact on respiratory illness in Europe.",PMC1560143,PMC1560143_1
The study recommends that respiratory specimens collected as part of an influenza surveillance programme should also be tested for RSV.,PMC1560143,PMC1560143_2
The study recommends that both combined nose and throat swabs and nasal pharyngeal aspirates are acceptable for RSV diagnosis.,PMC1560143,PMC1560143_3
"The study recommends that the application of molecular techniques such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the diagnosis of respiratory disease, including RSV, has been demonstrated and is recommended.",PMC1560143,PMC1560143_4
The study recommends that further developments on the use of standardized methods and laboratory techniques for RSV diagnosis should be considered.,PMC1560143,PMC1560143_5
The study recommends that the development of a sentinel approach of representative hospitals should be considered for RSV surveillance.,PMC1560143,PMC1560143_6
The study recommends that the new networks joining EISS should integrate RSV surveillance alongside influenza.,PMC1560143,PMC1560143_7
"The study suggests that discrepancies in positivity rates for RSV between countries may reflect several factors, including sampling bias and differences in laboratory methods and diagnostic criteria.",PMC1560143,PMC1560143_8
