"As of June 2014, MERS-CoV has infected 688 people and killed 282, with no clear source of infection to humans and an epidemiologic pattern that is more sporadic than the classic epidemic pattern of SARS.",PMC4068970,PMC4068970_0
"MERS-CoV has been identified in camels, but the mode of transmission to humans remains unknown, and many cases have no history of animal contact.",PMC4068970,PMC4068970_1

"Emerging infectious diseases, such as MERS-CoV, are a constant threat to human health due to their uncertainty associated with their early stages and potentially high impact outcome.",PMC4068970,PMC4068970_3
"Ongoing investigation is warranted to address the remaining unanswered questions and unusual features of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV, including the identification of possible zoonotic hosts or environmental sources, the detection of asymptomatic or mild infections, and the possibility of a large number of cases having escaped detection.",PMC4068970,PMC4068970_4
