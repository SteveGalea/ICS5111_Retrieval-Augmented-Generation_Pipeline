The study found that the frequency of the GG genotype of the CD209 (DEN2) rs4804803 polymorphism was significantly higher in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) than in patients with dengue fever (DF) or in healthy controls.,PMC3014977,PMC3014977_0
"The study demonstrated that monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from individuals with the CD209 (DEN2) rs4804803 AG genotype had higher surface expression of CD209 and produced higher levels of cytokines, including interleukin-12p40 and interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), compared to MDDCS from individuals with the AA genotype.",PMC3014977,PMC3014977_1
"The study found that MDDCS from individuals with the CD209 (DEN2) rs4804803 AG genotype had lower dengue virus (DEN2) replication following infection, and this effect was enhanced by the addition of an anti-IP-10 neutralizing antibody.",PMC3014977,PMC3014977_2
"The study suggested that the CD209 (DEN2) rs4804803 polymorphism is involved in the susceptibility to DHF, compared to DF or healthy controls, and that the correlation of viral replication to higher or lower CD209 expression depends on genetic factors in the host, cell type, and dynamic changes in the receptor following DEN2 infection.",PMC3014977,PMC3014977_3
"The study highlighted the potential clinical implications of screening genotypes to prevent DEN2 infection, particularly in future outbreaks of DEN2, given the finding that different viral loads could be demonstrated among humans with various genotypes of CD209 (DEN2) rs4804803 in the context of DEN2 infection.",PMC3014977,PMC3014977_4
