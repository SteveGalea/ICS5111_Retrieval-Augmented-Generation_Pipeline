Tumv-induced vesicles are dynamic structures with irregular shapes and sizes ranging from 0.6 to 4.3 Î¼m in diameter. Some are highly motile with unidirectional movement and stop-and-go activity.,PMC2928320,PMC2928320_0
Vesicles co-align with microfilaments and require active transport due to high cytoplasmic viscosity. Inhibition of microfilament polymerization with latrunculin B stops vesicle movement and significantly decreases virus production.,PMC2928320,PMC2928320_1
"Viral proteins are imported into the factories, with translation assumed to occur in the cytoplasm and proteins exported randomly to vesicles. However, translation instead occurs within the factories or is tightly associated with them, as many translation factors have been found within the tumv-induced vesicles.",PMC2928320,PMC2928320_2
"A cis mechanism incorporates proteins synthesized from a single viral genome into each vesicle, indicating that translation and replication occur within tumv-induced vesicles. This is supported by the co-localization of viral double-stranded RNA and host translation factors.",PMC2928320,PMC2928320_3
"Viral replication and translation are coupled within tumv-induced vesicles, with viral proteins accumulating in patches on the outer endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, initiating membrane curvature. A switch then happens from translation to replication, allowing for viral RNA synthesis within the same vesicles. Clusters of large vesicles are produced during a second budding from the ER.",PMC2928320,PMC2928320_4
