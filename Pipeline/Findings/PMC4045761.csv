The study found that the silver salt of sucrose octasulfate (iasos) has antimicrobial properties against bacterial and yeast pathogens commonly found in women with symptomatic vaginitis.,PMC4045761,PMC4045761_0
"The study demonstrated that iasos, the patented silver salt of sucrose octasulfate, displayed antimicrobial activity against a number of bacterial strains involved in the onset of symptomatic vaginitis, as well as against the yeast Candida albicans, responsible for one of the most frequent vaginal fungal infections.",PMC4045761,PMC4045761_1
"The study showed that the vaginal gel formulation containing iasos, silsos femme, displayed important antimicrobial effects against bacterial and yeast pathogens, suggesting a potential role of this novel formulation in the prevention and/or treatment of feminine vaginal infections as an adjunct to drug therapy.",PMC4045761,PMC4045761_2
"The study found that the antimicrobial activity of the vaginal gel silsos femme against bacterial and yeast pathogens was dependent on the final concentration of available silver ions, with an amount as high as 32 mg per cm2 being necessary to achieve a visible inhibition of microbial growth in the study's experimental conditions.",PMC4045761,PMC4045761_3
"The study suggested that other ingredients into the gel formulation, such as ksos and hya, may synergize iasosâ€™s antimicrobial activity through their antiadhesion properties.",PMC4045761,PMC4045761_4
