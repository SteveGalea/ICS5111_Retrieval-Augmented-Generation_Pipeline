"The study demonstrated that the sars-cov plpro, a viral polyprotein processing enzyme, can deubiquitinate substrates, thereby protecting proteins from degradation by the proteasome. This is important because deubiquitination is a widespread mechanism used by cells to target proteins for degradation by the proteasome, and the sars-cov plpro may increase the stability and steady-state level of host and/or viral proteins.",PMC1316033,PMC1316033_0
"The study also showed that the sars-cov plpro can disassemble branched polyubiquitin chains, which are involved in protein targeting for degradation by the proteasome. This is significant because it implies that the sars-cov plpro may de-isgylate protein conjugates, as isoglutamine and isoglutamine-vinyl sulfone share the same c-terminal sequence.",PMC1316033,PMC1316033_1
"The study found that the sars-cov plpro is inhibited by the specific deubiquitinating enzyme inhibitor ubal, with a ki value of 210 nm. This is important because it establishes that the deubiquitinating activity of sars-cov plpro is regulated, which can lead to an additional level of functional complexity to this enzyme and elevate its value as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",PMC1316033,PMC1316033_2
"The study identified substrates from cells infected by the sars-cov virus, which confirms that deubiquitination is operative in the context of a sars-cov infection. This is significant because it provides insights into processes taking place at the molecular level during viral infection, which can improve our understanding of how to treat sars and related viruses.",PMC1316033,PMC1316033_3
"The study showed that the sars-cov plpro, which is located in nsp3, the replicase complex, could also deubiquitinate host or viral proteins. This is important because it adds an additional level of functional complexity to this enzyme and highlights the need for continued investigation of sars-cov plpro functions to improve our understanding of processes taking place at the molecular level during viral infection.",PMC1316033,PMC1316033_4
