"Intranasal injection of fmomv, a complex of various toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, provides broad-spectrum protection against diverse influenza virus strains, as early as 3 days after administration, by eliciting activation of macrophages and inducing antiviral molecular milieu in the lungs.",PMC6738265,PMC6738265_0
"Fmomv injection leads to an increase and activation of macrophages, resulting in the recruitment of bone marrow-derived macrophages to the lungs, and these macrophages are indispensable for the antiviral effect of fmomv, as they suppress viral replication after influenza virus infection.",PMC6738265,PMC6738265_1
"Fmomv injection induces the secretion of cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1Î² and type I interferons (IFNs), in the lung tissue, and these cytokines play an important role in the protection against influenza virus infection by both inhibiting viral replication and suppressing excessive tissue inflammation.",PMC6738265,PMC6738265_2
"Fmomv injection does not require neutrophils for antiviral activities provided by fmomv, as infiltrated macrophages have sufficiently suppressed disease severity after influenza virus infection, and viral load and inflammatory cytokines may have been insufficient to activate neutrophils to produce antiviral molecules after influenza virus infection in fmomv-injected mice.",PMC6738265,PMC6738265_3
"Fmomv, a complex of various TLR ligands, leads to higher protective efficacy against diverse influenza virus strains, as it presumably simultaneously activates TLRs and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, whereas a single TLR ligand or simultaneous activation of TLR2 and TLR9 provides differential protective efficacy against different virus strains.",PMC6738265,PMC6738265_4
