"This study confirmed that the Ebola virus entry factor, tim-1, and the Marburg virus entry factor, axl, augment entry into susceptible cell lines, but their expression is dispensable for Ebola virus infection of macrophages.",PMC4564540,PMC4564540_0
"The study found that less axl and tim-1 mRNA is produced in monocyte-derived macrophages (mdms) compared with susceptible cell lines, indicating that lack of expression does not account for the resistance of mdms to gp-driven entry.",PMC4564540,PMC4564540_1
"The study revealed that expression of the mannose-specific lectin, mer, but not axl, is required for efficient gp-driven transduction and Ebola virus infection of mdms.",PMC4564540,PMC4564540_2
"The study found that sirnas against integrin Î±v and sr-a reduced gp-driven entry into mdms and Ebola virus infection of mdms, suggesting that other factors, besides mer, might contribute to these processes in macrophages.",PMC4564540,PMC4564540_3
"The study suggested that sr-a is expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells and contributes to the macrophage uptake of a broad spectrum of ligands, including apoptotic cells, and that Ebola virus glycoprotein (gp)-driven transduction of mdms was also inhibited by tannic acid and fucoidan, sr-a ligands, arguing for a role of sr-a in entry of Ebola viruses into macrophages.",PMC4564540,PMC4564540_4
