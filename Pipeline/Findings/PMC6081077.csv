"The study found that the annual primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) rate increased by 202.56% in Taiwan from 1996 to 2010, with a higher rate in women.",PMC6081077,PMC6081077_0
"The study showed that the annual primary TKA rate presented a rising tendency with increases in patient age, similar to other studies in Western countries and the Asian area, with a high rate in the 70 to 79 age group.",PMC6081077,PMC6081077_1
"The study revealed that the mean age of patients undergoing TKA has risen, and advances in medical management of osteoarthritis (OA) may mean patients postpone joint replacement surgery, leading to an incremental rise in the mean age of patients receiving TKA.",PMC6081077,PMC6081077_2
"The study found that the annual incidence rate of TKA was higher in women than in men, with a ratio of 2.5 to 3 times larger in Taiwan, slightly greater than that of previous studies in Western countries and the Asian area.",PMC6081077,PMC6081077_3
"The study demonstrated that the alos for TKA markedly declined from 1996 to 2010, with a small peak in the cost and the mean length of stay for TKA in 1999, and the mean cost per patient and alos also fell slowly from 1996 to 2010, possibly due to advances in medical technology and sciences.",PMC6081077,PMC6081077_4
