"The study found that a single amino acid substitution at position 156 in the heavy chain of the HLA-A*24 allele, commonly associated with autoimmune disorders and viral infections, can influence the presentation of peptides by the HLA class I molecule, resulting in altered peptide repertoire and structure.",PMC4353853,PMC4353853_0
"The study demonstrated that HLA-A*24:06 and HLA-A*24:13, which contain amino acid substitutions at position 156, are more independent of the tapasin (tpn) component of the peptide loading complex (PLC) than HLA-A*24:02. This suggests that they have increased stability in the absence of tpn and present a more peptide receptive environment, potentially allowing the presentation of non-optimized ligands with unusual length during viral infections.",PMC4353853,PMC4353853_1
"The study also found that other known tpn independent alleles, such as HLA-B*44, demonstrate increased protein stability.",PMC4353853,PMC4353853_2
"The study highlights the need for a systematic analysis to understand the impact of HLA mismatches, as differences in both tpn dependency and peptide repertoire for variants with single mismatches at residue 156 described in both the B*44 and A*24 groups may have implications for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).",PMC4353853,PMC4353853_3
"The study suggests that the presentation of unusual ligands by tpn independent alleles could be considered an overlooked factor that may need to be considered more carefully during donor selection for HSCT, as it represents an advantage for viral immunity but could also be considered disadvantageous due to the presentation of non-optimized ligands.",PMC4353853,PMC4353853_4
