"A new approach for assembly and linkage of viral genomes from metagenomes has been developed, which overcomes challenges associated with low similarity to viral sequences in databases, uneven coverage of target genomes, and intrapopulation diversity or sequencing errors leading to incomplete contigs. This approach consists of four steps: assembly, identification, linkage, and finalizing.",PMC4589665,PMC4589665_0
"The assembly step involves selecting an assembler suited for the sequencing technique and read length, and making use of paired-end information to combine assemblies or assemblers to increase the length of contigs.",PMC4589665,PMC4589665_1
The identification step involves using motif search to detect conserved regions and remote homology detection methods to link fragments.,PMC4589665,PMC4589665_2
"The finalizing step involves determining the order of fragments by generating overlaps between contigs, and editing contig ends to improve wrong assemblies and facilitate subsequent gap closing with a different assembler.",PMC4589665,PMC4589665_3
"The success of assembly and linkage depends on the presence of sufficient sequencing data of the target genome, the quality of sample preparation and sequencing protocols, and the selection of an appropriate assembler and motif search methods.",PMC4589665,PMC4589665_4
"Successful assembly and linkage require long contigs (>1 kb) produced by the assembly, as motif search and coverage and k-mer profile analysis perform better on long fragments due to the noise associated with the high numbers of features in case of k-mers or introduced by uneven coverage.",PMC4589665,PMC4589665_5
"To effectively use k-mer profiles, coverage profile binning, and motif search to link fragments, it is advisable to apply these methods only to well-assembled, long fragments.",PMC4589665,PMC4589665_6
The development of efficient and dedicated metagenome assemblers that consider the characteristics of viromes and viral genomes is needed to directly recover full-length viral genomes from metagenomes.,PMC4589665,PMC4589665_7
"The approach has been successfully applied to recover full-length viral genomes from metagenomes, such as the complete genome of the gram-negative bacterium rickettsia prowazekii, which had an unresolvable 5' end.",PMC4589665,PMC4589665_8
"However, in some cases, even with sufficient sequencing data and coverage, viral genomes cannot be completely resolved in silico due to fragmentation of the RNA in the original tissue,",PMC4589665,PMC4589665_9
