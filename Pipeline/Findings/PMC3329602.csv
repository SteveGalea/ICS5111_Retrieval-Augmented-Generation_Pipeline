Baculovirus-mediated stimulation of innate immunity provides protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in mice without vaccine-induced immunopathology.,PMC3329602,PMC3329602_0
Intranasal inoculation of baculovirus displaying the g protein of RSV in mice induces antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity against RSV infection and provides complete protection against RSV challenge without vaccine-induced diseases.,PMC3329602,PMC3329602_1
"The levels of RSV-specific th2-biased responses, which are responsible for vaccine-enhanced diseases, are very low in the lungs of baculovirus-immunized mice following RSV challenge.",PMC3329602,PMC3329602_2
"Baculovirus-mediated stimulation of innate immunity, exhibiting strong adjuvanticity, can act as a safe and effective vaccine carrier due to its ability to stimulate strong innate immunity responses and its lack of pre-existing vector immunity against baculovirus in mammals.",PMC3329602,PMC3329602_3
"Baculovirus-mediated stimulation of innate immunity, exhibiting strong adjuvanticity, can provide strong evidence that baculovirus-based vaccines could be further developed as safe and effective mucosal vaccines against respiratory viral infections.",PMC3329602,PMC3329602_4
