"The study aimed to develop a molecular-based therapy against feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus, which is highly conserved among different feline species, by designing circular triple helix forming oligonucleotides (tfo) that target specific regions of the FIP virus genome.",PMC3950953,PMC3950953_0
"The study demonstrated that all circular tfo, except for tfo2, were able to inhibit FIP virus replication by binding to specific target regions of the FIP virus genome, showing significant reductions in viral rna genome copy numbers compared with virus-infected cells.",PMC3950953,PMC3950953_1
The study found that the reason for the lack of antiviral properties for linear tfo and unrelated circular tfo7 rna was probably due to the length of these tfo being insufficient to form functional triplex structures upon hybridization or the failure to form functional triplex structures upon hybridization.,PMC3950953,PMC3950953_2
"The study also found that the binding affinity of circular tfo to its target region, measured by nanoitc analysis, showed low dissociation constant (kd) values and high stability, allowing the tfos to compete effectively with the target regions for inhibiting transcription in cell-free systems.",PMC3950953,PMC3950953_3
"The study suggests that the circular tfo has the potential to be developed as a therapy against FIP in cats, but further studies on tfo specificity, actual mechanism of circular tfo rna in transcription alteration consequence of inhibiting the viral transcription process, and in vivo animal studies are important for this approach to work as a therapy in the future.",PMC3950953,PMC3950953_4
