"A study conducted in four provincial hospitals in Vietnam evaluated the performance of the Luminex XTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Fast V2 assay in detecting multiple respiratory viral pathogens in nasal and throat swabs. The study found that the overall positivity of Luminex among reference assays was high (91.8%, CI 95% 88.1-94.7) and that Luminex was superior to reference assays for detecting entero/rhinovirus and human pareinfluenza virus type 4.",PMC5811805,PMC5811805_0
"The study revealed that Luminex had a significantly higher detection rate for human pareinfluenza virus type 4 than reference assays (p=0.01), while detection rates for influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus were confirmed by single-RT PCR (number of +L/-ref cases ranged from 3 to 69; Table 2).",PMC5811805,PMC5811805_1
"The study also found that the Luminex assay had a lower positivity rate for human bocavirus than reference assays (p=0.04), which may require further clinical evaluation.",PMC5811805,PMC5811805_2
"The study suggested that the Luminex assay, with its fast turnaround time, could contribute to improving patient management and changing prescription culture in countries like Vietnam, where empiric antibiotic prescription is common due to the fear of clinical worsening for patients with acute respiratory infection.",PMC5811805,PMC5811805_3
"The study acknowledged limitations, including the lack of a true gold standard as a diagnostic test and low numbers of positive samples for several 'uncommon' viruses, which may conceal true diagnostic rates for these viruses.",PMC5811805,PMC5811805_4
