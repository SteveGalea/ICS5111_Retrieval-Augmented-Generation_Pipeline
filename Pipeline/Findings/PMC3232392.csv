"Apoptosis and necrosis were detected in the early and late ngvev-infection phase, respectively, in various organs of goose, with apoptotic cells appearing more frequently in the lymphoid and digestive organs.",PMC3232392,PMC3232392_0
"The presence and quantity of apoptotic cells increased with infection time until 9 days pi, and necrosis of the host cells occurred, especially in the epithelia and some lymphocytes.",PMC3232392,PMC3232392_1
"Apoptotic lymphocytes were firstly detected in the ngvev-infected goose, while necrosis was later detected in the epithelia and some lymphocytes.",PMC3232392,PMC3232392_2
"The apoptotic depletion of lymphocytes by ngvev may be partially mediated by the mechanism of apoptotic cells disruption of the lymphocytic microenvironment, similar to the one proposed for HIV-related thymocyte depletion.",PMC3232392,PMC3232392_3
"Apoptosis and necrosis of host cells in vivo may contribute to the pathogenesis of ngvev, resulting in a series of functional disorders of the digestive system and clinical symptoms, as well as a series of secondary pathological changes in the central and peripheral immune organs after ngvev infection.",PMC3232392,PMC3232392_4
