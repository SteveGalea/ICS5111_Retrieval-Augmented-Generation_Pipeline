"During the SARS outbreak in California from March to July 2003, 73 out of 165 patients had a pathogen identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, and serologic tests.",PMC3323182,PMC3323182_0
"RT-PCR was the most sensitive diagnostic method, identifying a likely causal agent in 41% of patients with suspect SARS cases and 32% of patients with probable SARS cases.",PMC3323182,PMC3323182_1
"Serologic testing identified a likely etiologic agent in specimens from an additional 6 patients who met the SARS criteria, including 3 with suspect SARS cases and 3 with probable SARS cases.",PMC3323182,PMC3323182_2
"HMPV, whose role in SARS-CoV infection remains undefined, was detected by PCR in four patients with suspect SARS cases and two patients with probable SARS cases.",PMC3323182,PMC3323182_3
"Determining a commonly recognized cause for an influenza-like illness allowed cases to be removed from the suspect or probable SARS categories, alleviating the required epidemiologic investigation, hospitalization or isolation, strict infection control precautions, and additional specimen collection and contact tracing.",PMC3323182,PMC3323182_4
