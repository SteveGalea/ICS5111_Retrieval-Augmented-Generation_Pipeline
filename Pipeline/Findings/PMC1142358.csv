"This study demonstrates that hcov-nl63, a less pathogenic coronavirus, utilizes the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV.",PMC1142358,PMC1142358_0
"The study reveals that hcov-nl63 infection is more prevalent than infection with another closely related coronavirus, HCoV-229E, as virtually all sera from adults potently neutralized hcov-nl63-mediated infection but not 229E-mediated infection.",PMC1142358,PMC1142358_1
"The study suggests that the mode of ACE2 engagement by the viral spike (S) proteins impacts viral replication and pathogenesis, as hcov-nl63- and SARS-CoV-S bind less efficiently to murine ACE2 than human ACE2.",PMC1142358,PMC1142358_2
"The study highlights the need for efficient vaccines against hcovs, as pathogenic hcovs can evolve, due to the apparent similarities between hcov-nl63 and SARS-CoV replication and the frequent hcov-nl63 infection of humans.",PMC1142358,PMC1142358_3
"The study suggests that hcov-nl63 and SARS-CoV-S interactions with ACE2 might have important implications for inhibitor development, as the s-ACE2 interface is a major target for therapeutic intervention, due to the similarities between hcov-nl63 and SARS-CoV replication.",PMC1142358,PMC1142358_4
