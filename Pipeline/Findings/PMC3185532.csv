The human protein kinase M (p38M) is required for the innate immune response and the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) through the inhibition of activation of the interferon (IFN)-regulated transmembrane protein (IFRTM) and the modulation of sumoylation machinery [129-132].,PMC3185532,PMC3185532_0
The Ebola virus (EV) VP35 protein serves as an antagonist of p38M-mediated activation of p38M and the inhibition of activation of the IFN-response factor 3 (IRF3) through the inhibition of activation of the IFN-regulated transmembrane protein (IFRTM) and the modulation of sumoylation machinery [135-138].,PMC3185532,PMC3185532_1
"The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) m142 and m143 genes, which belong to the same gene family as the EV VP35 genes, act as p38M inhibitors, but, in contrast to p38M/m143, both proteins are needed for inhibition [148].",PMC3185532,PMC3185532_2
"Many RNA and DNA virus families have acquired one or more gene product(s) that reduce the induction of the latent kinase p38M or phosphorylation of its substrate eIF2Î± by very diverse mechanisms, and research in the past decade has revealed that the capacity to antagonize this cellular defense is an important aspect of the virulence and/or host specificity of these viral pathogens [151,152].",PMC3185532,PMC3185532_3
"Recent evidence suggests that the capacity to antagonize this cellular defense is an important aspect of the virulence and/or host specificity of these viral pathogens, and there is evidence for rapid evolution of p38M genes in primates and positive selection at specific amino acid sites, supporting the view that this kinase evolves under the constant pressure of antagonistic viral gene functions [151,152].",PMC3185532,PMC3185532_4
