"Plakortide E, a metabolite from the marine sponge Plakortis Halichondroides, exhibits anti-protease and anti-parasitic activity.",PMC4052307,PMC4052307_0
"Plakortide E selectively inhibits cathepsin-like cysteine proteases, including rhodesain, with a non-competitive, reversible, and slow-binding inhibitory mode of action.",PMC4052307,PMC4052307_1
"Plakortide E shows anti-parasitic activity against Trypanosoma brucei, potentially due to its inhibitory effect on rhodesain and cathepsin b-like protease tbcatb, which are essential for parasite growth and pathogenicity.",PMC4052307,PMC4052307_2
"Plakortide E is isolated from crude extracts of Plakortis Halichondroides through bioactivity-guided fractionation, and its structure is confirmed through NMR and MS spectroscopy.",PMC4052307,PMC4052307_3
"Plakortide E shows trypanocidal activity against Trypanosoma brucei with an IC50 value of 5 µM. It does not exhibit activity against Leishmania major promastigotes, potentially due to lower expression of cysteine proteases in these forms. Additionally, Plakortide E does not show activity against Candida albicans or have cytotoxic effects against J774.1 macrophages at 100 µM.",PMC4052307,PMC4052307_4
