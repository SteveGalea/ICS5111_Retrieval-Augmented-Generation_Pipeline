"This study identified that the general public in Melbourne, Australia had a good understanding of the clinical features of pandemic influenza and of the precautions required to minimize its spread in the community. Health literacy and behavior change were reportedly well emphasized in the dhs campaign. However, 70% of respondents thought that pregnant women and indigenous groups were not vulnerable groups, despite being central dhs messages at the onset of the outbreak and during vaccination campaigns.",PMC3502135,PMC3502135_0
"The study showed that 85% of respondents believed that the government and media had provided sufficient information about pandemic influenza, but that the message was repetitive and led to loss of interest in the issue. ""Pandemic fatigue"" is of concern because it may lead to decreased risk perception and may explain the attitude of the study's participants towards government and media on the matter.",PMC3502135,PMC3502135_1
"The study found that only 40% of respondents intended to adhere to government recommendations in case of a future pandemic, and that only 40% of respondents believed that future pandemics would be serious enough to mandate preventative measures. Campaigns should address the feeling of exaggeration and the loss of interest to ensure prompt compliance with pandemic measures.",PMC3502135,PMC3502135_2
"The study showed that only 20% of respondents had received the new vaccine, despite 80% knowing about it. This is consistent with Kamate's study on SARS in India, where only 16% of the population would want to be vaccinated.",PMC3502135,PMC3502135_3
"The study found that use of traditional mass media was prevalent, whereas new technology such as Twitter updates was not. The use of the internet, mainly composed of viewing online newspapers, was higher than other pandemic studies. For example, Kim's study on SARS in 2003 showed only 3% of the population had access to the internet to find out about the disease. It is surprising that higher results were not obtained for newer forms of communication since this sample was composed of relatively young people with a median age of 36. Thus, it would appear that future campaigns should still emphasize traditional modes of communication.",PMC3502135,PMC3502135_4
