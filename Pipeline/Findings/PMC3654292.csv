"The study identified chloroquine diphosphate as the primary risk factor for herpes zoster (Hz) in dermatomyositis (DM)/polymyositis (PM) patients, with patients using this drug having a fivefold greater risk of developing Hz compared to patients not receiving chloroquine diphosphate treatment, independent of disease status, therapy, and demographic features.",PMC3654292,PMC3654292_0
"The study found a high prevalence of Hz in the DM/PM population studied, with Hz predominantly affecting adult patients with a mean age of 44 years (range 21 to 84 years), and no tendency toward affecting older individuals.",PMC3654292,PMC3654292_1
"The study showed that Hz prevalence was independent of disease status, clinical and laboratory features, including cutaneous manifestations, and that using corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide, and cyclophosphamide)—either alone or in combination—was not associated with Hz development in this population.",PMC3654292,PMC3654292_2
"The study identified female sex as a risk factor for Hz development, as Hz predominantly affected women, with no tendency toward affecting older individuals.",PMC3654292,PMC3654292_3
"The study found that at least half of the patients had neurological sequelae, with postherpetic neuralgia resulting in severe pain such that patients are often unable to wear clothing that comes in contact with the lesions or be exposed to wind because of high skin sensitivity in regions such as the thorax and face, and that short-term use of corticosteroids can reduce the pain severity and improve patient quality of life in the acute phase.",PMC3654292,PMC3654292_4
