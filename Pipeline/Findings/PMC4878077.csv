"Sav3 infection downregulates multiple genes of the jak/stat pathway, which could be an immune evasion strategy to prevent antiviral gene transcription and interfere with viral replication in to-cells.",PMC4878077,PMC4878077_0
"In the absence of type I IFN treatment, Sav3 downregulates several jak/stat pathway genes, including type I and II receptor genes, jak2, tyk2, STAT3, and STAT5, suggesting possible failure to activate the jak/stat signaling pathway and inhibition of signal transducers caused by Sav3 infection.",PMC4878077,PMC4878077_1
"In type I IFN-treated cells, the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) genes 1 and 3 are upregulated, but only SOCS3 is downregulated in Sav3-infected cells, indicating inhibition of SOCS3 by Sav3 infection in to-cells.",PMC4878077,PMC4878077_2
The study shows that combining de novo assembly with pathway-based transcriptome analyses provides a contextual approach to understanding the molecular networks of genes that form the jak/stat pathway in Sav3-infected to-cells.,PMC4878077,PMC4878077_3
"Sav3 infection suppresses Sav3 structural protein (SP) expression by 2 logs10 at 2 days post-infection compared to Sav3 infection without type I IFN treatment, providing evidence for the impact of type I IFN on Sav3-infected to-cells.",PMC4878077,PMC4878077_4
