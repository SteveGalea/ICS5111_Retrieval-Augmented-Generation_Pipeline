"This retrospective study, conducted over a 3-year period in a French pediatric hospital, highlights significant variations in respiratory viruses' prevalence and distribution among children in hospital settings compared to adults. Children in neonatal units presented lower positivity and viral coinfection rates than children in pediatric units, with an overrepresentation of picornavirus among all populations. In pediatric units, influenza and RSV were never the majority group of viruses identified in children using multiplex PCR (mPCR) or RSV-specific testing, respectively.",PMC5325537,PMC5325537_0
"The study also revealed that even when clinical symptoms led physicians to request RSV-specific testing, only 31.3% of negative RSV-specific tests were positive for another respiratory virus when tested by mPCR. This highlights that RSV testing is badly suited for respiratory viruses' detection in all children populations and may lead to non-optimal care decisions such as unnecessary antibiotic use, laboratory testing, radiological exams, or hospitalisations.",PMC5325537,PMC5325537_1
"The study underlines that the lack of a complete respiratory viruses' detection may lead to non-optimal care decisions such as unnecessary isolation or an underestimation of nosocomial epidemics. A monitoring in real-time of all respiratory viruses, only possible by a larger use of mPCR, may help identify and explore more closely specific epidemics.",PMC5325537,PMC5325537_2
"The study shows that the use of mPCR tests has led to huge improvements in respiratory viruses' detection, allowing better cohorting decisions, especially for severe respiratory viruses such as influenza and RSV, but also para-influenza or metapneumovirus. Viral co-infections, frequent among children, may also be more easily detected, allowing better cohorting decisions.",PMC5325537,PMC5325537_3
"The study emphasises the number of undiagnosed respiratory viruses according to the current diagnosis practice in France and gives a better picture of respiratory viruses identified in hospital settings by mPCR all over the year. These findings are of importance in order to have a better opinion and view of the diagnosis missed by the current practice in France, where only RSV and influenza-specific testing are recommended during epidemic periods, and no testing at all outside these periods.
