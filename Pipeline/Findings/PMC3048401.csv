"A study in Antananarivo, Madagascar found that respiratory viral infections are common in patients presenting with influenza-like illnesses (ILI), with a prevalence of 75.1%. Children under 5 years had the highest prevalence of viral etiology (54.0%) and co-infections (65.2%). RSV was the most common virus in children under 5 years, and HRV was also commonly detected in children. HCV-OC43 and HADV were present in 6.1% and 5.0% of positive specimens, respectively, suggesting their importance as etiological agents in respiratory diseases in Madagascar.",PMC3048401,PMC3048401_0
"The study observed viral co-infections at a rate of 29.4%, which is higher than reported in previous studies. The sensitivity and specificity of molecular assays testing for these fourteen pathogens in respiratory secretions still have some interests in clinical practice.",PMC3048401,PMC3048401_1
"The study showed that HRV, HADV, and HCOV-OC43 can be detected in asymptomatic children, suggesting that some respiratory viruses that were detected might not cause the disease. However, some viruses detected might not be the cause of the disease but rather the co-infection that causes the disease.",PMC3048401,PMC3048401_2
"The viruses temporal patterns detected in this study suggest that some viruses that were detected might not cause the disease but rather the co-infection that causes the disease. This may lead to more appropriate care and treatment of patients, including the correct application of antibiotics.",PMC3048401,PMC3048401_3
"The study found that RSV was more frequently detected during the warm and rainy season from February to May with a peak on March. This is in agreement with observations in other countries with subtropical climate. However, further studies including meteorological parameters are needed to understand if temperature and/or humidity are factors associated with RSV infection in Madagascar.",PMC3048401,PMC3048401_4
