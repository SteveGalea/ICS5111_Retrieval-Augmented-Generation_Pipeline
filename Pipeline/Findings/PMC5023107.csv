"This study, which analyzed infectious complications in 324 pediatric patients with high-risk solid tumors who underwent tandem hdct/auto-sct, found that the frequency and severity of infectious complications in the second hdct/auto-sct were not higher than in the first hdct/auto-sct. However, the second hdct/auto-sct did not significantly reduce the incidence of bacteremia, and the incidence of mdr bacteria, particularly esbl-producing Escherichia coli, appeared to increase over time.",PMC5023107,PMC5023107_0
"The study found that the incidence of infectious complications during the late transplant period after hdct/auto-sct was lower than seen in previous reports for adults and similar to reports in other childhood cohorts, most of whom underwent single hdct/auto-sct. However, most infectious complications in the late transplant period occurred during the first 6 months after the second hdct/auto-sct, and most isolated organisms were gram-positive bacteria.",PMC5023107,PMC5023107_1
"The study showed that the incidence and severity of infectious complications in the second hdct/auto-sct were not higher than in the first hdct/auto-sct. However, the incidence of lrti was relatively low compared to previous studies, but most patients who experienced lrti in the late transplant period had indwelling central venous catheters at the time of infection, and most isolated organisms were gram-positive bacteria.",PMC5023107,PMC5023107_2
"The study suggested that earlier removal of central venous catheter could reduce the risk of bacteremia in the late transplant period after hdct/auto-sct. However, careful immune surveillance should be continued until at least 6 months post-transplant.",PMC5023107,PMC5023107_3
"The study showed that the incidence and severity of infectious complications in the second hdct/auto-sct were not higher than in the first hdct/auto-sct. However, the incidence of vzv reactivation was relatively low compared to previous studies, but most patients who experienced vzv reactivation in the late transplant period were sero-positive for vzv prior to hdct/auto-",PMC5023107,PMC5023107_4
