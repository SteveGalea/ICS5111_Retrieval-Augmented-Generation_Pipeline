"The study presents a sirs network model to describe the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic, which reveals that the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic are closely related to three parameters: the fluctuation of the infection rate, the small infection probability in nature, and the average degree of network.",PMC4629194,PMC4629194_0
"The study suggests that a persistent is necessary to ignite another outbreak, and it is also consistent with practical cases where there is always a small possibility for infected seeds to be generated naturally.",PMC4629194,PMC4629194_1
"The study suggests that reducing the natural infection probability from the environment or unknown reasons can help control the recurrent outbreaks, as individuals may have different habitus and thus may need different times to recover.",PMC4629194,PMC4629194_2
"The study suggests that increasing the contagious rate of infection can also help control the recurrent outbreaks, as it provides sufficient susceptible people to induce an outbreak.",PMC4629194,PMC4629194_3
"The study suggests that an effective way to control the recurrent outbreaks can be found by considering these three factors, as they work together to generate the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic.",PMC4629194,PMC4629194_4
