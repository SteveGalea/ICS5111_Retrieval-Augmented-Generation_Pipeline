"The study demonstrates the feasibility of measuring respiratory droplets produced during talking and coughing without using a food dye, as using a food dye can significantly increase the number and mass of droplets.",PMC2843952,PMC2843952_0
"The glass slide method, although time-consuming, shows promise in measuring respiratory droplets as it captures part of the droplets expelled, and scanning and analyzing the droplet stain marks provide more information about respiratory droplets produced by healthy subjects.",PMC2843952,PMC2843952_1
"More droplets were generated when food dye was used, but there was no significant difference in size distributions of droplets produced when food dye was used or not used, nor between talking and coughing.",PMC2843952,PMC2843952_2
More small droplets were produced during the more violent activity of coughing.,PMC2843952,PMC2843952_3
"The study provides more information about respiratory droplets produced by healthy subjects, supporting the belief that talking and coughing play important roles in the generation of respiratory droplets.",PMC2843952,PMC2843952_4
