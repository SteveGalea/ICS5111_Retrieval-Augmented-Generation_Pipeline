"The study found that the basic reproduction number (R0) for the novel influenza A/H1N1 virus in Germany is estimated to be 1.58, with a range of 1.34 to 2.04. This is based on assumptions made about the age distribution and size of the population in Germany, as well as the severity and infectiousness of the virus.",PMC2791869,PMC2791869_0
"The study also found that children (under the age of 15) are less susceptible to infection with the novel influenza A/H1N1 virus than adults. Specifically, the study estimated that children have a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.06, with a range of 1.60 to 3.31, compared to adults, who have an R0 of 1.58.",PMC2791869,PMC2791869_1
"The study suggests that intensive measures, such as isolation and therapy of cases, are necessary to control the spread of the novel influenza A/H1N1 virus. These measures were assumed to be maintained for the first 100 cases, followed by less intensive measures focusing on the household.",PMC2791869,PMC2791869_2
"The study found that a high number of imported cases could lead to a significant delay in the peak of the epidemic. This is illustrated in Figure S4, which shows the delay in days depending on the number of imported cases, as well as the case detection rate.",PMC2791869,PMC2791869_3
"The study also suggests that contact tracing and post-exposure prophylaxis are effective in controlling the spread of the novel influenza A/H1N1 virus, as these measures were assumed to be implemented for the first 500 detected cases, followed by less intensive measures focusing on the household. The effectiveness of these measures is reflected in the delay of the epidemic curve, as shown in Figure S3.",PMC2791869,PMC2791869_4
