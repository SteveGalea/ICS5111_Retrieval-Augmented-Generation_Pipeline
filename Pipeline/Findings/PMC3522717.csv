"Among the 502 hospitalized children with influenza a(H1N1)pdm09 in Stockholm during the 2009 pandemic, 61.6% had a respiratory virus detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 16.5% were infected with H1N1. Co-infections with two or more viruses were detected in 14.6% of the positive samples, and 14.5% of the H1N1 infected children were positive for an additional virus. Some viruses were more often detected in combination with another virus, such as HBV and HCOV, while HRV, H1N1, PIV2, and RSV were mostly detected as single respiratory viral infections.",PMC3522717,PMC3522717_0
"Among the positive samples, only 26.9% were positive for H1N1, suggesting that several other respiratory viruses caused illness. Co-infections with two or more viruses might rather represent accumulation of persistent viral shedding during the autumn.",PMC3522717,PMC3522717_1
"The children infected with H1N1 were older than children infected with HCOV, HEV, HRV, and RSV. HRV is commonly detected in asymptomatic individuals, and viral shedding is known to occur for several weeks after an infection. Co-infections were mainly detected in children 1-6 years of age, as this age group attends daycare in Sweden and is known to be at high risk of respiratory viral infections.",PMC3522717,PMC3522717_2
"The increasing frequency of co-infections during the study period might also reflect seasonality of HRV disease, but could also be an effect of increased sampling due to the fear of H1N1pdm09 during the pandemic.",PMC3522717,PMC3522717_3
"The viruses detected in these hospitalized children are likely to only partly reflect the spread of different viruses in the studied population, as hospital data cannot be used to address whether viral interference prevented the spread of H1N1 in Stockholm. To further investigate interactions of respiratory viruses, population-based prospective studies with longitudinal sampling would be highly informative.",PMC3522717,PMC3522717_4
