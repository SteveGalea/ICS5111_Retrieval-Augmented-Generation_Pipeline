"The study found that igf1 expression was upregulated following influenza virus infection, and igf1 receptor phosphorylation was elevated, triggering two signaling pathways downstream of pi3k/akt and mapk to induce inflammation.",PMC6887893,PMC6887893_0
"The administration of igf1 protein following influenza virus infection aggravated influenza-mediated inflammatory responses, while the inhibition of igf1 or igf1r expression to block downstream signaling pathways alleviated such responses.",PMC6887893,PMC6887893_1
"The study found that the viral proliferation in the lungs of mice treated with igf1 was significantly increased, while the viral proliferation of the mice treated with the igf1r inhibitor was similar to that of the untreated group.",PMC6887893,PMC6887893_2
"The study found that the phosphorylation of igf1r triggered the pi3k/akt and mapk signaling pathways to induce inflammation, and the expression of key proteins associated with p38 in the mapk and the pi3k/akt signaling pathways in the context of influenza virus-mediated inflammation.",PMC6887893,PMC6887893_3
"The study found that during the same period of viral infection, when the igf1r inhibitor was used to inhibit igf1r, the clinical symptoms of mice were alleviated, the lung injury area was reduced, the degree of lung injury was reduced, the lung index was significantly decreased, and the survival rate increased from 25 to 75% compared with the untreated group.",PMC6887893,PMC6887893_4
