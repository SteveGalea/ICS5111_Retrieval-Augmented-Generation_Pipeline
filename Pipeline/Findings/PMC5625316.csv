"A conceptual framework for understanding a reservoir of infection has been established through various studies that have emphasized different aspects of zoonotic diseases. This framework focuses on the annotation of a target group, which is an explicitly defined population of interest in a dynamic and heterogeneous landscape, and all other susceptible populations that directly or indirectly connect epidemiologically to the target group. For a non-target population to be considered an accepted functional reservoir, maintenance of a single pathogen in the population needs to be shown in combination with a feasible transmission route between the target and non-target populations.",PMC5625316,PMC5625316_0
"According to Haydon et al., a functional orientation of the presented framework allows for straightforward application but does not negate more complex populations. The same principles can be applied to multi-species systems and metapopulations. The defined target group may be adjusted based on interest and may therefore include metapopulations.",PMC5625316,PMC5625316_1
"The simplicity and functional orientation of the presented framework allows for straightforward application but does not negate more complex populations. The same principles can be applied to multi-species systems and metapopulations. According to the accepted definition of a reservoir proposed by Haydon et al., two parts are discussed in order to demonstrate the requirements in two parts: the pathogenâ€™s maintenance in a potential population followed by a discussion on proof of a feasible transmission route.",PMC5625316,PMC5625316_2
"Owing to the functional orientation of the requirements and for simplicity, all entities involved in the biological lifecycles of a parasite (for example, primary and intermediate hosts) should be considered a single functional unit. Appropriate sequence and functional analysis of a pathogen isolated multiple times from a potential reservoir should be required to prove that a pathogen is maintained in a population.",PMC5625316,PMC5625316_3
"The ability to quickly and cheaply sequence whole genomes has allowed for better genetic resolution. However, mutation rates vary significantly between pathogens, and the threshold for sequence and functional similarity must be individually defined and accepted by the scientific community. For example, the bacterium Treponema pallidum (which causes syphilis in rabbits), is over 99% identical on the basis of the whole genome to the human pathogen T. Pallidum (which causes human treponematosis), but does not provide sufficient evidence for the involvement of a pathogen and its ability to infect both groups. Therefore, proof that a pathogen can",PMC5625316,PMC5625316_4
