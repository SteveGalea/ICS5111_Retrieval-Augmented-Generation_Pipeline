This study confirms and extends previous findings that γδ T cells mediate demyelination in mice infected with JHM.,PMC1181615,PMC1181615_0
"Most importantly, nkg2d+ cells are critical for virus-induced demyelination and are consistent with previous results indicating a role for this receptor molecule in autoimmune diabetes.",PMC1181615,PMC1181615_1
"Treatment with the anti-nkg2d monoclonal antibody results in diminished infiltration of macrophages and microglia into the white matter, suggesting that these cells play a central role in effecting demyelination.",PMC1181615,PMC1181615_2
"This study provides additional evidence that IFN-γ is critical for demyelination to occur and also is consistent with the notion that γδ T-cell activation in the JHM-infected mouse occurs via a mechanism, ligation of the NKG2D receptor, which does not involve recognition of a viral antigen.",PMC1181615,PMC1181615_3
These results may be relevant for understanding the role of γδ T cells in multiple sclerosis and raise the possibility that γδ T cells have both regulatory and effector roles in the CNS of affected humans.,PMC1181615,PMC1181615_4
