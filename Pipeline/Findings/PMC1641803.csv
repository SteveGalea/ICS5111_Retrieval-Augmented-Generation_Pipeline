"A vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) system was developed to produce infectious vesicles loaded with minigenomes of the bunyavirus Uukuniemi (UUKV), allowing for the study of UUKV under lower biosafety conditions.",PMC1641803,PMC1641803_0
"Vesicles containing UUKV minigenomes were released into the supernatant of transfected cells, displaying similar morphological surface structure and size as UUKV.",PMC1641803,PMC1641803_1
"The UUKV-derived vesicles were also found to bud from the golgi apparatus in a similar manner to UUKV, with both glycoproteins required for assembly and release of UUKV also sufficient for vesicle budding.",PMC1641803,PMC1641803_2
"Vesicles could be produced with only the glycoproteins of UUKV, suggesting that the nucleoprotein does not have the ""matrix"" functions of other viruses and instead, the cytoplasmic tails of both glycoproteins might initiate budding and determine the size and shape of UUKV particles.",PMC1641803,PMC1641803_3
"The vesicles generated with only the glycoproteins alone were shown to contain rNAs, allowing for the study of UUKV packaging and budding under lower biosafety conditions.",PMC1641803,PMC1641803_4
