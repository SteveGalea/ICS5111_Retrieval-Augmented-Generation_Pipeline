"In a cohort of 109 children with acute wheeze, no significant differences in bacterial community composition were found between cases and healthy controls. However, children with bronchiolitis had significantly lower bacterial diversity compared to other groups of subjects.",PMC6797130,PMC6797130_0
"The wide age range within the study population helped explain some of the variation observed in the bacterial community, as age had a significant influence on both the bacterial community and blood cell counts in this study.",PMC6797130,PMC6797130_1
"The bacterial community in the paediatric population is diverse and heterogeneous, making it difficult to test for significant associations between clinical variables and the oropharyngeal bacterial community.",PMC6797130,PMC6797130_2
"Prospective longitudinal investigation of children pre, during, and post viral infection may help identify if the bacterial community is either protective or a risk factor for viral infection and respiratory wheeze.",PMC6797130,PMC6797130_3
"In a small subset of patients with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, significant differences in alpha and beta diversity measures were observed, but this may have been driven by subjects with bronchiolitis being significantly younger than other groups of subjects.",PMC6797130,PMC6797130_4
