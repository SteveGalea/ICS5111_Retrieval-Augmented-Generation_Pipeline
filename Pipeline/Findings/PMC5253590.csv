"The study found that patients older than 51 years represented a larger than expected fraction of outbreak cases compared to non-outbreak cases, suggesting that older individuals are at increased risk of dying from MERS-CoV infection.",PMC5253590,PMC5253590_0
"Nosocomial infections occurred more frequently among outbreak cases compared to non-outbreak cases, indicating that nosocomial outbreaks are fueled by nosocomial infections.",PMC5253590,PMC5253590_1
"Healthcare workers comprised 22% of all Saudi Arabian MERS-CoV cases diagnosed up to October 2015, consistent with previous studies reporting predominantly male patients with MERS-CoV infection.",PMC5253590,PMC5253590_2
"The study found that 17% of non-outbreak cases and 10% of outbreak cases reporting data on camel exposure indicated that patients owned or raised camels, suggesting that camel exposure, and thus zoonotic transmission, may be more common among sporadic, non-outbreak cases than among outbreak cases.",PMC5253590,PMC5253590_3
"Improved future surveillance may allow for faster identification of sporadic MERS-CoV cases, as outbreak cases have been confirmed faster than non-outbreak cases, indicating that faster implementation of infection control measures in healthcare settings may be critical to preventing future outbreaks.",PMC5253590,PMC5253590_4
