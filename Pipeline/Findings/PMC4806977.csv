"Among healthcare-associated transmission events in our investigation, nearly all (>90%) occurred before mers-cov diagnosis, highlighting the importance of early detection and adherence to infection prevention policies.",PMC4806977,PMC4806977_0
"In the largest healthcare cluster, despite strong hospital and public health policies for triaging and isolating patients with respiratory symptoms as part of the mers-cov response, the source case-patient was placed under standard precautions, rather than contact and airborne precautions.",PMC4806977,PMC4806977_1
"The severity of illness associated with mers-cov infection among case-patients in our investigation ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease, as has been previously reported.",PMC4806977,PMC4806977_2
"In addition, transmission pathways were generated on the basis of self-reporting or other documentation, and exposures may have been missed or forgotten.",PMC4806977,PMC4806977_3
"Because our objective was to characterize transmission patterns among known healthcare-associated cases, we considered the conservative definition of healthcare-associated cases to be most appropriate, restricting our definition to persons with recognized exposures in healthcare settings, and we may underestimate the true number of cases, particularly if sources of infection (i.e., case-patients) went undetected.",PMC4806977,PMC4806977_4
