"This study demonstrated a direct virus-induced inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway in cultured cells by hantaviruses, specifically tularemia virus (TULV), topaare hantavirus (TOPV), Seoul hantavirus (SEOV), and Puumaala hantavirus (PUUV).",PMC2569924,PMC2569924_0
"ERK1/2 activity is required for cell survival and is activated by phosphorylation to threonine and tyrosine residues. This study found that ERK1/2 activity is reduced, which may render cells sensitive to apoptosis, in infected cells.",PMC2569924,PMC2569924_1
"In addition, this study showed that ERK1/2 activity is required for the efficient replication of some hantaviruses, including TULV, as virus-induced inhibition of ERK1/2 activity synergistically enhances tnf-α-mediated apoptotic cell death.",PMC2569924,PMC2569924_2
"Furthermore, the study found that ERK1/2 activity is required for the efficient replication of hantaviruses, as ERK1/2 inhibition was observed in cells infected with hantaviruses, including TULV, topaare hantavirus (TOPV), Seoul hantavirus (SEOV), and Puumaala hantavirus (PUUV), and in cells infected with hantavirus and treated with tnf-α.",PMC2569924,PMC2569924_3
"This study also suggested that ERK1/2 inhibition could be a general feature of hantavirus-mediated apoptotic cell death, as ERK1/2 inhibition was observed in cells infected with hantavirus and treated with tnf-α.",PMC2569924,PMC2569924_4
