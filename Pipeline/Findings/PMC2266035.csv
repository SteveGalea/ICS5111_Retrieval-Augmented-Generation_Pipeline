The study found that the predominance of CD3+ T cells on SIG B cells in both nasal and SI LP mucosae in pigs is consistent with findings in humans but conflicts with findings in mice.,PMC2266035,PMC2266035_0
"The study also found that in pigs, most nasal and SI LP SIGA+ B cells express INTEGRIN α4, which may contribute to their retention in contact with VCAM-1 expressed by interstitial cells.",PMC2266035,PMC2266035_1
"The study found that the expression of CCL28, a chemokine involved in nasal homing of SIGA+ ALPHA4BETA7/ALPHA4 cells, is higher in the nasal mucosa than in the SI mucosa.",PMC2266035,PMC2266035_2
"The study found that the expression of EPITHELIAL CELL-EXPRESSED CHEMOKINES, CCL25 in the SI mucosa and CXCL12 in both nasal and SI LP, is weaker than that in the nasal mucosa.",PMC2266035,PMC2266035_3
"The study found that in pigs, most SIGA+ ALPHA4BETA7/ALPHA4 cells in the SI LP express INTEGRIN α4, but their homing is still not fully understood.",PMC2266035,PMC2266035_4
