"In a study published in the Journal of Immunology, researchers developed a new vaccine candidate against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using a recombinant RSV fusion protein (RSV-F) and a recombinant RSV fusion protein (RSV-G) expressing the RSV G protein and the RSV F protein, respectively. The vaccination candidate was administered to mice intramuscularly, and RSV-specific neutralizing antibody titers were determined in their sera. The results showed that the RSV-G-RSV-F vaccine candidate induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies, providing a promising approach for RSV vaccine development.",PMC2753736,PMC2753736_0
