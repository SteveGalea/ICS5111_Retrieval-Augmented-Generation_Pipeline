"A study on the prevalence of porcine kobuvirus (PKV) in fecal samples collected from different regions of Gansu province, China, revealed that PKV infection is more prevalent in piglets than in adult pigs, and coinfections or mixed infections with other viruses, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and sapovirus (SAV), are common.",PMC4884858,PMC4884858_0
"The study found that PKV infection is often associated with porcine diarrheal diseases, highlighting the need for a national PKV surveillance program in China.",PMC4884858,PMC4884858_1
"The study showed that PKV infection is frequently observed in mixed infections or coinfections with other viruses, suggesting that further studies should be conducted to estimate the prevalence of PKV infections in other provinces of China and to improve our understanding of this virus and allow for its control.",PMC4884858,PMC4884858_2
"The study found that PKV infection is more prevalent in piglets with diarrhea than in adult pigs with diarrhea, indicating that PKV may be an opportunistic pathogen of gastroenteritis in pigs.",PMC4884858,PMC4884858_3
"The study revealed that the PKV infection rate in Gansu province is higher than that in pigs with diarrhea in China, suggesting that further research is needed to estimate the prevalence of PKV infections in other provinces of China and to determine the full spectrum of Kobuvirus hosts to establish the possibility of cross-species infections among animals and humans and the genomic similarities and homologies between different regions and different hosts.",PMC4884858,PMC4884858_4
