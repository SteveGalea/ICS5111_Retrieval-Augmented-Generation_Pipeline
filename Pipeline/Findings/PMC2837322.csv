"The study found that respiratory viruses, particularly rhinoviruses (HRVs), are the most common viruses detected in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients during the first 100 days after transplantation, with a high incidence of 22% and prolonged periods of symptomatic viral shedding in 13% of persons with HRV and 41% of persons with HRV and HCOV infection, respectively.",PMC2837322,PMC2837322_0
The study also found that HRV infection was associated with mild respiratory symptoms and was the probable factor contributing to lower respiratory disease and death in 4% of patients infected with this virus.,PMC2837322,PMC2837322_1
"The study noted that HRV, but not HCOV, was associated with the presence of mild respiratory symptoms, and HRV infection may trigger an immune response leading to airway decline.",PMC2837322,PMC2837322_2
"The study found that HRV, but not HCOV, infection was associated with the presence of mild respiratory symptoms, and HRV, in particular, may trigger an immune response leading to airway decline.",PMC2837322,PMC2837322_3
"The study found that HRV and HCOV infections occurred in one-third of HCT recipients during the first 100 days after transplantation, with a high incidence of infection, but the rate of pneumonia and death attributable to these viruses was low compared with other common respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), influenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus (HMPVs).",PMC2837322,PMC2837322_4
