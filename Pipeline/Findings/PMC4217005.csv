"The discovery of a novel type III interferon, IFNL4, which is poorly secreted and weakly expressed, may explain the strong genetic associations observed between gwas markers within the IFNL gene cluster and hepatitis C (HCV) clearance, while simultaneously raising questions concerning its functional mechanism and full clinical implications. IFNL4 signals through the IFNLR1/IL-10R2 receptor complex despite relatively low sequence similarity with IFNL3 in the region which binds to the IL-10R2 chain. IFNL4, unlike most IFNs, is a poorly secreted protein. IFNL4 impairs HCV clearance by impeding receptor binding of the other members of the IFN-L family either due to differences in structure or secretion. The IFNL4-ΔG allele, which underwent very strong negative genetic selection with replacement of the ancestral IFNL4-T allele in non-African populations, is associated with lower expression of IFNL4 mRNA, which may result in lower HCV clearance rates in individuals who carry IFNL4-ΔG. However, daa regimens, which target various aspects of the HCV life cycle, promise to markedly increase HCV clearance rates and eliminate the adverse effects associated with IFN-α treatment. IFNL4-ΔG genotype associations may be relevant for IFN-based treatment for other clinical conditions, similar to the associations that have been observed for the treatment of chronic HCV and chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The strong selection pressure against the IFNL4-ΔG allele in human populations could have resulted from an infectious agent that is now extinct, or IFNL4 plays an important role in contemporary infectious diseases other than HCV and CHB. IFNL4-ΔG genotype associations may be detected through studies based on the IFNL4-ΔG genotype or through gwas.",PMC4217005,PMC4217005_0
