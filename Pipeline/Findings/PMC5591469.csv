"Among the healthy puppies screened, 80% were found positive for C. Difficile, and 10% were positive for C. Pervidens.",PMC5591469,PMC5591469_0
"Among the affected puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea, all were positive for C. Difficile, 90.3% were positive for C. Pervidens, 17.7% were positive for CPE, 16.7% were positive for CPA toxin, 15.6% were positive for E. Coli STEC, 15.6% were positive for E. Coli LT, and 10.8% were positive for C. Pervidens STEC.",PMC5591469,PMC5591469_1
"Among the puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea, C. Difficile was identified as a common enteropathogen, and its role in pathogenesis is not clearly understood.",PMC5591469,PMC5591469_2
"C. Pervidens and C. Difficile toxin B, Enteric Ccov, and Rotavirus were found negative in all 62 puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea screened.",PMC5591469,PMC5591469_3
"Among the diarrheic puppies, a higher prevalence of C. Difficile was evident in the locality, and effective vaccination programs, client education, and disinfection strategies will help in reducing the incidence. Cefotaxime was found useful against few gram-positive and most of the gram-negative microbes implicated in parvoviral enteritis, and Gentamicin was found to have the maximum sensitivity pattern against the enteropathogens implicated in severe hemorrhagic diarrhea.",PMC5591469,PMC5591469_4
