"The authors identified a multitude of mirnas, including mir-9, that were upregulated with oc43 n expression and tnf-α treatment. This finding suggests that oc43 n interacts with cellular rnas beyond just the viral genome.",PMC3911702,PMC3911702_0
The authors found that the oc43 n protein binds mir-9 and prevents its functionality via this interaction. This finding indicates that oc43 n is interfering with mir-9's negative regulation of nfkb1 translation.,PMC3911702,PMC3911702_1
"The authors observed an increase in both nfkb1 and mir-9 transcription upon stimulation in oc43-infected cells, but oc43 n continues to bind mir-9, preventing inhibition of nfkb1 translation. This finding suggests that oc43 potentiates nfkb1 activation.",PMC3911702,PMC3911702_2
"The authors propose a model in which oc43 n prevents negative regulation of nfkb1 expression by binding mir-9, which is basally expressed, and preventing its control of nfkb1 mRNA. This finding provides insight into the mechanism by which oc43 n is interacting with the nf-κb pathway.",PMC3911702,PMC3911702_3
"The authors recognize that n is binding other cellular rNAs besides mir-9, indicating that its interaction with cellular rNAs is not limited to mir-9. This finding suggests that the contact between n and cellular rNAs may be inadvertent.",PMC3911702,PMC3911702_4
