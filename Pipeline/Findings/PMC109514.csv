The tmd of e2 plays a major role in its retention in the ER.,PMC109514,PMC109514_0
Replacement of the tmd of e2 by the anchor and cytoplasmic domains of CD4 leads to e2 expression on the cell surface.,PMC109514,PMC109514_1
The chimeric forms of e2 produced in this work do not interact with e1.,PMC109514,PMC109514_2
The absence of an additional retention signal in the ectodomain of e2 is confirmed by the expression and cell surface localization of chimeric proteins containing the ectodomain of e2 ending at amino acid 661 or 717.,PMC109514,PMC109514_3
The addition of a Gpi moiety to the ectodomain of e2 leads to expression of e2 on the cell surface.,PMC109514,PMC109514_4
"The addition of a Gpi moiety to the ectodomain of e2 leads to expression of e2 on the cell surface, indicating that a Gpi molecule confers membrane anchoring. However, the coexpression of e1 with the chimeric forms of e2 produced in this work did not result in the formation of e1-e2 complexes, suggesting that the tmd of e2 is involved in hCV glycoprotein interactions.",PMC109514,PMC109514_5
