The study demonstrated that porcine apn (papn) protein expression is required for pdcov and tgev infection in vitro.,PMC5974500,PMC5974500_0
"The researchers generated two stable cell lines, vero-papn and bhk-papn, in which they expressed the papn-myc fusion protein, and confirmed the expression by immunofluorescence assay.",PMC5974500,PMC5974500_1
"The study found that soluble human igg1 fusion proteins (tgev-s1-hfc, pdcov-s1-hfc, and hfc) were able to bind to soluble papn-mfc or mfc, and this binding could be blocked by preincubation with soluble papn-mfc or mfc for 2 hours prior to performance of a surface binding assay.",PMC5974500,PMC5974500_2
"The researchers used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) to monitor pdcov RNA copy numbers, and standard curves were performed to allow absolute quantitation of pdcov RNA copy numbers based upon the levels of in vitro-transcribed RNA containing the targeting sequences.",PMC5974500,PMC5974500_3
"The study generated two new stable cell lines expressing the papn-myc fusion protein, vero-papn and bhk-papn, in which they confirmed expression by immunofluorescence assay with an anti-myc mAb (Cell Signaling Technology) and an anti-apn pAb.",PMC5974500,PMC5974500_4
