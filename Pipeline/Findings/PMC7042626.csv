"The activation of angiotensin II (ang II)/AT1R axis in the brain leads to an increase in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation, causing neurodegeneration in several brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (3.2, 3.3, 3.5).",PMC7042626,PMC7042626_0
"The use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as candesartan and telmisartan, has been reported to significantly reduce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the retina and retinal explants, as well as in cerebrovascular pathologies (3.5).",PMC7042626,PMC7042626_1
"The expression and interaction of enzymes and peptides related to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including renin, angiotensin I (Ang I), angiotensin II (Ang II), angiotensin (1-7) (ACE), and angiotensin receptor subtypes AT1R and AT2R, have been demonstrated in the brain (3.1-3.2, 3.4-3.5).",PMC7042626,PMC7042626_2
"The local expression and physiological/pathological roles of RAS, especially in specific cell types within the brain, are still poorly characterized due to the limited availability and characterization of commercially available antibodies (3.6).",PMC7042626,PMC7042626_3
"The improved understanding of RAS in the brain would open new approaches, novel methods, and promising targets for protecting several neurodegenerative diseases of the brain (3.5-3.6).",PMC7042626,PMC7042626_4
