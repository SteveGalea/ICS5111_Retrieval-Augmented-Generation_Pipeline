"The study documents the first reported outbreak of canine distemper virus (CDV) in endangered giant pandas in China, resulting in the deaths of six out of six affected pandas.",PMC4910525,PMC4910525_0
"The study reveals that the surviving giant panda, previously vaccinated against CDV, did not develop clinical signs despite CDV recovery from blood and nasal swab samples, suggesting that vaccination may have attenuated disease.",PMC4910525,PMC4910525_1
"The study identifies unique amino acid substitutions in the CDV h protein encoded by the giant panda/sx/2014 isolate, which have not been observed previously in asia-1 strains, potentially facilitating CDV infection of giant pandas.",PMC4910525,PMC4910525_2
"The study highlights the need for universal CDV vaccination of captive giant pandas for successful conservation of this endangered species, as the outbreak demonstrates the importance of heightened surveillance and vaccination.",PMC4910525,PMC4910525_3
The study also suggests that histopathological analysis and virus isolation from tissue samples collected from CDV-infected giant pandas may be useful in the investigation of CDV infection in captive animals.,PMC4910525,PMC4910525_4
