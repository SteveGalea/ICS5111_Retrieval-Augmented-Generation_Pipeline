"The study found that metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mngs) is a highly sensitive and specific method for semi-quantitative detection of respiratory pathogenic viruses, with a good negative predictive value, indicating its potential for excluding known viral infectious causes in one test.",PMC6812800,PMC6812800_0
"The study detected a high abundance of bacteriophages in the respiratory microbiome, which may indicate virome dysbiosis during chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) exacerbations.",PMC6812800,PMC6812800_1
"The study found that the respiratory virome in patients with copd exacerbations is dominated by rhinoviruses, followed by influenza viruses and coronaviruses, with a high sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for mngs.",PMC6812800,PMC6812800_2
"The study suggests that virome dysbiosis may be accompanied by bacterial overgrowth and infections during copd exacerbations, as well as hypothetically the role of bacteriophages in the horizontal gene transfer of bacterial virulence factors.",PMC6812800,PMC6812800_3
"The study highlights the potential for mngs to exclude any infectious cause, both viral and bacterial, in one test, with significant consequences for starting and/or continuation of antimicrobial or immune-modulating treatment, as well as for clinical decision making.",PMC6812800,PMC6812800_4
