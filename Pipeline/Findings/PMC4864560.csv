The authors report two cases of neurological complications in patients infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).,PMC4864560,PMC4864560_0
"The first patient, a 34-year-old female with diabetes, presented with symptoms of encephalitis, including ataxia, vomiting, confusion, and fever. She had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are considered comorbidities in this case. The diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalomyelitisitis (ADEM). Treatments included broad-spectrum antibiotics, oseltamivir, bronchodilators, methylprednisolone, intravenous sedation, neuromuscular blockers, inhaled nitric oxide, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, peginterferon alpha-2b, and ribavirin. The outcome was death due to deep coma, poor overall condition, and worsening cardiovascular and respiratory status.",PMC4864560,PMC4864560_1
"The second patient, a 28-year-old male with diabetes, presented with flu-like illness, fever, and a gangrenous toe. He had a history of diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease bilateral anterior cerebral artery stroke. The diagnosis was critical illness polyneuropathy complicating a long intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Treatments included broad-spectrum antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin, pulse steroid therapy, respiratory support, and physiotherapy. The outcome was recovery with improvement in respiratory functions, extubation, and transfer to the floor.",PMC4864560,PMC4864560_2
"The authors propose a different theory for explaining the mechanism by which MERS-CoV reaches the nervous system, which is predominantly through the autoimmune theory with several involvements of the neural tissues and blood vessels through autoreactive T-cells recognizing both viral and myelin antigens as similar molecules, resulting in neurological complications in genetically susceptible individuals.",PMC4864560,PMC4864560_3
The authors suggest that using steroids in MERS-CoV infected cases that present with or develop neurological complications will be beneficial in reducing the mort,PMC4864560,PMC4864560_4
