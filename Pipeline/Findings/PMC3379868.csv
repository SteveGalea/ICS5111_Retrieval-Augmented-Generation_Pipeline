"In a 2-year study of 132 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD), an infectious cause was identified in 36.3% of cases. Bacterial infections were found in 24.1% of patients, viral infections in 9%, and mixed bacterial and viral infections in 1.5%.",PMC3379868,PMC3379868_0
"The study found that clinical and laboratory variables used to differentiate the cause of AE-COPD were similar for bacterial and viral etiologies, except for a relative lymphocyte count, which was lower in the group with viral etiology, and a longer hospitalization period in patients with bacterial infections.",PMC3379868,PMC3379868_1
"The study also found that patients with bacterial infections had a greater involvement of baseline arterial blood gas, with a decrease in pH and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), and increased leukocytes and heart rate, possibly indicating a bronchospasm component in addition to bacterial infection.",PMC3379868,PMC3379868_2
"The study found that viral diseases have a seasonal distribution and efforts to confirm the diagnosis in routine clinical practice are to be reserved for situations in which viruses are present in the community; otherwise, this diagnosis could lead to a significant economic cost.",PMC3379868,PMC3379868_3
The study suggests that differentiating the etiology of AE-COPD on the basis of clinical and laboratory data is difficult in common clinical practice and that the most profitable diagnostic tests to identify the possible cause of the acute decompensation of a patient with COPD are the conventional sputum test for bacteria and molecular biology techniques for viruses.,PMC3379868,PMC3379868_4
