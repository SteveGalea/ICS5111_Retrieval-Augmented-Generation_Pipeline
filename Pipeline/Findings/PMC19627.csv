"The authors successfully constructed a full-length arterivirus cDNA clone, peav030, and demonstrated its infectivity using several biological and biochemical assays. The stability of the 15.6-kb construct, based on pUC18, was not affected by the insertion of the cat gene at two different positions.",PMC19627,PMC19627_0
"The authors generated and passedaged eav030h virus containing a genetic marker mutation to facilitate the future development and exploitation of peav030 as an expression vector. High cat levels were detected in cells transfected with eavcat2 and eavcat7 rNA, indicating promising results for the development of a peav030-based expression system.",PMC19627,PMC19627_1
"The authors detected an interesting defect in the eav030f construct, which appeared to be a complete block of structural protein expression. The absence of cytopathic effect (cpe) or plaques after a 4-day incubation suggests a complete inhibition of structural protein expression.",PMC19627,PMC19627_2
"The authors identified a complete inhibition of subgenomic mRNA transcription in the eav030f construct, suggesting a complete block of structural protein expression. A trace of rna7 RT-PCR product was detected in the eav030f sample, but it was considered to be an artefact of the RT or PCR procedure.",PMC19627,PMC19627_3
"The authors detected the apparently complete inhibition of subgenomic mRNA transcription in the eav030f construct, which may be explained as an artefact of the RT or PCR procedure, or may be due to the resulting replicase point mutation. Residue ser-2429 is conserved in the three available arterivirus replicase sequences, and it is located between two well-conserved domains in the nidovirus replicase. The authors are currently investigating the properties of the ser-2429 â†’ pro mutant.",PMC19627,PMC19627_4
