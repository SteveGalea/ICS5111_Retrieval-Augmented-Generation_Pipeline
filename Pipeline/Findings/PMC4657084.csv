"The chikungunya virus non-structural protein (NSP2) protease, which plays a crucial role in viral replication, is not a papain-like cysteine protease, but instead uses either a cysteine or a proximal serine residue in the active site. This finding challenges the previously held notion that papain-like cysteine proteases are widespread in viruses.",PMC4657084,PMC4657084_0
The interchangeability of the catalytic dyad cysteine and serine residues in the active site suggests a more complex mechanism for the NSP2 protease than previously thought. This finding suggests that the enzyme's active site conformation is not fixed but instead presents varying structures due to small molecules such as metal ions and protease inhibitors.,PMC4657084,PMC4657084_1
"The chikungunya NSP2 protease retains activity in the presence of either a cysteine or a proximal serine residue, indicating that the catalytic mechanism is more complex than previously thought. This finding also suggests that the enzyme's active site conformation is not fixed but rather presents varying structures due to small molecules such as metal ions and protease inhibitors.",PMC4657084,PMC4657084_2
The interchangeability of the catalytic dyad cysteine and serine residues in the active site suggests that the chikungunya NSP2 protease may employ either a cysteine or a proximal serine residue for catalysis interchangeably. This finding challenges the previously held notion that viral proteases employ a specific catalytic residue.,PMC4657084,PMC4657084_3
"The thermal stability test revealed that the chikungunya NSP2 protease retains activity after incubation at 42 Â°C for 10 minutes, suggesting that the enzyme's active site conformation is not fixed but rather presents varying structures due to small molecules such as metal ions and protease inhibitors. This finding also suggests that the enzyme's active site conformation is not irreversibly denatured by elevated temperatures.",PMC4657084,PMC4657084_4
