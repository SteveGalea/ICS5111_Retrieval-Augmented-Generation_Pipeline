"This study reports for the first time an association between oas1 polymorphisms and prostate cancer. The functional oas1 polymorphic markers rs2660 and rs1131454 are associated with a disease/viral infection. In general, the rs2660 aa genotype promotes disease susceptibility, whereas the gg genotype confers protection.",PMC3167978,PMC3167978_0
"The aa genotype, which is associated with prostate cancer, appears to be a risk factor with age in prostate cancer, as expected. The absence of an rs2660 homozygous gg genotype in individuals of African ethnicity is essentially consistent with population-wide genotype distribution reported in the NIH dbSNP database.",PMC3167978,PMC3167978_1
"The frequency of the g allele in the ss38908277 African American set is only 0.09%, compared with a frequency of 9.7% (exclusively from the ag genotype) in the normal African American sample set. This suggests that oas1 polymorphisms and perhaps spliced variants may be determined genetically in African Americans.",PMC3167978,PMC3167978_2
"In addition to rs2660, rs10774671 and rs3177979 (all on exon 7) also are nonsynonymous and in linkage disequilibrium. It will be interesting to investigate whether the proposed linkage disequilibrium exists between this block in prostate cancer cells and in the sample set.",PMC3167978,PMC3167978_3
"Polymorphisms in oas1 like rs2660 not only can modulate the effects of higher risk susceptibility genes responsible for hereditary prostate cancer but also may promote sporadic prostate cancer independently, possibly because of congenital rubella virus infection.",PMC3167978,PMC3167978_4
