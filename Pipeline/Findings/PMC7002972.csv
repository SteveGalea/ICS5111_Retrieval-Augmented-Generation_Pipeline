"The study demonstrated that icariin, a natural compound extracted from horny goat weed, promoted osteogenic differentiation in bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) through the upregulation of the circadian clock gene bmal1 and its downstream target bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) signaling pathway.",PMC7002972,PMC7002972_0
"The study found that icariin at a concentration range between 10^-9^ and 10^-5^ mol/l significantly promoted the proliferation of BMSCs, especially at 10^-7^ mol/l.",PMC7002972,PMC7002972_1
"The study revealed that reduced expression of BMP2/runx2 was observed during osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs with bmal1 deficiency, and mineralized nodule formation was suppressed both in BMSCs with bmal1 deficiency and in icariin-mediated BMSCs with bmal1 deficiency.",PMC7002972,PMC7002972_2
"The study suggested that bmal1 deficiency decreased BMP2 expression during osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and the disorder and downregulation of clock genes may be the cause of disease, and in some cases could also be used as a target of drug action to improve disease symptoms and treat disease.",PMC7002972,PMC7002972_3
"The study highlighted the potential of icariin as a novel preventive and therapeutic agent for circadian clock-related diseases, as it demonstrated the bone-strengthening activity of icariin and its potential mechanism via which osteogenic differentiation is mediated between icariin and bmal1.",PMC7002972,PMC7002972_4
