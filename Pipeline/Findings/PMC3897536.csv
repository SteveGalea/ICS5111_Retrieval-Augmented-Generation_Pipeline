"In a study on the effect of immunosuppressive treatment on hbv replication, it was found that the discontinuation of immunosuppressive treatment did not always result in the restoration of hbv clearance in hbv-persistent mice. Instead, hbv replication was suppressed in mice treated with the selected immunosuppressant drugs, and the intrahepatic expression of hbv-specific cd8 t cells was restored, leading to hbv clearance.",PMC3897536,PMC3897536_0
"In a study on the frequency of hbv-specific cd8 t cells, it was found that the frequency of hbv-specific cd8 t cells was increased after hbv transfection and that the restoration of the t cell response led to hbv clearance in hbv-persistent mice.",PMC3897536,PMC3897536_1
"In a study on the effect of immunosuppressive treatment on skin graft survival, it was found that the survival times of skin grafts in mice treated with immunosuppressive drugs were comparable to those in mice treated with saline.",PMC3897536,PMC3897536_2
"In a study on the effect of immunosuppressive treatment on hbv-specific cd8 t cells, it was found that the frequency of hbv-specific cd8 t cells was generally low in balb/c mice with acute hbv1.2 and that the restoration of the t cell response led to hbv clearance in these mice.",PMC3897536,PMC3897536_3
"In a study on the effect of immunosuppressive treatment on skin graft survival, it was found that the survival times of skin grafts in mice treated with immunosuppressive drugs were comparable to those in mice treated with saline, but that the grafts in mice treated with saline had a higher incidence of rejection.",PMC3897536,PMC3897536_4
