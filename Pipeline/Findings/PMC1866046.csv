"The nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV, encoded at the 5' terminus of the viral genome, forms a previously unknown, complex β-barrel fold with several unique structural features. This fold is characterized by an irregular β-barrel geometry, distorted β-sheets, and a unique arrangement of the linker polypeptide segments between adjacent β-sheets.",PMC1866046,PMC1866046_0
"The nsp1 protein contains a positively charged surface patch, which may mediate specific as well as nonspecific intermolecular interactions by electrostatic forces. This patch is formed by lysine residues 48, 125, and 126, which are conserved in the MHV NSP1 protein but not in the p9 NSP1 proteins of group 1 coronaviruses.",PMC1866046,PMC1866046_1
"The nsp1 protein promotes mRNA degradation, but the MHV NSP1 protein, which is homologous to NSP1 of SARS-CoV, also causes cell cycle arrest in cultured cells. The most striking result of the alignment of SARS-CoV NSP1 with the polypeptide fragment consisting of residues 46 to 247 of MHV NSP1 is the observation of a consensus sequence, LRKXGXKG, positioned at the end of strand β6 of the globular domain of SARS-CoV NSP1, which is conserved not only in MHV NSP1 but also in human COV OC43 NSP1.",PMC1866046,PMC1866046_2
"The nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV lacks residues corresponding to arginine 110 and leucine 111 of MHV NSP1, which were identified as a potential cyclin-binding motif by Chen et al. (2010). In addition, residues 30 to 33 (Ser/Asn) of MHV NSP1, which occur in an N-terminal 45-residue segment, were identified as a potential site for phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Chen et al., 2010). These residues occur in an N-termin",PMC1866046,PMC1866046_3
