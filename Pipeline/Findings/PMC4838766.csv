"A study involving 34 dogs with chronic diarrhoea found that measuring serum c4 concentration is feasible in dogs and may indicate the presence of bile acid malabsorption, with a cut-off value of 187.2 nmol/l on the receiver operating characteristic curve resulting in a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 25%.",PMC4838766,PMC4838766_0
"The study found that three out of 17 dogs (17.6%) with chronic diarrhoea had a significantly elevated serum c4 concentration, suggesting that bile acid malabsorption may occur in some cases.",PMC4838766,PMC4838766_1
"The study also found that measuring serum c4 concentration may offer a potential screening test to increase clinical suspicion of bile acid malabsorption in dogs with chronic diarrhoea, with a high positive predictive value but a low sensitivity.",PMC4838766,PMC4838766_2
"The study found that there was no evidence of an association between the clinical severity of the disease, as measured by the clinical activity index, and serum c4 concentration.",PMC4838766,PMC4838766_3
"The study also highlighted that measuring serum c4 concentration was feasible in dogs and may indicate the presence of bile acid malabsorption, but larger studies are needed to define the true prevalence in dogs, as the prevalence in this study is speculative.",PMC4838766,PMC4838766_4
