"The study demonstrates that primary human sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs) express functional decin-1 receptors (Dc-sign and Dc-signr) in vivo, providing evidence for their unique antigen-processing and -scavenging properties.",PMC1698775,PMC1698775_0
"The study confirms that HSECs fail to support infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), indicating that Dc-sign and Dc-signr on sinusoidal endothelium provide a mechanism for high-affinity binding of circulating HCV within the liver sinusoids allowing transfer of the virus to underlying hepatocytes, in a manner analogous to dendritic cell Dc-sign presenting HIV to T lymphocytes.",PMC1698775,PMC1698775_1
"The study shows that expression of Dc-sign by HSECs is interleukin-4 (IL-4)-dependent in endothelial cells, as well as in myeloid cells, suggesting that IL-4 is the key cytokine for Dc-sign acquisition during HSEC differentiation.",PMC1698775,PMC1698775_2
"The study provides evidence that IL-4 but not IL-12 or interferon-Î³ increases expression of Dc-sign on HSECs in vitro, indicating that induction of Dc-sign on HSECs will be promoted by Th2 rather than Th1 cytokine responses consistent with the requirement for vigorous Th1 responses to clear viral infection.",PMC1698775,PMC1698775_3
"The study demonstrates that Dc-sign and Dc-signr on sinusoidal endothelium provide a complementary role in trapping HCV within the hepatic sinusoids, suggesting that the local cytokine microenvironment may affect HCV cell attachment and infectivity.",PMC1698775,PMC1698775_4
