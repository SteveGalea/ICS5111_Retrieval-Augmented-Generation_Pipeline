"The study found a high seroprevalence of antibodies to a. Pleuropneumoniae, a recently described group of circular single-stranded DNA viruses, in wild boar populations in Europe and the United States, but serological evidence of exposure to this virus was not detected in the study's population in Saskatchewan, Canada. This finding is noteworthy as wild boar populations in Europe and the United States have very high a. Pleuropneumoniae seroprevalence in comparison to other species, and consumption of infected wild boar has caused outbreaks of toxoplasmosis in humans.",PMC4502852,PMC4502852_0
"The study found a low prevalence of diseases of concern to humans and domestic animals in comparison to wild boar populations in Europe and the United States. Serological evidence of exposure to Leptospira spp. And Salmonella sp. Was also not detected in the study's population in Saskatchewan, Canada. However, increased sample sizes and sampling of wild boar from other areas of the province are needed to demonstrate the absence of disease and ongoing surveillance to detect changes in disease prevalence and to detect the introduction of new pathogens is needed, particularly if wild boar populations in the United States continue their current northern expansion and start to overlap with those in Canada.",PMC4502852,PMC4502852_1
"The study found a high seroprevalence of antibodies to Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 14, a zoonotic pathogen, in wild boar populations in Europe and the United States, but serological evidence of exposure to this virus was not detected in the study's population in Saskatchewan, Canada. This finding is concerning as wild boar populations in Europe and the United States have very high a. Pleuropneumoniae seroprevalence in comparison to other species, and a. Pleuropneumoniae serotype 14 has not been previously reported in North America, and could pose a threat to domestic swine.",PMC4502852,PMC4502852_2
"The study found a low prevalence of diseases of concern to humans and domestic animals in comparison to wild boar populations in Europe and the United States. Low numbers of Trichuris spp. Eggs were found in the feces of 1 of the boar, indicating that Metastrongylus spp. Are highly prevalent in wild boar populations",PMC4502852,PMC4502852_3
