"In Ahvaz, Iran, 48% of broiler chicken flocks were found to be infected with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), despite vaccination.",PMC6198162,PMC6198162_0
"Four new IBV isolates from Ahvaz were identified and clustered with qx-like viruses, indicating the occurrence of this serotype/genotype in the region.",PMC6198162,PMC6198162_1
"The nucleotide sequences of these isolates showed up to 100% homology with qx-like viruses from China, Iraq, and other countries.",PMC6198162,PMC6198162_2
"The findings suggest the spread of qx-like viruses in Ahvaz broiler chickens with respiratory signs, potentially originating from neighboring countries.",PMC6198162,PMC6198162_3
The study highlights the need for rapid identification of new IBV serotypes and genotypes to develop effective vaccination strategies.,PMC6198162,PMC6198162_4
