"The overall seropositivity of avian respiratory diseases in broiler and sonali birds in this study is 37.6%. The highest seropositivity is observed for ort, followed by ibv, while the lowest is seen for art.",PMC6882717,PMC6882717_0
"The seropositivity of ort is higher in both broiler and sonali birds, especially in later ages, indicating the ubiquitous presence of the organism in the study areas.",PMC6882717,PMC6882717_1
"The seropositivity of ibv is also higher in both broiler and sonali birds, but more so in later ages, indicating a larger portion of poultry flock is experiencing new field infection due to the absence of vaccination against ibv.",PMC6882717,PMC6882717_2
"The seropositivity of art is negative in broiler birds, but 12% of sonali birds are found to be positive.",PMC6882717,PMC6882717_3
"The seropositivity of ilt is found to be negative in broiler birds but 2% of sonali birds are found to be positive, indicating a higher prevalence of ilt infection in older age sonali birds.",PMC6882717,PMC6882717_4
"In broiler birds, the highest seropositivity for avian respiratory diseases is observed for ort in jamalpur, followed by ibv in fulbariya and muktagacha.",PMC6882717,PMC6882717_5
"In sonali birds, the highest seropositivity for avian respiratory diseases is also observed for ort, but it is highest in fulbariya, followed by ibv in fulbariya",PMC6882717,PMC6882717_6
