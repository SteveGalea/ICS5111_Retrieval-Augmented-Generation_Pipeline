"Tsb and tsf extracts from t. Sinensis attenuated hepatocellular lipid accumulation through ampk, ppar, and lc3 pathway activation and inhibition of lipogenic protein expression.",PMC6832244,PMC6832244_0
"Both tsb and tsf extracts showed anti-lipogenic activity and improved lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, with either extract showing similar effects.",PMC6832244,PMC6832244_1
"Gallic acid, quercetin, rutin, and toosendanin, active components of t. Sinensis extracts, exhibited anti-steatotic effects on high-fat-diet-fed mice or 3t3-l1 preadipocytes.",PMC6832244,PMC6832244_2
"Tsb and tsf extracts did not cause cytotoxicity, suggesting the potential in targeting steatosis, and both mainly ameliorated lipid accumulation through ampk, ppar, and lc3 pathway activation and inhibition of lipogenic protein expression.",PMC6832244,PMC6832244_3
"The upstream key regulator, including mammalian target of rapamycin and akt, will be examined further to elucidate the anti-steatotic effects of tsb or tsf.",PMC6832244,PMC6832244_4
