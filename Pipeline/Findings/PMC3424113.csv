"This study found that ort, a bacterial pathogen causing airsacculitis in broilers, was isolated and identified in China.",PMC3424113,PMC3424113_0
"The mortality rate in broilers infected with ort was 50%, which is higher than the previously reported rates of 20-30%.",PMC3424113,PMC3424113_1
"Co-infection of broilers with ort and avian influenza virus h9n2 resulted in a mortality rate of 70%, which is significantly higher than the mortality rate of 30% in broilers infected with ort alone.",PMC3424113,PMC3424113_2
"The current study is the first to report co-infection of broilers with ort and h9n2 aiv, which could be associated with the outbreak of broiler airsacculitis in China.",PMC3424113,PMC3424113_3
"The study suggests that further investigation of the resistance and pathogenesis of ort is urgently needed, as ort infections have been occurring frequently in China and can lead to high mortality and economic loss.",PMC3424113,PMC3424113_4
