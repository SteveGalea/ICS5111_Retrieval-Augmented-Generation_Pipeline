"This study identified four possible serotypes of caastv circulating in dogs in the UK alone, raising questions about their possible origins. The high rate of evolution observed in all astroviruses, facilitated by the introduction of point mutations and recombination events, suggests that some caastv strains may be more pathogenic than others, as previously reported for astroviruses of mink.",PMC4401448,PMC4401448_0
"The study revealed significant genetic diversity within the caastv strains, with the first full-length sequences of two caastv isolates determined. Full genome sequencing revealed that the UK strains each grouped with a different caastv isolate from either China or Italy, unlike the grouping of all Chinese strains.",PMC4401448,PMC4401448_1
"The study found a clear relationship between the presence of caastv RNA in stool samples and the presence of clinical signs of gastroenteritis, confirming previous findings from Italy and China. However, the study also found co-infections with other gastroenteric pathogens, such as CPV in dogs 1 and 4, which can confound pathology identification in a clinical setting.",PMC4401448,PMC4401448_2
"The study identified a high rate of evolution observed in all astroviruses, facilitated by the introduction of point mutations and recombination events. The study suggests that some caastv strains may be more pathogenic than others, as previously reported for astroviruses of mink, and raises concerns about future disease control, as the presence of multiple strains will make vaccine design challenging.",PMC4401448,PMC4401448_3
"The study found that the prevalence of caastv in gastroenteritis cases in this study was unexpectedly high given that caastv has not previously been reported in the UK. The majority of previous caastv epidemiological studies have focused on young animals, whereas this study included dogs of any age, highlighting the need to have an index of suspicion for infectious causes of gastroenteritis in dogs of any age.",PMC4401448,PMC4401448_4
