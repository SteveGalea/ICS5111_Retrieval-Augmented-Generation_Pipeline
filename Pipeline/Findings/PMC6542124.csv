"The study found that almost three quarters of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases in Yemen involved non-influenza viruses, including RSV, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and mixed infections (RSV and HMPV), with RSV being predominant. This finding highlights the burden of non-influenza viruses and suggests the need for surveillance for these pathogens.",PMC6542124,PMC6542124_0
"The study also found that children under 15 years old were more likely to have viral respiratory infections, with significantly higher proportions of non-influenza viruses among this group compared to adults. This finding is consistent with previous studies in other EMARS NETWORK countries.",PMC6542124,PMC6542124_1
"The study reported a higher incidence of viral respiratory infections among children under 15 years old compared to adults, with 50% of cases being children in Yemen, which is similar to findings in other EMARS NETWORK countries.",PMC6542124,PMC6542124_2
"The study showed that SARI patients with positive respiratory viruses, including influenza A, influenza B, and mixed infections (RSV and HMPV), were less likely to be admitted to intensive care units (ICU) compared to patients not infected with the same pathogens. This finding is in agreement with findings of a previous study conducted in EMARS NETWORK countries.",PMC6542124,PMC6542124_3
"The study found that SARI patients with positive influenza B virus were less likely to be admitted to ICU compared to patients not infected with the same pathogen, and that influenza B virus positivity was associated with higher fatality outcome, particularly among children under 15 years old. However, the study notes that the current study has some limitations, including the fact that not all SARI cases were tested for viral respiratory pathogens, and testing focused on a limited panel of viral respiratory pathogens, which may have contributed to the lower prevalence of detected viruses among SARI patients compared to previous studies in other contexts.",PMC6542124,PMC6542124_4
