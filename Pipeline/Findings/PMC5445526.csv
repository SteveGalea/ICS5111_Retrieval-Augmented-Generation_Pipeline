"The authors developed highly efficient, genetically encoded, mechanically interlocking spyx modules (axb and bxa) for engineering protein topology in vivo. These modules allow for the formation of protein catenanes, obligate dimers, and star proteins. The configuration of three components, as well as the fused protein of interest, influences the catenation efficiency and stability of the final product. Bxa has better catenation efficiency than axb, and products containing bxa are more stable.",PMC5445526,PMC5445526_0

"The authors demonstrated that the configuration of three components, as well as the fused protein of interest, influences both the catenation efficiency and stability of the final product. Star proteins formed by direct expression using spyx modules have significantly enhanced stability against trypsin digestion.",PMC5445526,PMC5445526_2
