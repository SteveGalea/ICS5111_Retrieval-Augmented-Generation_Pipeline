"Duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) binds to the glycoprotein GP170/p170 through its pre-S region, and this interaction is mediated by the dcpD protein, which is expressed in the golgi apparatus of infected cells.",PMC112890,PMC112890_0
"DHBV binding to dcpD-transfected cells is independent of virus inoculum concentration, suggesting that saturation of the receptor does not occur at the inoculum used.",PMC112890,PMC112890_1
"Internalization of DHBV particles is observed in dcpD-transfected cells, and this is supported by the presence of trypsin-resistant signals in the cells.",PMC112890,PMC112890_2
"The pre-S peptide covering the binding site of three classes of neutralizing mAbs inhibits DHBV binding to dcpD-transfected cells, and this is consistent with the ability of energy-depleting agents to inhibit DHBV entry into cells.",PMC112890,PMC112890_3
"DHBV infection is not restricted to dcpD-transfected cells, as dcpD-reconstituted cells stably expressing low levels of dcpD bind DHBV particles quite well, and this is supported by the ability of energy-depleting agents to inhibit DHBV entry into cells.",PMC112890,PMC112890_4
