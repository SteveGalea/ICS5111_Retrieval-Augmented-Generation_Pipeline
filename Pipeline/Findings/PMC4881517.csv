"Dccov Uae-hku23 was successfully isolated from dromedary fecal samples using hrt-18g cells, and minimal serological cross-antigenicity was observed between dccov Uae-hku23 and Mers-cov.",PMC4881517,PMC4881517_0
"The complete RdRP, S, and N genes of Dccov Uae-hku23 strains were amplified and sequenced using primers designed by multiple alignments of the three complete genome sequences of Dccov Uae-hku23, and the trees for RdRP and N genes were inferred by the gtr + i substitution model and the tree for S gene was inferred by the gtr + i + g model.",PMC4881517,PMC4881517_1
"The leader-body junction sequences for subgenomic mRNAs of Dccov Uae-hku23 and Mers-cov were determined using RT-PCR, and neutralization antibody assays for Dccov Uae-hku23 and Mers-cov n proteins were performed using heat-inactivated Dccov Uae-hku23 dccov Uae-hku23.",PMC4881517,PMC4881517_2
"The phylogenetic trees for RdRP, S, and N genes were constructed by the maximum likelihood method using PhyML, and the genetic distance of the RdRP, S, and N genes of Dccov Uae-hku23 and other wild ruminant CoVs in reference to the RdRP, S, and N genes of Alpaca COV, and this genetic distance was plotted versus nucleotide positions.",PMC4881517,PMC4881517_3
"The leader-body junction sequences for subgenomic mRNAs of Dccov Uae-hku23 and Mers-cov were amplified and cloned into the Ncoi and Xhoi sites of expression vector pET-28b(+) and ndei and noti sites of expression vector pETH, respectively (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). The recombinant N proteins of Dccov Uae-hku23 and Mers-cov were expressed and purified using NI2+-loaded hitrap chelating system (Ge Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), and serum samples were obtained 14 days",PMC4881517,PMC4881517_4
