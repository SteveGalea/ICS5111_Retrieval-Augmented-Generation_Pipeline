"The structure of the hcov-229e fusion core reveals a 24-turn hr1 helix, which is the longest observed so far in published hcov fusion core structures. This finding highlights the importance of developing vaccines or treatments for covs, as the melting temperatures (t m) of α-hcovs, including hcov-229e and hcov-nl63, are significantly and consistently higher than those of β-hcovs, presumably owing to a larger buried interface and a higher affinity between the longer hr2s and 3hr1 cores of α-hcovs.",PMC6130466,PMC6130466_0
The structure of the hcov-229e fusion core also indicates that the high-affinity interaction between hr1 and hr2 of hcov-229e is mediated by both extensive hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. This finding suggests that a good pan-cov inhibitory peptide mimic of hr2 would preserve all of the conserved hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between hr1 and hr2 of all hcovs and also accommodate the variation among different hcovs.,PMC6130466,PMC6130466_1
"The structure of the hcov-229e fusion core shows that the electrostatic surface potentials of 3hr1 cores are opposite in α-hcovs and β-hcovs at some positions. This finding implies that residues on the hr2 inhibitory peptide mimic should be carefully chosen such that they could form contacts, but not electrostatic or steric clashes, with surrounding residues on the 3hr1 cores of different hcovs.",PMC6130466,PMC6130466_2
"The structure of the hcov-229e fusion core indicates that the hydrophobic packing of their 3hr1 cores is similar to each other overall, despite differences in the electrostatic surface potential of 3hr1 cores across different hcovs. This finding reveals substantial differences in the electrostatic surface potential of 3hr1 cores between α-hcovs and β-hcovs at certain positions, at which residues on the hr2 inhibitory peptide mimic should also be chosen such that they could form contacts, but not electrostatic or steric clashes, with surrounding residues on the 3hr1 cores of different",PMC6130466,PMC6130466_3
