"In the section on vaccine development against T. Gondii, the authors highlight the limitations of current vaccine strategies, including the risk of reverting to a virulent form in live-attenuated vaccines and the need for refrigeration in dna vaccines. They also note that previous studies have shown that vaccines expressing only a single antigen or stage of the parasite life cycle generate partial immune protection against T. Gondii.",PMC6702889,PMC6702889_0
"The authors also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of epitope-based vaccines against T. Gondii. They note that this vaccine strategy shows chemical stability, low or lack of resulting immunogenicity during antigen processing and presentation, and decreased biohazard risk. However, they also point out that the prediction and validation of highly immunogenic epitopes is crucial in designing any potential epitope vaccine, and that the variation among epitopic regions may affect the prediction process.",PMC6702889,PMC6702889_1
"The authors provide a list of predicted epitopes evaluated as potential epitope-based vaccine candidates against T. Gondii (Table 1). They also note that recent studies have shown that a synthetic vaccine expressing a mixture of single b and t cell epitopes generated significant immune protection against T. Gondii, including long-term survival rates.",PMC6702889,PMC6702889_2
The authors also mention that the use of epitope-based antigens is highly promising in the development of potential vaccine candidates against T. Gondii and could aid in achieving potential vaccines. They suggest that future studies should explore the use of appropriate adjuvants and establish optimal immunization protocols along with evaluation criteria.,PMC6702889,PMC6702889_3
"The authors also discuss the potential role of bioinformatics in analyzing immunogenic epitopes and predicting potential epitopes. They note that bioinformatics tools represent a powerful alternative strategy in epitopes discovery, as it significantly reduces the cost, time, and effort involved in experimental approaches. However, they also point out that the differences in pathogens genotypes and subtypes should be taken into account while selecting immunogenic epitopes.",PMC6702889,PMC6702889_4
