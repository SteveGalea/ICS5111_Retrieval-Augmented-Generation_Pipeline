"In the districts of Setiu, Hulu Terengganu, and Besut, a total of 42 voucher chiropteran were collected, with some species being newly recorded in the area.",PMC6262155,PMC6262155_0
"The abundance of bats varied across sites, with the highest number recorded at Saok Waterfalls in Hulu Terengganu.",PMC6262155,PMC6262155_1
"The mean forearm length and weight of the voucher chiropteran were measured, and the body condition index (BCI) was calculated using the weight-to-length ratio. This index can indicate whether the bat is underweight, ideal, overweight, or obese.",PMC6262155,PMC6262155_2
"The study found that some chiropteran species in the area are potential carriers of pathogens such as Carey Island Virus, Jugra Virus, Japanese Encephalitis Virus, Nipah Virus, Phnom Penh Bat Virus, Sindbis Virus, Leptospira bacteria, and SARS-CoV.",PMC6262155,PMC6262155_3
"The study also revealed that some chiropteran species in the area have ecological significance as pollinators, and their habitat preferences and guilds were documented, including aerial insectivores, carnivores, frugivores, insectivores, and nectarivores. Diversity indices such as Shannon, Simpson, Evenness, Menhinick, and Margalef were calculated to profile bats by abundance, diversity, and richness at each site.",PMC6262155,PMC6262155_4
