"The incidence of laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis (tb) in Taiwan has remained relatively stable, while the prevalence of definite diagnosis has increased gradually during recent years. This suggests that improved accuracy of diagnosis by healthcare facilities may have contributed to the stabilization of tb incidence.",PMC2483710,PMC2483710_0
"Among the tb patients, most cases of tb infection in Taiwan are males, which is consistent with previous studies that have noted gender differences in tb incidence and progression. However, no gender difference was observed in the number of days of delay in treatment.",PMC2483710,PMC2483710_1
"The current study revealed that more men than women experienced long delays in treatment. This gender difference may partly reflect epidemiological differences, including differences in exposure, infection risk, progression from infection to disease, socio-economic status, cultural factors, and quality of healthcare received.",PMC2483710,PMC2483710_2
"The study also found that long delays in treatment usually occurred in hospitals, possibly due to not all physicians being familiar with tb treatment, especially in hospitals with many specialists. To minimize treatment delays and disease transmission, the protocols for controlling tb at the hospital level must be strengthened, and nurses responsible for hospital tb control should be informed immediately after a laboratory diagnosis is confirmed.",PMC2483710,PMC2483710_3
"The study found that delayed treatment increases the risk of transmission, and improving the protocol for managing confirmed tb cases can minimize disease transmission. The possibility of multiple-drug resistant tb (mdr-tb) cannot be considered due to the lack of information in the data set, but based on reports from chest hospitals in Taiwan, multidrug resistance occurred in 42.8% of retreated tb patients, and 1.8% of multidrug resistant isolates were found in new tb patients from January 2002 to June 2004. A recent report in May 2008 revealed that, among 215 patients with mdr-tb, 42.8% were fluoroquinolone-resistant. This treatment regimen of using fluoroquinolone before definite diagnosis of pulmonary tb might cause treatment delay and drug resistance. Further studies are needed to examine the extent of fluoroquinolone-resistance in patients with long treatment delays.",PMC2483710,PMC2483710_4
