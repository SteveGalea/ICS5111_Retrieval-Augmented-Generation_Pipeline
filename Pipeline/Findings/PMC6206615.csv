"In humans, cCHFV infection results in a sudden onset of severe disease, including hemorrhagic manifestations, followed by death within 14 days in 30-60% of cases. Survivors can have persistent fatigue, cognitive impairment, and arthralgia for months to years.",PMC6206615,PMC6206615_0
"CCHFV is transmitted to humans through the bite or contaminated body fluids of infected ticks, primarily of the hyalomma species, which are found in rural areas of eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Middle East, and northern and western Africa.",PMC6206615,PMC6206615_1
"The clinical presentation of CCHFV infection can be confused with other diseases, such as malaria, dengue, and yellow fever, making timely diagnosis and treatment difficult.",PMC6206615,PMC6206615_2
"In mice, CCHFV infection results in a sudden onset of severe disease, including hemorrhagic manifestations, followed by death within 14 days in 30-60% of cases. Survivors can have persistent fatigue, cognitive impairment, and arthralgia for months to years.",PMC6206615,PMC6206615_3
"In humans, CCHFV infection can cause persistent fatigue, cognitive impairment, and arthralgia for months to years after the acute phase.",PMC6206615,PMC6206615_4
"In mice, CCHFV infection can be prevented or treated with antiviral medications, such as ribavirin and favipiravir, but treatment needs to be started early in the course of disease to have clinical benefit due to the rapid progression to severe, hemorrhagic manifestations.",PMC6206615,PMC6206615_5
"In humans, the mortality rate of CCHFV infection is around 30-60% despite intensive supportive care, and the case fatality rate is highest in older adults, males, and those with underlying medical conditions.",PMC6206615,PMC6206615_6
"In humans, CCHFV infection can cause a range of immune responses, including thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.",PMC6206615,PMC6206615_7
