"Diagnosis of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection was confirmed in four patients through positive reverse transcription (RT)-PCR results, viral loads, and isolation of the virus from acute-phase sera in 2006. The outbreak was associated with the Indian Ocean region, and a new variant was identified through mutations in the e1 gene. The viral loads were high, up to 3.3 x 109 copies/ml, and severe arthralgia and tenosynovitis with pain on pressure were observed. Late-to-chronic chikv rheumatic manifestations were also reported.",PMC3290960,PMC3290960_0
"The variant identified in the Indian Ocean region was genetically heterogeneous compared to strains in the east/central Africa lineage, with specific amino acid mutations in the e1 gene. The variant emerged recently and dispersed in the region, leading to an epidemic pattern.",PMC3290960,PMC3290960_1
"Chikv infection was transmitted through direct contact with highly viremic blood, potentially without the need for an animal reservoir, in accordance with the ecologic cycle of the virus and its vector in the region, which is similar to that seen in dengue fever.",PMC3290960,PMC3290960_2
"The diagnosis of chikv infection in a healthcare worker was associated with contact with the blood of a patient returning from the region during the outbreak, although the vector did not generally bite in southern France during winter. The quantification of viral loads through rna, which encompasses the target region, provided a good reflection of biologic reality, although in the absence of published data, high viral loads were uncommon in arthropodborne viral diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus infection. High viremia was observed, which enabled virus isolation from all viremic patients.",PMC3290960,PMC3290960_3
