"A new enterovirus genotype, ev-104, was identified through genomic analysis of respiratory diseases in adults and children. This virus belongs to the hev-c species and is genetically distinct from all other serotypes of the species. The virus shows no evidence of recombination with other hev-c strains and does not grow in cell culture.",PMC2687021,PMC2687021_0
"The design of the study and technical issues, such as the limited amount of clinical specimens and the use of different screening methods, limited the representativeness of the sequence collection. As a result, the study identified a previously unknown enterovirus genotype, ev-104, and constant discovery of new picornavirus genotypes is expected due to undetectable viruses by conventional methods and overly restrictive molecular tools.",PMC2687021,PMC2687021_1
"The study identified two clinical isolates of 40 viruses analyzed over a 9-year period as recombinants. Their breakpoints were identified within the 5'-untranslated region sequence and the n terminus of protein 3c, respectively. These findings provide new insight into the genomic diversity and ability of rhinovirus to evolve in its natural host, and the fact that only 2 of 40 analyzed viruses over a 9-year period were recombinants is suggestive of a lower recombination frequency in rhinoviruses than in other picornaviruses.",PMC2687021,PMC2687021_2
"The study showed that rhinovirus evolves by recombination in its natural host, and recombination breakpoints in picornaviruses are restricted to nonstructural regions of the genome or between the 5'-untranslated region sequence and the capsid-encoding region. These findings are consistent with the fact that recombination breakpoints in picornaviruses are mainly the result of in vitro experiments, and interspecies recombination is rare in picornaviruses.",PMC2687021,PMC2687021_3
"The study identified a divergent rhinovirus (13) and assigned it to the new hrv-c species, thus limiting currently to 3 the number of hrv species. For the sake of simplicity, the study proposes to consider this virus as a member of the hrv-c clade. These findings provide new insight into the genomic diversity and ability of r",PMC2687021,PMC2687021_4
