"A study on porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) identified that the PRRSV n protein inhibited the production of type I interferons (IFNs) in vitro, and this effect was mediated by blocking the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in IPEC-J2 cells (Li et al., 2017).",PMC6052364,PMC6052364_0
"The study found that the PRRSV n protein inhibited the induction of IFN-λ, but not type I IFNs, in IPEC-J2 cells.",PMC6052364,PMC6052364_1
The study revealed that the PRRSV n protein caused a blockade of IFN-λ induction through activation of NF-κB in IPEC-J2 cells.,PMC6052364,PMC6052364_2
The study suggested that PRRSV n protein might contribute to virus escape from mucosal immunity in the intestine by inhibiting IFN-λ production through preventing the activation of NF-κB in IPEC-J2 cells.,PMC6052364,PMC6052364_3
"The study indicated that the PRRSV n protein shared similar motifs, structural features, and functions with the n proteins of other coronaviruses, as previously reported (Laude and Masters, 1995; Schelle et al., 2005).",PMC6052364,PMC6052364_4
