"The complete genome sequence analysis of ark dpi reveals a close relationship with cal99, as shown by phylogenetic tree analysis.",PMC2628353,PMC2628353_0
"The s1 gene of ark dpi is probably derived from ark 99, and the recombination between jmk and ark 99 had taken place presumably between the conserved region and the intergenic region of s gene.",PMC2628353,PMC2628353_1
"The structural genome of ark dpi, except the spike gene, belongs to the conn strain.",PMC2628353,PMC2628353_2
"The ark dpi strain originated from the conn strain, but diverged and evolved independently by point mutations and recombination between field strains.",PMC2628353,PMC2628353_3
Most of the genetic diversity among currently circulating ibv serotypes comes from genetic changes already existing in the ibv field strains and from ibv live vaccines.,PMC2628353,PMC2628353_4
