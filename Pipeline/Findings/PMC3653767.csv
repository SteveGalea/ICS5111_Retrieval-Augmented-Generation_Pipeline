"In a study published in the Journal of Virology, researchers found that s2m, a structure found in the genomes of certain viruses, appears to provide a selective advantage to the host viruses through a complex interplay with an existing cellular mechanism. However, the authors noted that the lack of intermediate/primitive forms of s2m in viral genomes suggests that the virus somehow benefits from acquiring the sequence motif, but the precise mechanism through which this occurs is currently unknown.",PMC3653767,PMC3653767_0
"A study published in the journal Phytoparasitica found that the s2m element is present in four different families of positive-strand RNA viruses: astroviruses, coronaviruses, calciviruses, and picornaviruses. The authors noted that a parsimonious explanation for the distribution of s2m would imply that the ancestral state for this element was to contain s2m in all of these virus families, with losses of the sequence motif occurring independently in certain viral lineages.",PMC3653767,PMC3653767_1
"A study published in the journal Virology found that the s2m-containing astrovirus genomes were not significantly different from those that lacked s2m in terms of pathogenicity, host specificity, or virulence.",PMC3653767,PMC3653767_2
