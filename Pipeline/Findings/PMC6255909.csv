"Oral administration of ll-il35, a multifunctional anti-inflammatory protein, in the form of recombinant lactococcus lactis (ll-il35) reduces inflammation and neutrophil infiltration into joints of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice, preventing the onset or stopping the progression of the disease.",PMC6255909,PMC6255909_0
"LL-il35 treatment of CIA mice stimulates the production of anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs), including both CD39+ and CD39- subsets, which secrete high levels of interleukin (IL)-10, a cytokine that suppresses inflammatory responses.",PMC6255909,PMC6255909_1
"LL-il35 treatment of CIA mice reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-Î³ and interleukin (IL)-17, which are elevated in the CIA model.",PMC6255909,PMC6255909_2
"LL-il35 treatment of CIA mice stimulates the production of IL-10 by both CD39+ and CD39- regulatory T cell subsets, which are the primary sources of this anti-inflammatory cytokine.",PMC6255909,PMC6255909_3
"LL-il35 treatment of CIA mice, administered as an oral dose, is less invasive than traditional injections of recombinant protein, and is cost-effective because it eliminates the need for labor-intensive efforts needed to produce and purify the protein, as well as the need for daily oral doses, which are required to control autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and psoriasis.",PMC6255909,PMC6255909_4
"LL-il35, a dimeric protein, is a multifunctional anti-inflammatory protein that can be delivered using lactococcus lactis as a vector, making it an ideal tolerogen delivery platform for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, as it is a lab-adapted recombinant strain originally derived from an industrial dairy strain that can ferment milk into a product that has the same textural and olfactory properties of yogurt.",PMC6255909,PMC6255909_5
