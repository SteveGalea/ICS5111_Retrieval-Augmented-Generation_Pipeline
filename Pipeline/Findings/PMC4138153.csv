"In a study of over 4,000 adults living in multi-story apartment buildings in Sweden, researchers found that dampness problems in homes were associated with more respiratory illness, including current rhinitis, infection rhinitis, and respiratory infections in the last three months. This association was stronger for those born before 1943, potentially due to differences in indoor environment exposure and attitudes towards odors.",PMC4138153,PMC4138153_0
"The study also found that building dampness and molds were associated with current asthma and used antibiotic medication for respiratory infections in the last 12 months among adults less than or equal to 65 years old, but no significant association was found among adults more than 65 years old. This could be due to differences in the effects of dampness problems and renting apartments between elderly and others in Sweden, potentially related to differences in indoor environment exposure and attitudes towards odors.",PMC4138153,PMC4138153_1
"The study found that subjects living in buildings constructed during 1976-1984, which had particular indoor exposures and were the first generation of buildings in Sweden with low ventilation due to increased energy saving demand and testing of new building materials on a large scale, had elevated levels of health problems observed in the study.",PMC4138153,PMC4138153_2
"The study also found that higher window-opening time (higher window-opening index) was associated with increased risk of day time breathlessness and night time breathlessness, potentially related to polluted outdoor air entering the indoor environment when opening windows.",PMC4138153,PMC4138153_3
"The researchers found that reported building dampness in homes was associated with doctor-diagnosed asthma and current asthma, and that reported odor perception in dwellings was also associated with doctor-diagnosed asthma and current asthma. However, the negative or positive attitudes to odors may (cognitive bias) influence the occurrence of irritative symptoms on experimental exposure to odorous compounds, potentially related to differences in personal factors or attitudes towards odors.",PMC4138153,PMC4138153_4
