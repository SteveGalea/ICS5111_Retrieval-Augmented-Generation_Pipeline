"The study identified a previously uncharacterized disulfide bond in the receptor for several cytokines, including interleukin-4, interleukin-7, and interleukin-11, which is involved in the function of the receptor.",PMC3352089,PMC3352089_0
The study found that mild reduction of this disulfide bond inhibited proliferation of an IL-2-dependent T cell clone and the activation of the STAT-5 pathway.,PMC3352089,PMC3352089_1
"The study demonstrated that a disulfide bond in the receptor for several cytokines, including IL-4, IL-7, and IL-11, is at the interface with the cytokine and is involved in the function of the receptor.",PMC3352089,PMC3352089_2
