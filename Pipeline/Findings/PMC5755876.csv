"With the increased vaccine coverage rate, there was an additional decline in the incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) in 2005 and 2006, but this was only observed in vaccine-eligible children and not in older children who were not enrolled in the influenza vaccination program.",PMC5755876,PMC5755876_1
"The study provides additional evidence of the efficacy of tiv against AOM, with data from 803,592 children over the period October 2000 through March 2007 analyzed, and outpatient visits in seven consecutive influenza seasons studied.",PMC5755876,PMC5755876_2
"The study identified a significant decline in the incidence of outpatient visits with AOM in children < 2 years old, who were enrolled in the free influenza vaccination program launched by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 2004-2006.",PMC5755876,PMC5755876_3
"The study found that, in addition to the direct protection provided by the vaccination, tiv may have induced some herd immunity that further contributed to the reduction in influenza attack rates and the rates of associated AOM in children < 2 years old.",PMC5755876,PMC5755876_4
