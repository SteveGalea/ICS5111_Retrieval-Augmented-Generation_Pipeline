"The ns1 protein of influenza virus is a key regulator of host cell metabolism and inflammation, which inhibits host cell mRNA transcription and translation, and suppresses inflammasome activation, leading to reduced host cell inflammatory responses (1-3).",PMC4810543,PMC4810543_0
"The ns1 protein of influenza virus interacts with nlrp3 and inhibits a single-speck formation, which is required for full activation of inflammasomes, thereby inhibiting nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated secretion of IL-1β (47).",PMC4810543,PMC4810543_1
"The ns1 protein of influenza virus does not dissipate mitochondrial membrane potential (δΨ(m)) and does not change the expression levels of nlrp3 or δΨ(m), but instead, inhibits inflammasome activation by interacting with nlrp3 (29, 47).",PMC4810543,PMC4810543_2
"The ns1 protein of influenza virus inhibits inflammasome activation by different mechanisms, as the bm/1918 ns1 protein, which has an intact CPSF30-binding site that blocks host mRNA maturation, suppresses expression of nlrp3, thereby abrogating nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion (fig. 6).",PMC4810543,PMC4810543_3
"The ns1 protein of influenza virus plays a key role in inhibition of rig-i and nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion from nonimmune cells such as lung epithelia, as viruses utilize many strategies to inhibit inflammasome activation (1-3, 40, 47, 49-53).",PMC4810543,PMC4810543_4
