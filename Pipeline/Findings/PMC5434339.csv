"A retrospective analysis of 335 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infection caused by human coronavirus (hCoV) found that hCoV infection is associated with high rates of respiratory support and mortality, similar to rates seen with established respiratory pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus, in immunocompromised hosts.",PMC5434339,PMC5434339_0
"The study, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, identified all four known hCoV strains in lower respiratory tract samples, and found that hCoV infection in lower respiratory tract can contribute to poor clinical outcome in this population.",PMC5434339,PMC5434339_1
"The analysis showed that mortality rates associated with hCoV lower respiratory tract infection in transplant recipients were similar to those seen with other respiratory viral pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus.",PMC5434339,PMC5434339_2
"The study also found that hCoV lower respiratory tract infection is significantly associated with poor clinical outcome, such as prolonged oxygen requirement, in this population.",PMC5434339,PMC5434339_3
The findings suggest that hCoVs are highly prevalent in immunocompromised hosts and that hCoV lower respiratory tract infection should be considered a significant respiratory pathogen in these populations. Further studies are needed to clarify if particular hCoV strains and viral load are correlated with clinical outcome and to identify risk factors for progression to lower respiratory tract infection.,PMC5434339,PMC5434339_4
