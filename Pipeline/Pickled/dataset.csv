pmc2666320,"tsa, a biomarker commonly used in humans to monitor feline coronavirus  fcov  infection, can be easily detected in feline serum using a spectrophotometric method. the method is precise and accurate at tsa values commonly encountered in feline blood, but not at low tsa values due to high inter-assay variability. tsa levels are increased in cats with neoplastic and inflammatory diseases, confirming results reported in species other than felines. tsa cannot be used to support a diagnosis of inflammation or of fcov infection, except in the case of very high results or in cats where the pre-test probability of fcov infection is very high. the rate of fcov infection was low in cats with high tsa and vice versa, supporting the hypothesis that tsa can have a role in resistance to fcov infection."
pmc3197180,"the study found that preventive behavior, such as hand washing and wearing facemasks, can significantly reduce the spread of influenza, in addition to the effectiveness of traditional control strategies enforced by health agencies. the study suggested that a low-level combination of traditional control strategies and individual preventive behavior is sufficient to contain seasonal influenza epidemics, as a high-level combination is no longer necessary. the study recommended that health agencies should gain prior knowledge about behavioral patterns of local people before choosing influenza control strategies. the study called for a review of current control strategies and re-estimate the health resources that are necessary to contain epidemics. the study suggested that individual self-initiated behavior can change the fate of an outbreak, and its combined effectiveness with control strategies requires proper understanding if we are to fully comprehend how these control measures work."
pmc4306608,"the liposome-based immunoprecipitation system  lips  has been shown to have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to classic solid-phase assays for detecting antibodies against multiple antigens from different viruses, such as epstein-barr virus  ebv , human immunodeficiency virus  hiv , and human t-lymphotropic virus  htlv . lips has been used to identify novel infectious agents, such as hmoastv-c, a nonprimate homolog of hepatitis c virus, in animals, and to determine their impact on health. lips has allowed for the simultaneous measurement of antibody levels against multiple target proteins in infectious and autoimmune diseases, such as hiv, hcv, and ebv, in infected subjects compared to uninfected controls. lips has been used to identify individual exposure profiles to multiple infectious agents, which may influence human health, and to define disease-specific antibody profiles in chronic diseases, such as hiv and systemic lupus erythematosus  sle , which may allow for the early detection of these diseases before clinical onset. lips has the potential to provide in vivo evidence of infection, which may accelerate the discovery of new pathogens obtained from nucleic acid discovery efforts, by allowing for the identification of animal reservoirs of human-related viruses, such as middle east respiratory syndrome  mers  virus, which may cause zoonotic infections in humans."
pmc1448678,"the study found that hmpv, a recently discovered respiratory virus, is associated with approximately 15% of respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children in central israel who are negative for other common respiratory pathogens during the two winter seasons studied. the study revealed that hmpv infection presents with a clinical picture similar to bronchiolitis caused by rsv, with symptoms ranging from mild self-limiting respiratory illness to severe illness requiring mechanical ventilation. the study showed that hmpv group 1, the predominant serotype circulating, had the highest circulation rate  92% of sequenced samples  among the four subgroups reported, followed by subgroup 1b  65%  and subgroup 2b  10% . the study found that hmpv seroprevalence increases with age, reaching 100% within the age group of 5 to 14 years olds, and then decreases in individuals older than 14 years, ranging from a low of 72% in the age group of 20 to 49 to a high of 80% in individuals older than 60 years of age. the study highlighted that the viral genetic lineages and the prevalence of hmpv infections in central israel have been identified, allowing the identification of a significant number of respiratory tract infections, and more upper respiratory tract infections will be identified when sensitive diagnostic techniques are developed and routinely applied, particularly for testing common respiratory pathogens such as rhinoviruses and coronavirus."
pmc6810026,"of 1703 children enrolled in the emergency department with respiratory symptoms, 697 were positive for both rhinovirus  rv  and enterovirus by multiplex pcr. among children with rv monoinfection, there was no difference in mean viral load between those admitted and discharged from the emergency department. among admitted children with rv monoinfection, there was no difference in mean viral load between those requiring supplemental oxygen and those not requiring supplemental oxygen. children co-infected with rv and respiratory syncytial virus  rsv , metapneumovirus  mpv , or parainfluenza  piv  had lower nasal viral loads than those with rv alone. in 525 sequenced samples, the mean viral load was not different between the three rv viral species  rv-a, rv-b, rv-c ."
pmc6307628,"the study found that respiratory tract infections  rtis  were the most common antenatal complication among pregnant indian pilgrims during hajj, with 51.75% of women experiencing rtis. the study found that iron deficiency anemia  ida  was a common antenatal complication, with 17.54% of women experiencing ida. the study found that missed abortions  23.68%  and threatened abortions  8.77%  were the most common early pregnancy outcomes, with 27  23.68%  missed abortions and 2  10.53%  threatened abortions occurring among the women. the study found that there were a total of 22 births  19.3%  during the study period, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.4 1. neonatal outcomes were good in 19 cases  86.36% , but there were also cases of birth asphyxia and neonatal resuscitation. the study found that pregnant women who perform hajj pilgrimages while pregnant have a high risk of abortion, respiratory infections, and various antenatal and neonatal complications, which may go untreated. medical missions should educate patients of these risks and advise them to postpone the pilgrimage until after the pregnancy."
pmc2683306,"the patient presented with progressive dyspnea and fatigue, with a history of high-grade prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, and asbestos exposure. chest radiograph and ct scan revealed diffuse airspace opacities, ground-glass opacities, and pleural thickening consistent with pulmonary congestion and crazy-paving appearance, attributed to left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. laboratory analysis and bronchoscopy were negative for infection and pathological changes, respectively. the patient's clinical course and rapid improvement with diuretic therapy supported the diagnosis of pulmonary congestion secondary to heart failure. coronary angiography revealed severe three-vessel coronary artery disease, and coronary artery bypass grafting was recommended."
pmc3894647,"in a study comparing the circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone in male sprague–dawley rats housed in red-, blue-, or clear cages, the peak amplitude in the red group was significantly lower than that in the clear group, but all groups exhibited a long-duration square wave elevation in corticosterone levels that revealed a peak at the end of the light phase. in another study examining the rhythm of plasma leptin in male sprague–dawley rats housed in blue- or clear-caged groups, the peak melatonin levels in the blue group were higher than those in the clear group, but the leptin peak was significantly lower. a study investigating the circadian rhythm of plasma total fatty acids in male sprague–dawley rats housed in red-, blue-, or clear cages found that the peak amplitude in the red group was delayed by 8 hours, and the peak lactate levels in the red group were lower than those in the clear group, whereas the leptin peak was significantly higher. in a study examining the circadian rhythm of plasma insulin in male sprague–dawley rats housed in red-, blue-, or clear cages, the peak insulin levels in the red group were lower than those in the clear group, but the leptin peak was significantly higher. a study comparing the circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone in male sprague–dawley rats housed in red-, blue-, or clear cages found that the peak amplitude in the red group was significantly lower than that in the clear group, but all groups exhibited a long-duration square wave elevation in corticosterone levels that revealed a peak at the end of the light phase."
pmc3694681,"the authors propose a novel method, multi-task pathway logistic regression  mtpl , to predict interactions between human proteins and proteins from bacterial species based on the commonality hypothesis, which suggests that the pathway memberships of human proteins from interactions should be similar across tasks. mtpl utilizes pathway information from databases like reactome and pid to construct a pathway-based objective biology representation, where a human protein can be a member of multiple pathways based on the biological processes it is involved in. the authors define a pathway-summary function, s, which aggregates all pathway vectors for a given task to summarize the pathway memberships. the authors perform enrichment analysis on the human pathways from the positive predictions of mtpl and find that 17 pathways are commonly enriched across all four bacterial species, indicating that the regularizer produced by mtpl produces predictions satisfying the commonality hypothesis. they also find that 104 pathways are enriched across the three high-throughput datasets, which is a significant fraction of the total number of pathways considered. the authors analyze the overlap between the pathways enriched in the gold-standard positives and those enriched in the predictions and provide details in the supplementary section. the authors use the cccp algorithm to optimize the objective function, which has a difference-of-convex functions form and uses the logistic loss terms, the pathway summary function, and the regularizer terms to achieve a non-convex objective function. they implement the cccp algorithm, which was originally introduced by yuille and rangarajan  2003 , to optimize this function."
pmc5643837,"the study found that mers-cov, a highly pathogenic virus, has a basic reproduction number  r  less than one in saudi arabia, indicating a subcritical epidemic that cannot lead to self-sustaining transmission in humans. this is supported by other studies that have reported similar findings. the study identified that the highest incidence of mers-cov cases was detected in the western and central regions of saudi arabia, followed by the eastern region, with limited human-to-human transmission due to variations in mers-cov receptors in the human upper and lower respiratory tract. the study found that the confidence intervals  ci  for the estimated r values varied considerably across the studied period in different regions, with reduced ci indicating more related secondary cases rather than sporadic case incidences. the study suggests that animal contact is an uncommon cause for mers-cov infection in the detected cases and that mild/asymptomatic cases, if detected, could reveal factors other than inter-human transmission that affect the mers-cov spread pattern. the study highlights the need for appropriate monitoring of cases, enhanced traceability procedures, and periodic updates of the r value to reduce transmission rate, diminish any possible opportunity of viral adaptation to human-to-human transmission, and obtain reliable data for future outbreak events in saudi arabia."
pmc2315644,"in the study ""effectiveness of mindfulness-based therapy in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety,"" the authors found that mindfulness-based therapy significantly reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety in participants with these disorders. in the article ""the impact of social media use on mental health,"" the authors identified that excessive use of social media is associated with increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and poor sleep quality. in the review ""cognitive behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety disorders  a systematic review,"" the authors concluded that cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective treatment for both depression and anxiety disorders. in the research paper ""the association between childhood trauma and mental health outcomes,"" the authors discovered that individuals with a history of childhood trauma are at higher risk for developing mental health disorders in adulthood. in the article ""the effectiveness of exercise in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety,"" the authors established that regular exercise can significantly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety."
pmc4130433,"the current ebola virus disease outbreaks in africa have persisted over the years, with the first reported case in 1976 in sudan and the democratic republic of the congo  drc . since then, outbreaks have been identified in several african countries, including guinea, liberia, sierra leone, and the democratic republic of the congo  drc  in west africa, as well as in other regions such as central africa, east africa, and southern africa. the outbreaks in guinea, liberia, and sierra leone in west africa have resulted in a total of 460 cases with 339 fatalities, as of march 21, 2014. the ebola virus disease outbreaks in africa have presented challenges and opportunities in responding to emerging infectious diseases, including neglected tropical diseases  ntds  prevention, control, and management, as well as health system coverage and service delivery bottlenecks. these challenges and opportunities have included widespread ignorance, lack of knowledge, and potential panic over ebola virus disease, resulting in trepidation, isolation, dignity impoundment, stigmatization, and ostracism from associated socio-ecological and public health consequences. to combat ebola virus disease outbreaks and other emerging infectious diseases, there is an urgent need for accelerating the response through the provision of minimum essential information on risk communication for behavioral impact, developmental communication and health promotion/education personnel and communities, working in multidisciplinary teams to respond to the disease outbreaks. this includes harnessing all stakeholders' collaboration, communication, and networking, including communities, to improve community participation, informal and formal health education, ownership, and empowerment of the programs and to ensure human rights for all ages at all levels. the development of new tools, strategies, and approaches, such as improved diagnostics, novel therapies including vaccines, is needed to prevent, control, and contain ebola virus disease and other emerging infectious diseases, such as sars, bird flu, lassa fever, dengue, and mers outbreaks. developing surveillance response systems against emerging infectious diseases and controlling and eliminating ntds, as well as early warning and emergency systems, cannot be overemphasized. concerted actions to empower communities"
pmc6468216,"in saudi arabia, breast cancer is the most common cancer among saudi arabian women.  instruction  this finding is important because it highlights the need for increased awareness and resources for breast cancer screening and prevention programs among saudi arabian women.  the incidence rate of hepatitis b in saudi arabia has decreased by 30.6% from 2003 to 2016.  instruction  this finding is important because it indicates a decrease in the incidence rate of this infectious disease, which may be attributed to effective prevention and control measures.  the prevalence of diabetes among saudi arabian men and women has increased significantly from 1970-1979 to 2015-2016.  instruction  this finding is important because it highlights the need for increased awareness and resources for diabetes screening, prevention, and management programs among saudi arabian men and women.  the incidence rate of dengue fever in saudi arabia has increased significantly from 2004 to 2016.  instruction  this finding is important because it indicates a significant increase in the incidence rate of this infectious disease, which may require further investigation and measures for prevention and control.  the prevalence of obesity among saudi arabian children has increased significantly from 1990-1999 to 2015-2016.  instruction  this finding is important because it highlights the need for increased awareness and resources for obesity screening, prevention, and management programs among saudi arabian children.

pmc3130781,"ceacam1 is a protein expressed on the cell surface of t cells that plays a role in t cell activation, trafficking, and proliferation. mice deficient in ceacam1 exhibit increased t cell activation and proliferation, as well as increased numbers of t cells in various organs. ceacam1-deficient t cells also exhibit increased sensitivity to radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, potentially due to decreased radiation-induced apoptosis. ceacam1-deficient mice also have increased numbers of t cells in the liver, potentially due to decreased radiation-induced apoptosis in liver t cells. ceacam1-deficient t cells show decreased radiation-induced apoptosis in gut epithelial cells, potentially due to decreased wnt signaling in these cells. ceacam1-deficient t cells also exhibit increased numbers of t cells in the skin, potentially due to decreased apoptosis in skin t cells. ceacam1-deficient t cells show decreased activation and proliferation in response to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells  hscs , potentially due to decreased hsc-derived t cell homing to the liver and skin. ceacam1-deficient mice also exhibit increased sensitivity to radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity in response to allogeneic hscs, potentially due to decreased hsc-derived t cell homing to the liver and skin. ceacam1-deficient t cells show decreased activation and proliferation in response to allogeneic hscs, potentially due to decreased hsc-derived t cell homing to the liver and skin. ceacam1-deficient t cells also exhibit decreased activation and proliferation in response to allogeneic hscs in the liver and skin, potentially due to decreased hsc-derived t cell homing to these organs. ceacam1-deficient mice also exhibit decreased activation and proliferation in response to allogeneic hscs in the liver and skin, potentially due to decreased hsc-derived t cell"
pmc1618487,"in a study examining the spread of infectious diseases on random and scale-free networks, it was found that in random networks, epidemic spread is much slower, and the average degree of new infectious nodes is close to the average degree k=〈k〉. this is due to the relatively slow time-scale of the disease and the virtually degree-independent spread of the disease, which helps contact tracing to follow the disease closely and to control it if the tracing rate is high enough. in scale-free networks, the disease turnover time is fast, and the disease preferentially spreads to nodes with high degree. however, highly connected nodes are typically traced at a later disease stage, and only ‘intelligent’ tracing  for example through prior knowledge of who may be most highly connected  would be effective. examination of disease transmission on different network topologies can help identify trademark signatures of different disease models spreading on different network architectures. the average degree of exposed and traced nodes is delayed with respect to the degree of traced and infectious nodes in scale-free networks. this is directly connected to the latency period, since infectious nodes traced at a given time in the epidemic represent a set of nodes that were infected on average a time lat_p earlier in the epidemic, and therefore are of higher average degree than the traced and exposed nodes. while epidemic spread on scale-free networks has recently been the subject of much interest, to our knowledge there has been no quantitative comparison of the differences in disease control efficacy on scale-free and random networks. the main advantage of contact tracing on both network types is that it can make a real difference if the tracing rate of susceptible nodes is low. however, should contacts between nodes be highly clustered, the removal of susceptible nodes can reduce the local susceptible neighbourhood surrounding infectious nodes, rendering it an effective means of disease control. in a study examining disease transmission on different network topologies, it was found that a major role in infectious disease spread is played by the underlying contact structure. however, in most cases, the exact contact structure is difficult to determine. understanding how to best use the available data about a network on which disease can spread in order to better prevent or control epidemics is, therefore, imperative. the study suggests that by analyzing disease"
pmc3528286,"the study describes the isolation and characterization of a novel alpaca coronavirus, named acov, during an outbreak of severe respiratory disease and associated abortions in alpaca in 2007. similarities between the whole genome sequences of acov and human coronavirus 229e, a virus first isolated around 1960, suggest a transmission event between humans and alpacas. molecular studies suggest the possibility that the speculative transmission event between humans and camelids was recent, as the evolutionary ancestor appears more closely related to hcov-229e viruses isolated around 1960, and acovs may have been circulating for decades at low levels in alpaca populations. most alphacoronaviruses, including acov, utilize aminopeptidase n, a host receptor, and host tropism differences of viruses are caused by the ability of their spike proteins to detect small species-specific amino acid differences in the aminopeptidase n. despite the host specificity of this receptor, all of those viruses are known to bind and utilize feline aminopeptidase n, suggesting a common coronavirus ancestor infecting feline species around 1960. the study suggests that vaccines targeting betacoronaviruses will likely not prevent infection with alphacoronaviruses, such as acov, due to the different cell entry mechanism. the spike gene has the critical role of virus entry and membrane fusion processes in the host cell, and evolutionary studies monitoring hcov-229e strains suggest the mutation patterns can be associated with geographic origin, rather than with virulence patterns. the study provides strong evidence of an evolutionary relationship between hcov-229e and acov, and whether the virus represents a recent cross-species transmission or a more distant transmission between humans and alpacas is yet to be determined. the study suggests that the acov has an extra putative orf “x” overlapping the 3' end of the nucleocapsid gene, and further laboratory experiments will be required to determine if this gene is expressed and whether"
pmc5021412,"the study identified imatinib, a drug initially approved by the us food and drug administration  fda  to target the bcr-abl protein in leukemia, as a potent inhibitor of replication of both sars-cov and mers-cov viruses. the study found that imatinib inhibited the early stages of the viral life cycle for both sars-cov and mers-cov viruses, suggesting that imatinib exerts its action after viral entry but prior to viral genome replication. the study demonstrated that an sirna-mediated knockdown of the abl2 protein, but not abl1, resulted in a decrease in virus replication for both sars-cov and mers-cov viruses, suggesting that the abl2 protein is required for efficient virus replication. the study identified abl2 as a novel host cell protein involved in coronavirus virion replication and hypothesized that abl2 is required for virion fusion at the endosomal membrane by a mechanism that is under investigation. the study found that treatment with imatinib, even though abl2 is in its open, active conformation, prevented phosphorylation of downstream targets, as atp is unable to bind in the active site, and as a consequence, the kinase activity of abl2 is inhibited, preventing phosphorylation of proteins targeted by abl2."
pmc6433989,"an atg5 homolog from orange-spotted grouper  ecatg5  was cloned and its roles during fish virus infection were investigated. ecatg5 encoded a 275-amino acid protein that shared 94% and 81% identity to seabass  lates calcarifer  and humans  homo sapiens , respectively. ecatg5 functions as an e3 ligase-like enzyme and is involved in many metabolic pathways among the tissues. ecatg5 promoted sgiv and rgnnv replication by positively regulating autophagy activity and negatively regulating antiviral ifn responses. ecatg5 affected cell cycle progression from the g1 to the s phase and arrested cells in the g1 phase. ecatg5 down-regulated expression levels of several interferon related cytokines or effectors and negatively regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory factors."
pmc3147911,"in a study examining the molecular epidemiology of canine parvovirus  cpv  in the united kingdom, researchers found that despite the global spread of cpv-2, only cpv-2a and cpv-2b viruses were circulating in the united kingdom, and the majority of viruses did not cluster based on these key amino acid mutations. the study also identified 50 different dna sequence types in the 150 viruses analyzed, with 32 unique amino acid sequences identified, indicating limited opportunities for global transmission of cpv. the study revealed that within the united kingdom, there was evidence of significant geographic clustering in some areas, such as the most prevalent virus in the liverpool region, which was present over a period of two years and rarely found elsewhere. this suggests that some cpv sequence types may have restricted opportunities for spread, even within countries. the variability in the full cpv vp2 gene sequence enabled the researchers to investigate the molecular epidemiology of these viruses at the national level. they found that although the majority of viruses clustered based on key amino acid mutations, neither cpv-2a nor cpv-2b type was monophyletic, suggesting that in the united kingdom at least, the 2a/2b phenotype may have evolved on several occasions. the study also identified two unique amino acid mutations within the united kingdom samples, at residues 139 and 274, which form part of the beta barrel inside the virus and are found on the 3-fold spike, a region of high antigenicity, respectively. the significance of these mutations, however, remains unknown. the study found that all of the potential vaccine breakdowns, which were included in the study, were distinct and showed no consistent mutations, suggesting that there is no group of viruses circulating within the united kingdom that is specifically capable of evading vaccine-induced immunity. this is in agreement with a range of studies that have shown that currently available vaccines protect against the full range of antigenic types identified to date."
pmc4930163,"the study found that the basic reproductive number  r0 , which is the average number of new infections generated by a single infected individual in a susceptible population, is lower in the study population than previously reported results for influenza a virus. the study observed that a higher fraction of dead cells at the end of infection is associated with longer infection durations and greater symptom scores auc, as indicated by the model. the study found that treatments acting on the infection rate or viral production rate are most effective when given before the time of peak viral load, as the model predicts. the study suggests that treatments acting on the virus clearance rate are more effective after the peak viral load, as the model predicts, especially when given before the time of peak viral load. the study recommends taking at least two to three measurements per day, if possible, for fitting mechanistic models of acute viral infections to data, as the measurement error and sensitivity of assays can significantly impact estimates of infection-related quantities."
pmc3332201,"viruses, including bacteriophages, can be visualized under an electron microscope due to their small size and simple composition. they can be found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. bombyx mori cypovirus 1, a nonenveloped virus, enters the midgut cells of silkworms by recognizing and attaching to the plasma membrane of microvilli, resulting in membrane disruption and virion penetration through the microvilli. severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  coronavirus, an enveloped virus, enters vero e6 cells by attaching to the cell surface and fusing its envelope with the cell membrane, allowing the nucleocapsids to enter the cell. bacteriophages overcome the barrier of cell walls by releasing their genome into bacteria through the portal pore located at one vertex of the capsid, followed by the ejection of the inner core through the tail hub. viruses take advantage of the structures of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells to enter them. enveloped viruses enter cells by membrane fusion, while nonenveloped viruses enter through penetration and endocytosis vesicles. bacteriophages use tails to bind to the cell and eject their genome into the host cell."
pmc3298297,"the study found that viral load was high in the febrile period and in patients with pneumonia, with children under the age of 13 years having a significantly longer viral shedding period than older children, even after oseltamivir therapy. the study demonstrated that the duration of viral shedding in pandemic  h1n1  2009 infection was notably longer in children under the age of 13 years than in older children, even after oseltamivir therapy. the study indicated that younger children  under the age of 13 years  may require a longer isolation period than older children, even after oseltamivir therapy. the study suggested that patients with pneumonia may require more aggressive treatment for infection with pandemic  h1n1  2009 virus. the study highlighted that children under the age of 13 years had a significantly longer viral shedding period than older children, even after oseltamivir therapy, which may have implications for the length of isolation required."
pmc4863113,"nbaecp, a nonberberine active ingredient from the traditional chinese medicine c. phellodendri, can inhibit high k+-induced precontractions in healthy and asthmatic airway smooth muscle by inhibiting l-type ca2+ channels. nbaecp can also inhibit precontractions in small bronchial smooth muscle, indicating its potential as a bronchodilator for asthmatics. nbaecp partially inhibits ach-induced contractions in airway smooth muscle by inhibiting l-type ca2+ channels and trpc3 and/or stim/orai channels, but the exact inhibitory mechanism requires further investigation. nbaecp has similar inhibitory roles in both healthy and asthmatic airway smooth muscle, suggesting its potential as a new inhibitor of asthma attacks. nbaecp can inhibit whole airway smooth muscle contractions, as shown by experiments conducted in both healthy and asthmatic smooth muscles."
pmc5356426,"the study found that most camels imported to egypt from sudan and east africa were seropositive for mers-cov  88.7%  and virus genetic materials was detected in 5.3%  39/738  of the imported camels. surprisingly, no human cases of mers-cov infection have been recorded among camel traders from these countries, which may be due to the lack of diagnostic tools and experience for virus detection or maybe due to the rarity of virus transmission from camels to humans. the study also revealed that mers-cov has become ubiquitous in egypt, as the virus is not a newly emerged virus but has only recently been discovered, and it has been circulating for at least three decades. the study found that 91.4% of camels imported from sudan and 75.8% of resident camels were seropositive for mers-cov antibodies. analysis of the results based on age showed that adult camels had higher seroprevalence of mers-cov antibodies  87.3%  compared with young camels  51.8% , and the number of confirmed pcr-positive mers-cov animals was significantly higher in females than males  p<0.05 . nucleotide sequencing of the amplicons from 15 of 41 pcr-positive samples for mers-cov genetic material, followed by phylogenetic analysis, showed that the sequences recovered in the current study in egypt were distinct from those in clade a and b. this finding adds to the knowledge of host range of mers-cov, as except one sheep, all the 109 bats in the study were negative for mers-cov using both serology and molecular assays. the study found that the dromedary camel was the most likely source of mers-cov transmission to humans, as the virus has been circulating in camels for at least three decades, and it is not a newly emerged virus but has only recently been discovered. the study also revealed that the virus may have become ubiquitous in egypt, as inter-market movement and transport stress may partially explain the higher seropositivity and molecular analysis results in samples obtained from the"
pmc362132,"poliomyelitis, a disease that afflicted humans since ancient times, emerged as an epidemic disease due to improved sanitation, causing a delay in infection until later in life when the risk for paralysis is greater. west nile virus, known to cause epidemics in the western hemisphere, originated from a virus isolated in uganda in 1937 but was not encountered in the western hemisphere until 1999. sin nombre virus, the cause of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, is endemic in the deer mouse population and emerged in humans during a large crop of piñon nuts in 1992-93 due to an increase in the deer mouse population. the emergence of lyme disease followed a similar course, with the infection being present in north america for millennia but only emerging as an epidemic in the northeastern us in the 20th century due to changes in conditions favoring propagation. the re-emergence of dengue virus, previously eliminated from most of central and south america, is attributed to the end of mosquito-eradication programs in the 1970s, resulting in the reintroduction of the virus into the caribbean, the pacific, australia, and the indian subcontinent, as well as its appearance for the first time in china, venezuela, and brazil."
pmc4411640,"the current study in coastal kenya reports a mean duration of rsv shedding of 13.5 days in symptomatic cases, which is higher than previous estimates in other settings. this observation raises questions about the relationship between virus infectiousness and shedding duration and warrants further work relating virus load to shedding duration. the study reveals instances where negative samples arose within rsv infection episodes, even though participants were sampled every 3-4 days regardless of symptoms. this observation suggests that alternative estimation of shedding patterns by calculating the area under the viral load curve might have some additional advantages and should be explored in future. the study finds that prolonged rsv shedding enhances the possibility of person-to-person transmission and makes young children a potential source of community spread of infection, with important implications in the control and prevention of rsv infection. the study observes an interaction between detection of other viruses, such as coronavirus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus in the nasopharynx and rate of recovery from rsv infection. this interaction might be a marker of low immunity associated with poor viral clearance. the study finds that individuals with lower respiratory tract infection shed for longer than those with upper respiratory tract infection, but evidence is controversial on the link between disease severity and viral load. the study reports a prolonged rsv shedding of over 3 weeks' duration in 24  13.4%  individuals, most  70.8%  of whom had symptomatic episodes. these findings suggest that rsv shedding might be repeat infection or persistence and have potential importance on our existing view of acute rsv infection, the development of immunity, and effects on viral transmission. the study observes that individuals aged less than 2 years shed rsv for longer than those aged 2-16 years  1.98 vs. 1.82 times faster . this finding suggests that age might act as a proxy of exposure to rsv in earlier epidemics and highlights the need for further work to explore the relationship between age and rsv shedding duration. the study finds that rsv episodes with concurrent spread in the household were associated with increased recovery rate. however, any conclusions"

pmc4838766,"a study involving 34 dogs with chronic diarrhoea found that measuring serum c4 concentration is feasible in dogs and may indicate the presence of bile acid malabsorption, with a cut-off value of 187.2 nmol/l on the receiver operating characteristic curve resulting in a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 25%. the study found that three out of 17 dogs  17.6%  with chronic diarrhoea had a significantly elevated serum c4 concentration, suggesting that bile acid malabsorption may occur in some cases. the study also found that measuring serum c4 concentration may offer a potential screening test to increase clinical suspicion of bile acid malabsorption in dogs with chronic diarrhoea, with a high positive predictive value but a low sensitivity. the study found that there was no evidence of an association between the clinical severity of the disease, as measured by the clinical activity index, and serum c4 concentration. the study also highlighted that measuring serum c4 concentration was feasible in dogs and may indicate the presence of bile acid malabsorption, but larger studies are needed to define the true prevalence in dogs, as the prevalence in this study is speculative."
pmc111476,"the study found that mice lacking cd4+ t cells had less severe central nervous system  cns  inflammation and demyelination following infection with the cns-tropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus  mhv  than wild-type controls. this suggests a central role for cd4+ t cells in the early stages of cns disease following viral infection in the amplification of inflammation and, ultimately, demyelination by promoting the entry of macrophages into the cns. the study identified rantes as a chemokine that plays a prominent role in both regulating leukocyte entry into the cns and contributing to the pathogenesis of mhv-induced cns inflammation and demyelination. rantes expression is compromised in cd4-deficient mice, resulting in lower levels of mrna transcripts and protein than in cd8-deficient and wild-type mice. this decrease in rantes levels correlates with the reduced severity of macrophage infiltration and demyelination in the cns of cd4-deficient mice. the study found that mice treated with neutralizing anti-rantes antibodies had delayed viral clearance from the cns and decreased cellular infiltration, similar to the phenotype observed in cd4-deficient mice. this supports the argument that targeting chemokines may be a novel therapeutic intervention strategy to treat human cns inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis  ms . the study suggests that rantes exerts a potent chemotactic effect on both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells as well as macrophages, and its expression is compromised in cd4-deficient mice, resulting in lower levels of mrna transcripts and protein than in cd8-deficient and wild-type mice. this decrease in rantes levels correlates with the reduced severity of macrophage infiltration and demyelination in the cns of cd4-deficient mice. the study supports and extends earlier studies that have suggested that targeting chemokines may be a novel therapeutic intervention strategy to treat human cns inflammatory diseases, including ms. rantes expression"

pmc4845099,"the authors identified a crucial structural difference between the bl2 loops of mers-plpro and sars-plpro that explains the selectivity of inhibition. this structural difference is the presence of a deubiquitinating function in mers-plpro, whereas sars-plpro has a deisubiquitinating function. the authors determined the crystal structure of mers-plpro and found that it is similar to that of sars-plpro, with the exception of the bl2 loop. the bl2 loop of mers-plpro differs significantly from that of sars-plpro, as it is more flexible and can adopt multiple conformations, whereas the bl2 loop of sars-plpro is in a fixed conformation. the authors determined the catalytic activity of both mers-plpro and sars-plpro and found that the catalytic efficiency  kcat/km  of sars-plpro is ∼45-fold higher than that of mers-plpro. the authors performed a high-throughput screening of a library of 25,000 compounds against both mers-plpro and sars-plpro and identified a dual noncovalent inhibitor against mers-plpro. this inhibitor was selective for mers-plpro over sars-plpro due to the structural differences in the bl2 loops of these enzymes. the authors performed an inhibitor selectivity assay against both mers-plpro and sars-plpro and found that the inhibitor selectivity was due to the structural differences in the bl2 loops of these enzymes. this assay involved testing a lead sars-plpro inhibitor  i-1  and two human ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolases  uch-l1 and uch-l3  and two unrelated enzymes  hepatitis c virus ns3 serine protease and b. anthracis dihydroorotase  using a fluorometric assay."
pmc5857709,"in a survey of 400 singaporeans, most participants reported a high tolerance for interventions that curtail individual liberties, such as isolation and quarantine, both strategies that have been used in recent history in singapore. this finding highlights the need for policy makers to consider the preferences and trade-offs between known interventions and known outcomes of those interventions, as decisions about how to respond to public health threats must continue to be based on scientific advice and political imperatives at an early stage of an outbreak of a novel pathogen, where policy makers face grave uncertainty about the outcomes of interventions because the characteristics of the pathogen’s transmission routes and potential, the severity and symptoms of the disease it causes, and the public reaction is unpredictable. the survey revealed that the preferences of the population level are not uniform, and participants could be broadly categorized into two groupings  one group  mortality averse  was strongly motivated to reduce the number of deaths and willing to accept interventions that did so, whereas another  expenditure averse, 37% of the respondents  was tax averse, and not in favor of any measures that might increase their taxes, even at levels comparable to the per capita costs of singapore’s routine dengue vector control program. the survey found that two such examples emerged   1  temperature screening island-wide received considerable support by the survey participants, although temperature screening at the country’s main airport was estimated only to pick up around one imported case in 2009, and  2  the predicted risk of infectious disease outbreaks was considerably underestimated  2013 saw approximately 2,000 dengue infections in singapore, but the mean forecast risk of an outbreak infecting at least 200 people was a mere 29%. the survey revealed that future studies might evaluate the effect of priming respondents with accurate public health information before eliciting their preferences, as information from such surveys could be used to explain the rationale for particular decisions, with hierarchical cluster analysis used to support the targeting of different messages to audiences with different values. the survey highlighted that decisions about how to respond to public health threats must continue to be based on scientific advice and political imperatives at an early stage of an outbreak of a novel pathogen, where policy makers face"

pmc5319820,"in a study investigating the evolution of 19 viruses from diverse eukaryotic hosts, the authors utilized a normalized phylogenetic tree topological distance, implemented in the program nelsi v0.1, to quantitatively measure the extent of virus-host co-divergence. the authors calculated the normalized phylogenetic tree topological distance, referred to as the 'nph85' distance, by comparing the tree topologies for viruses and their corresponding hosts. the nph85 distance, which utilizes two phylogenetic trees as its input, describes the number of bipartitions  clades  that are not shared between two tree topologies. the authors also reconciled the co-phylogenetic relationship between viruses and their hosts to address phylogenetic uncertainty, using the jane co-phylogenetic software package, which uses a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to find optimal solutions to reconcile co-phylogenies. in the same study, the authors utilized the 'untangle' function, which rotates the branches of one tree, to minimize the number of crosses lines between trees connecting the host  left  with its virus  right . if viruses and hosts have congruent topologies, then the number of crossed lines, and hence cross-species transmission events, will be reduced. the authors also examined the evolution of the hepadnaviridae in more detail as this family contains the best evidence for co-divergence. they reconciled the co-phylogenetic relationship between viruses and their hosts to address phylogenetic uncertainty, using the jane co-phylogenetic software package, which uses a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to find optimal solutions to reconcile co-phylogenies. the authors excluded certain virus and host genetic sequence data either due to lack of available data or because they were unable to obtain a reliable alignment of sufficient length for phylogenetic analysis. the authors provided a summary of the virus and host diversity included and excluded in this study in a table. the authors calculated the number of randomizations required to obtain the maximum topological distance  black lines  for the hepadnaviridae and the parvoviridae phylogenies, which"
pmc5325537,"this retrospective study, conducted over a 3-year period in a french pediatric hospital, highlights significant variations in respiratory viruses' prevalence and distribution among children in hospital settings compared to adults. children in neonatal units presented lower positivity and viral coinfection rates than children in pediatric units, with an overrepresentation of picornavirus among all populations. in pediatric units, influenza and rsv were never the majority group of viruses identified in children using multiplex pcr  mpcr  or rsv-specific testing, respectively. the study also revealed that even when clinical symptoms led physicians to request rsv-specific testing, only 31.3% of negative rsv-specific tests were positive for another respiratory virus when tested by mpcr. this highlights that rsv testing is badly suited for respiratory viruses' detection in all children populations and may lead to non-optimal care decisions such as unnecessary antibiotic use, laboratory testing, radiological exams, or hospitalisations. the study underlines that the lack of a complete respiratory viruses' detection may lead to non-optimal care decisions such as unnecessary isolation or an underestimation of nosocomial epidemics. a monitoring in real-time of all respiratory viruses, only possible by a larger use of mpcr, may help identify and explore more closely specific epidemics. the study shows that the use of mpcr tests has led to huge improvements in respiratory viruses' detection, allowing better cohorting decisions, especially for severe respiratory viruses such as influenza and rsv, but also para-influenza or metapneumovirus. viral co-infections, frequent among children, may also be more easily detected, allowing better cohorting decisions. the study emphasises the number of undiagnosed respiratory viruses according to the current diagnosis practice in france and gives a better picture of respiratory viruses identified in hospital settings by mpcr all over the year. these findings are of importance in order to have a better opinion and view of the diagnosis missed by the current practice in france, where only rsv and influenza-specific testing are recommended during epidemic periods, and no testing at all outside these periods. the lack"
pmc112004,"the authors developed a helper-dependent adenovirus  hd ad  vector for delivering the interferon  ifn -α2 gene to the liver, which showed higher efficiency and greater therapeutic potency than a first-generation ad vector carrying the same expression cassette. hd-ifn injection resulted in high levels of liver ifn-α2, which was dose-dependent and observed even at the lowest hd-ifn dose, which did not result in circulating ifn-α2. hepatic expression of ifn-α2 led to liver protection in 80% of c57/b6 mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus  mhv-3 , and the reason why not all of the hd-ifn-injected mice were protected from mhv-3 challenge remains elusive. the authors observed no liver histology alterations in mice pretreated with hd-ifn, indicating that injection of hd-ifn had no negative effects on the liver tissue that could be ascribed to mhv-3 replication in association with the inflammatory response. the authors believe that local delivery of ifn-α to the liver tissue with hd ad vectors might be a promising approach for the treatment of chronic hepatitis."
pmc4200475,"in the context of a travel group to saudi arabia, a common source of infection for both case 1 and 2 cannot be identified. however, exposure to camels and dairy products cannot be ruled out as a possible source of infection. in the context of hospital visits, infection of case 1 can be attributed to exposure during a visit to a hospital in medina. however, infection of case 2 cannot be attributed to a specific hospital visit, as exposure to a common source of infection for both case 1 and 2 cannot be excluded. in the context of travel group, asymptomatic infection among the accompanying travellers cannot be excluded, although the number of travellers is too small to draw definite conclusions. in the context of epidemiological studies among a well-defined group of travellers, the exact source of infection remains difficult to identify, due to uncertainty in the source. however, the suggested role of underlying disease to develop mers-cov infection is in line with the age and comorbidity of the two dutch cases and the absence of symptomatic mers-cov infection among the younger and healthier travellers. in the context of laboratory testing, ongoing serological analysis among parts of the viral genome collected from both patients and asymptomatic infection among the remaining travellers cannot be excluded, although the number of travellers is too small to draw definite conclusions."
pmc3386620,"in the context of chronic disease, regulatory t cells  tregs  play a beneficial role in limiting collateral damage without delaying viral clearance. for example, in the case of neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus  mhv  infection, tregs are critical in ameliorating clinical disease and demyelination, particularly during acute infection when maximum viral antigen is present. in contrast, in the case of mhv strain j2.2, which causes mild acute encephalitis and chronic demyelination, virus-specific tregs are present in the virus-infected central nervous system and, based on concurrent detection with virus-specific effector cd4+ t cells and identification within the naïve t cell precursor pools in the spleen and lymph nodes, are presumed to arise from the natural treg pool. these virus-specific tregs express il-10 and ifn-γ upon stimulation with viral peptide and suppress proliferation of cognate-epitope specific effector cd4+ t cells."
pmc3329045,"in the context of sars-cov, traditional public health interventions, such as case finding and isolation, quarantine of close contacts, and enhanced infection control measures in healthcare settings, were effective in containing the spread of the virus. these measures also contained a smaller sars outbreak in 2004 that originated from a laboratory-acquired infection. limited information exists on the relative effectiveness of methods of providing information on sars  or other illnesses  to travelers. for inbound travelers who may have been exposed to sars, such information should include what to do if symptoms develop and the need to inform healthcare workers who provide care for them in advance to take appropriate precautions. in the context of sars, contact tracing was facilitated by its relatively long serial interval and incubation period. most infections did not lead to further transmission, although a small number of ""super-spreading"" events occurred in which single unrecognized cases transmitted to many people, usually in hospitals or households, before appropriate infection control precautions were in place. in the context of sars, transmission occurred primarily in healthcare or household settings, with close person-to-person contact. cases among children were uncommon, and children did not seem to be involved in transmission. for countries lacking specific countermeasures, such as drugs and vaccines, nonmedical public health interventions may be the only measures available to combat epidemics. decisions regarding implementation should be based on expert scientific advice from who and national authorities; the epidemiologic features of the disease and available resources should be taken into account."

pmc1782895,"the study found that the periphery of thymectomized old mice has a lower representation of peripheral virgin t cells compared to young mice. this suggests that bone marrow is a primary site for memory t-cell trafficking and prolonged localization, as memory t cells preferentially home to the bone marrow rather than to lymph nodes. the study showed that both antigen-specific cd4 and cd8 t cells migrate to the bone marrow after immunization and can still be found there several weeks later. this finding, together with the observation that memory-phenotype t cells preferentially home to the bone marrow rather than to lymph nodes, suggests that bone marrow is an important site of memory t-cell trafficking and prolonged localization. the study found that the percentage of cells showing a functional response to stromal cell-derived factor 1α  sdf-1α , a potent chemoattractant for haemopoietic progenitor cells, is higher in the memory t-cell subset than in the virgin t-cell subset. this suggests that memory t cells involved in the second pathway, which controls t-cell migration to internal organs, also recirculate through the bone marrow. the study found that the cells constantly circulating in the lymphoid periphery, with a memory phenotype, preferentially migrate to the bone marrow. this implies that the bone marrow compartment for t cells is limited and saturable, and that the cells are displaced by other rival t cells competing for the same enclosed 'niche'. the study found that il-15 and il-7 might provide survival/proliferation signals to memory cd8 t cells in the bone marrow, and that these cells persist in the bone marrow for enough time to receive these signals. this suggests that the bone marrow is a site for memory t-cell survival/proliferation, and that these cells return to the periphery from the bone marrow as they are displaced by other rival t cells competing for the same enclosed 'niche'."

pmc3594242,"a new adenovirus vector, based on the bonobo virus panad3, was tested as a potential ""universal"" influenza vaccine candidate. this vector, when used to express conserved influenza virus antigens, had highly effective protection against lethal challenge with mouse-adapted a/fm, with greatly reduced morbidity and mortality compared to controls. the panad3 vector induced both antibody and t cell responses to np, as well as antibody responses to the fusion protein of np with m1, which is a prominent target of t cell immunity in humans. prior immunization with a gfp-expressing construct blocked subsequent responses to the transgene product only for homologous vector, with minimal cross-blocking. human sera containing high anti-ad5 neutralizing activity  >1000  showed no or marginal neutralization capacity on panad3, while human sera with high ad5 neutralizing activity  >1000  had no or marginal neutralization activity on panad3 as well. the panad3-npm1 vaccine, when used to express conserved influenza virus antigens, had promise as a ""universal"" influenza vaccine candidate, as it was highly effective at inducing t cell and antibody immunity, while at the same time having the advantage that it is not neutralized by human sera."
pmc4941702,"a study by alborzi et al.  2009  found that during the 2009 hajj pilgrimage in saudi arabia, there was a low burden of pandemic  h1n1  influenza, despite the large number of pilgrims from affected areas. this low burden was attributed to the implementation of preventive measures, such as vaccination and quarantine, prior to travel. a report by khan et al.  2011  revealed that during the pandemic  h1n1  2009, there were low rates of transmission of respiratory viruses among pilgrims in saudi arabia, possibly due to the high effectiveness of preventive measures implemented during the hajj. a study by mangili et al.  2009  showed that during the 2009 hajj, nasal swabs were found to be as effective as nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens for detection of respiratory viruses, potentially simplifying the process of virus detection in large crowds. a report by olsen et al.  2003  indicated that during commercial air travel, transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  could be prevented by implementing thermal image scanning, which can detect febrile individuals and prevent them from boarding flights. a study by lessler et al.  2010  found that during the 2009 pandemic  h1n1 , the low burden of infection among travelers returning from affected areas was likely due to the effectiveness of preventive measures, such as quarantine, prior to travel."
pmc6189363,"in the context of respiratory diseases, cd9+ b cells secreting interleukin-10  il-10  are associated with better lung allograft outcomes after lung transplantation through creating a favorable environment for the graft by reducing the inflammation leading to chronic lung dysfunction. in the context of cancer, cd9 expression is overexpressed on glioblastoma stem cells compared to its expression in healthy brain tissues, opening new therapeutic avenues for cd9 as a target for glioblastoma treatment, especially because xenotransplantation of cd9-silenced glioblastoma stem cells into nude rats promotes prolonged survival. in the context of bacterial infectious diseases, the use of anti-cd9 is tested for its anti-adhesive properties to inhibit bacterial adhesion to keratinocytes and has been shown to be effective in a tissue-engineered model of human skin infected with staphylococcus aureus. in the context of asthma, the adoptive transfer of cd9+ b cells normalizes airway inflammation and lung function by inhibiting th2- and th17-driven inflammation in an il-10-dependent manner, which restores a favorable immunological balance in lung tissues. in the context of lung transplantation, the use of molecules, such as statins, upregulating tetraspanin cd9 in macrophages and allowing decreases of inflammation are under consideration for therapeutic intervention."

pmc6315842,"the concept of interconnection and interdependencies between living organisms was recognized as early as 350 bc by aristotle, who documented differences and similarities in the form, function, and purpose of parts in animals and humans, leading to the creation of a taxonomic system. the 1860s-1870s marked the development of the germ theory, leading to the discovery of specific causative agents of diseases, including tuberculosis, cholera, and anthrax, by louis pasteur, robert koch, and others. the one health approach has evolved over centuries, with macrocycles of understanding built around contemporary scientific knowledge. the theory of humours, based on the underlying belief that health is governed by a complex interaction between factors that are both internal and external to the human body, landed on scientific evidence only around the 16th century. the contribution and interdependency of ecosystem health to the health of humans and animals received full recognition in early 2000, leading to the emergence of eco-health as a natural expansion of the germ theory to include ecological aspects. the one health concept is expected to encompass more and more disciplines as new interfaces are discovered and become accessible, as the ever-evolving focus of the one health approach has brought us today to concentrate on emerging and re-emerging zoonotic infections, including those linked to antimicrobial resistance."

pmc2981880,"a new approach to vaccine discovery is needed due to the limited number of known vaccine antigens and the complexity of the factors mediating protein immunogenicity, including host-side properties, pathogen-side properties, protein expression levels, sub-cellular location, aggregation state, and the possession of post-translational danger signals. a concerted and far-reaching effort is necessary to address this issue, starting with the identification and prioritization of potential vaccine antigens using emerging antigen databases and then developing empirically-based, statistically-grounded approaches to predict the role of these factors in mediating protein immunogenicity. the program tasked with such a confounding task is called vaxijen, which deconstructs the antigen presentation pathway, building models for each step and then integrating them into a fully functional model. vaccines are a good thing, but we need to find new ways of making them, such as using peptide vaccines or vaccines based on apcs, which are important new directions for research in vaccine discovery. many of the pathogens responsible for current recalcitrant and emergent diseases are much more complicated functionally and structurally, and cellular location, and their immunogenicity arises from many factors, including host-side properties, pathogen-side properties, protein expression levels, sub-cellular location, aggregation state, and the possession of post-translational danger signals. the reason for the failure to predict protein immunogenicity is comparatively simple  we cannot hope to capture what is necessary for prediction by looking at a single contributory factor, since protein immunogenicity arises from many factors. factors mediating protein immunogenicity include host-side properties, such as the possession of b-cell epitopes or t-cell epitopes, pathogen-side properties, protein expression levels, sub-cellular location, aggregation state, and the possession of post-translational danger signals. predicting such diverse properties remains challenging, but several contributing factors can be reliably predicted, such as the prediction of subcellular location, the prediction of protein expression levels, and the prediction of protein aggregation state. no one method is universally applicable"
pmc6174282,"the study found that diagnostic testing for community-acquired pneumonia  cap  was concordant with international guidelines in only a small proportion of patients. over-testing and under-testing were common issues, with the latter more frequently encountered in north america than in europe. the study revealed a significant geographic variation in diagnostic testing strategies, with blood cultures and viral testing being underutilized in africa. this could be attributed to the limited laboratory infrastructure and the seasonality and epidemiological relevance of respiratory viruses in the region. the study highlighted the low sensitivity of blood cultures for revealing the aetiology of cap, with only 6.7% of blood cultures yielding a positive result. bal cultures, on the other hand, showed a high diagnostic yield of 38.8%. the study found that the discordance between real-life diagnostic testing and international guidelines was mainly due to over-testing. this could be explained by the restrictive testing recommended by the international guidelines. the study suggested that the extensive ordering of diagnostic tests, even beyond what is recommended by the european respiratory society  ers  guidelines, by european and north american clinicians, warrants further investigation, as the significant discrepancies between real-life diagnostic testing and international guidelines recommendations could have important clinical and economic implications."

pmc6433886,"endosymbiosis, the uptake of bacteria by eukaryotic cells, led to the evolution of organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts through gene transfer and loss. this process involves the reduction in genome size and the acquisition of essential metabolic functions from the host cell. retroviruses, which are capable of integrating into the host genome, can contribute to genetic complexity through gene transfer and the acquisition of functional elements. they have also been proposed to have a role in the evolution of cells through gene loss and gain. viruses, including retroviruses, are not only pathogens but also major drivers of evolution through the transmission of genetic material and the promotion of innovation. they can cause disease when environmental conditions change, but the majority of viruses do not cause harm. the concept of evolution through large changes, such as endosymbiosis or pathogen infections, is gaining recognition as a basis for evolutionary theory. this is in contrast to the traditional view of evolution through gradual changes by mutations. the contribution of viruses to the evolution of life since at least 550 million years ago is supported by numerous examples, including the origin of life, the evolution of cells, and the promotion of innovation. however, the question of whether viruses are our oldest ancestors remains a subject of debate."

pmc3694142,"in a study investigating the potential of using recombinant adenovirus  rabv , vaccinia  vsv , and nanoparticle-delivered simian virus 40  ndv  as vaccines against hiv-1 gag, it was found that heterologous combinations of these vectors were able to enhance immune responses primed by each other. this suggests that a vaccine regimen with rabv-gag prime, ndv-gag boost #1, and vsv-gag boost #2 would be a strong candidate for further study in mice and macaques, with the addition of envelope proteins to stimulate humoral responses. the study also showed that ndv-gag and vsv-gag elicited the strongest post-boost immune responses, likely due to the induction of type i interferon responses, while vsv-gag primed mice had the highest responses post-challenge. the functional profile of the cells induced in the immune responses was determined by analyzing the expression and co-expression of ifn-γ and tnf-α, which was proportional to the magnitude of the immune response induced post-boost. the study also found that ndv-gag was able to efficiently boost gag-specific cd8+ t cell responses after rabv-gag priming, but vsv-gag failed to do so, suggesting differences in the pattern of cytokine induction. the challenge studies in mice with more emphasis on the function of cd8+ t cells showed that all prime-boost regimens generated significant recall responses compared to naive controls, with mice that had been boosted with ndv-gag having a lower cd8+ t cell response compared to rabv-gag and vsv-gag boosted mice."
pmc1933289,"a small cell-permeating peptide inhibitor, d-jun kinase inhibitor-1  d-jnki-1 , selectively prevents phosphorylation and activation of c-jun and reduces neuronal apoptosis following reovirus type 3  t3  infection in vitro. infection with t3a or t3d in mice, followed by d-jnki-1 treatment, results in a dramatic reduction in t3-induced apoptosis, neuronal cell death, and tissue injury in vivo, leading to prolonged survival of infected mice. inhibition of jun kinase activation with d-jnki-1 in t3a-infected neurons is greatly diminished with jun kinase inhibition alone, suggesting that jun kinase activation is important in virus-induced apoptosis and that inhibition of jun kinase with a small peptide inhibitor that prevents phosphorylation results in diminished apoptosis and decreased mitochondrial release of proapoptotic proteins. d-jun kinase inhibitor-1 therapy does not alter viral titer or distribution of viral antigen in mice infected with t3, indicating that injury from viral infection does not result merely from viral replication but from the associated activation of a variety of host cell signaling events that ultimately lead to cell dysfunction or death. targeted inhibition of jun kinase activation during neuroinvasive viral infection may provide a neuroprotective effect that could reduce infection-associated morbidity, such as neuropsychiatric changes, seizures, paralysis, weakness, parkinsonism, or other movement disorders, by inhibiting a process that the virus actively induces following infection, thereby reducing or slowing the ability of the virus to spread to neighboring cells."
pmc2687021,"a new enterovirus genotype, ev-104, was identified through genomic analysis of respiratory diseases in adults and children. this virus belongs to the hev-c species and is genetically distinct from all other serotypes of the species. the virus shows no evidence of recombination with other hev-c strains and does not grow in cell culture. the design of the study and technical issues, such as the limited amount of clinical specimens and the use of different screening methods, limited the representativeness of the sequence collection. as a result, the study identified a previously unknown enterovirus genotype, ev-104, and constant discovery of new picornavirus genotypes is expected due to undetectable viruses by conventional methods and overly restrictive molecular tools. the study identified two clinical isolates of 40 viruses analyzed over a 9-year period as recombinants. their breakpoints were identified within the 5'-untranslated region sequence and the n terminus of protein 3c, respectively. these findings provide new insight into the genomic diversity and ability of rhinovirus to evolve in its natural host, and the fact that only 2 of 40 analyzed viruses over a 9-year period were recombinants is suggestive of a lower recombination frequency in rhinoviruses than in other picornaviruses. the study showed that rhinovirus evolves by recombination in its natural host, and recombination breakpoints in picornaviruses are restricted to nonstructural regions of the genome or between the 5'-untranslated region sequence and the capsid-encoding region. these findings are consistent with the fact that recombination breakpoints in picornaviruses are mainly the result of in vitro experiments, and interspecies recombination is rare in picornaviruses. the study identified a divergent rhinovirus  13  and assigned it to the new hrv-c species, thus limiting currently to 3 the number of hrv species. for the sake of simplicity, the study proposes to consider this virus as a member of the hrv-c clade. these findings provide new insight into the genomic diversity and ability of r"

pmc6130466,"the structure of the hcov-229e fusion core reveals a 24-turn hr1 helix, which is the longest observed so far in published hcov fusion core structures. this finding highlights the importance of developing vaccines or treatments for covs, as the melting temperatures  t m  of α-hcovs, including hcov-229e and hcov-nl63, are significantly and consistently higher than those of β-hcovs, presumably owing to a larger buried interface and a higher affinity between the longer hr2s and 3hr1 cores of α-hcovs. the structure of the hcov-229e fusion core also indicates that the high-affinity interaction between hr1 and hr2 of hcov-229e is mediated by both extensive hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. this finding suggests that a good pan-cov inhibitory peptide mimic of hr2 would preserve all of the conserved hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between hr1 and hr2 of all hcovs and also accommodate the variation among different hcovs. the structure of the hcov-229e fusion core shows that the electrostatic surface potentials of 3hr1 cores are opposite in α-hcovs and β-hcovs at some positions. this finding implies that residues on the hr2 inhibitory peptide mimic should be carefully chosen such that they could form contacts, but not electrostatic or steric clashes, with surrounding residues on the 3hr1 cores of different hcovs. the structure of the hcov-229e fusion core indicates that the hydrophobic packing of their 3hr1 cores is similar to each other overall, despite differences in the electrostatic surface potential of 3hr1 cores across different hcovs. this finding reveals substantial differences in the electrostatic surface potential of 3hr1 cores between α-hcovs and β-hcovs at certain positions, at which residues on the hr2 inhibitory peptide mimic should also be chosen such that they could form contacts, but not electrostatic or steric clashes, with surrounding residues on the 3hr1 cores of different"

pmc3290960,"diagnosis of chikungunya virus  chikv  infection was confirmed in four patients through positive reverse transcription  rt -pcr results, viral loads, and isolation of the virus from acute-phase sera in 2006. the outbreak was associated with the indian ocean region, and a new variant was identified through mutations in the e1 gene. the viral loads were high, up to 3.3 x 109 copies/ml, and severe arthralgia and tenosynovitis with pain on pressure were observed. late-to-chronic chikv rheumatic manifestations were also reported. the variant identified in the indian ocean region was genetically heterogeneous compared to strains in the east/central africa lineage, with specific amino acid mutations in the e1 gene. the variant emerged recently and dispersed in the region, leading to an epidemic pattern. chikv infection was transmitted through direct contact with highly viremic blood, potentially without the need for an animal reservoir, in accordance with the ecologic cycle of the virus and its vector in the region, which is similar to that seen in dengue fever. the diagnosis of chikv infection in a healthcare worker was associated with contact with the blood of a patient returning from the region during the outbreak, although the vector did not generally bite in southern france during winter. the quantification of viral loads through rna, which encompasses the target region, provided a good reflection of biologic reality, although in the absence of published data, high viral loads were uncommon in arthropodborne viral diseases such as dengue fever and west nile virus infection. high viremia was observed, which enabled virus isolation from all viremic patients."

pmc3545344,"at pet markets, direct and indirect contact with animals and related surfaces are widespread and pose a significant and major public health concern, as all animals, their containers, seller facilities, and sellers themselves are considered sources of potential contamination. the majority of observed visitors to vendors make indirect contact with animals through touching housing, tables, sellers, money, and other merchandise associated with vendors or animals. the proportion of visitors to vendors making subsequent modes of contact, such as hand to head  hand to mouth , hand to body  hand to body , and hand to another person, is broadly consistent between pet markets. person-to-person contamination is likely to rapidly increase its representation as presumed contaminated attendees move around the venue and readily form incidental contacts with a large number of people. the established nature of amphibians and reptiles as a reservoir of potentially pathogenic zoonotic agents implies that all animals, their containers, seller facilities, and sellers themselves must be regarded as sources of potential contamination. hand sanitizer products used do not offer comprehensive protection from infection, and their promotion may encourage misplaced public confidence in an unreliable method. contamination of clothes and hair represents a robust contamination source that persists even after leaving the pet market, regardless of hand cleansing. hand sanitizer products used were infrequently adopted at the visited events, and when present, were utilized in a less than thorough manner. the situating of pet markets in venues often used for general public purposes, such as school halls and leisure centres, constitutes a potential public health hazard that realistically may endure for days, weeks, or months following the conclusion of the pet market. the persistence of bacterial contamination on surfaces in the general environment, including door handles, floors, doorways, walls, light switches, and many others, constitutes a potential ongoing public health hazard. even non-attendance at a pet market does not guarantee that public health is not compromised, as these same venues may be sequentially used for a wide variety of other public purposes, including schooling of children, carrying with them a host of pathogens and the potential to spread disease far beyond the source"

pmc5322954,"this study is the first to compare adenoid and middle ear microbiota in both ome children and healthy controls using a sensitive method to detect a comprehensive panel of respiratory viruses and bacteria. the detection rate of bacteria in the middle ear was significantly higher in patients with ome than in controls, while the higher overall frequency of bacteria detection in mews from ome patients was expected due to the accumulation of middle ear effusion suctioning microbial components of the nasopharyngeal microbiota. the detection of adenovirus was more frequent in hypertrophic adenoid tissues from patients with ome than in normal adenoids from healthy controls, but it is not clear whether adenovirus has any role in pathogenesis of adenoid hypertrophy. simultaneous detection of hadv and s. pneumoniae in adenoid tissue could be acting in concert to modify the course of ome due to interactions between viruses and bacteria on different mucosal surfaces, including the upper respiratory tract mucosa and tonsils. the findings suggest that microbial correlations already described in acute middle ear disease could play a role in such chronic processes, and the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the middle ear of patients undergoing cochlear implant is independent of biofilm formation. this study adds evidence that microbial community present in the middle ear may be associated with persistence of fluid and pathogenesis of ome due to higher detection rates of potentially pathogenic bacteria, but not respiratory viruses, by real-time pcr in middle ear samples as compared to control patients without adenoid hypertrophy. the study did not observe correlation between the microbiota of adenoid and middle ear, neither in ome children nor in controls. the findings suggest that microbial community present in the middle ear may be associated with persistence of fluid and pathogenesis of ome due to the observed association of detection of hadv and s. pneumoniae in adenoid tissues from patients with ome, which could be acting in concert to modify the course of ome due to interactions between viruses and bacteria on different mucosal surfaces, including the upper respiratory tract m"

pmc4110237,"in the study by jørgensen et al., four herds with persistent diarrhoea in neonatal piglets were selected based on certain criteria, including a history of neonatal diarrhoea for at least one year, vaccination against escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens type c, failure of preventive antibiotic medication of sows, and negative results of routine diagnostic examination for enteritis in five piglets. the study by jørgensen et al. suggested that neither clostridium perfringens type a, clostridium difficile, strongyloides ransomi, giardia spp, nor cryptosporidium spp was involved in the diarrhoeal outbreaks. in the study by jørgensen et al., gross-pathological findings in affected piglets were characterized by flaccidity of intestines with no mucosal lesions and milk-filled stomachs. in the study by jørgensen et al., the presence of hollow flanks, protruding ribs, fore-knee abrasions, and dehydration was too low prevalent to be included in the statistical models due to problems with complete separation, caused by sparse data. in the study by jørgensen et al., population average odds ratios  orpa  were calculated using the following formula  orpa = exp βss / sqrt 1 + 0.346 * δ2litter where βss is the subject-specific regression coefficient and δ2litter is the litter variance. the population averaged, rather than cluster-specific estimates of ors, were used since the study aimed at drawing general rather than litter-specific conclusions."
pmc114066,"ebola virus gp can be cleaved by proteases other than furin, as evidenced by the detection of gp2 in virions with mutant gps lacking the furin recognition site. the extent of ebola virus gp cleavage by furin does not correlate with viral infectivity, as observed in two different pseudotype systems. ebola virus gp is posttranslationally acylated with palmitic acids at the cys670 and cys672 residues in the transmembrane anchor region of the molecule, and both of these cysteine residues are acylated. endothelial cells and hepatocytes are not necessarily the preferred targets of ebola virus gp, as evidenced by the lower infectivities of these cells compared to human kidney epithelial cells. antiserum to ebola virus gp/sgp can neutralize the infectivity of a murine retrovirus pseudotyped with the zaire gp, indicating the presence of subtype-specific neutralizing epitopes on ebola virus gp molecules, and the neutralizing activity can be markedly reduced in the presence of zaire sgp, suggesting that gp and sgp share neutralizing epitopes."
pmc2204037,"analysis of 495 near full-length hiv-1 group m sequences reveals that only 5.2% of possible 21-mers are >50% conserved, with highly conserved regions including regulatory domains and essential sequences for viral replication. targeting these highly conserved regions with antiviral sirnas overwhelms sequence diversity and reduces chances of viral mutational escape. a total of 216 highly conserved targets were identified, with 31 predicted functional by guidelines for sirna selection. validation of 41 sirnas against four hiv-1 strains revealed that 26 of them effectively inhibited viral replication by >80%, with some viral strains exhibiting nucleotide substitutions in target sites that abolished inhibition. highly effective sirnas with maximal conservation identified include si521  poly a site, 94% conservation , si764/770  ψ, 88% , si510  tar/poly a, 84% , si2075  ribosomal slip site, 70% , and si4750/4751/4753  integrase region, 71-74% . these regions are found mostly in the 5' ltr, protease, and integrase."
pmc523257,"dc-sign and dc-signr enhance filovirus and sars-cov infection through lectin engagement, with marv gp and s-bearing pseudotypes showing 35-65 and 30-fold increases in infectious entry, respectively. engagement of dc-sign by sars-cov s glycoprotein is specifically blocked by the carbohydrate mannan, indicating that dc-sign facilitates sars-cov transmission to susceptible cells. dc-sign and dc-signr do not function as receptors for sars-cov, but they can promote sars-cov infection of already-permissive cells. dc-sign-expressing dendritic cells  dcs  are not permissive to sars-cov infection but can transmit sars-cov to susceptible cells, and only 50% of dc-mediated viral transfer is inhibited by mannan, suggesting that factors other than dc-sign or related lectins contribute to transmission. dc-sign-expressing alveolar macrophages could capture and transmit virus to susceptible cells, such as type ii pneumocytes, which might promote local infection during sars-cov infection."
pmc5242487,"the experiment demonstrated the spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  pedv  to nearly all feed- and non-feed-contact surfaces in a feed manufacturing facility, with viral contamination particularly challenging to decontaminate, even with the aid of wet sanitizers and heat. the study found that plastic and rubber surfaces were less conducive to pedv contamination compared to concrete and metal surfaces, likely due to their smoother attributes. the experiment showed that equipment surfaces, due to direct contact with contaminated feed, had greater contamination compared to structural surfaces, which were less conducive to contamination but still showed significant contamination. dust generated during processing of contaminated feed was found to lead to contamination of previously uncontaminated surfaces, emphasizing the important role dust particles may play in the spread of biological hazards throughout a feed manufacturing facility. the study highlights the need for feed mill operators to be particularly judicious regarding use of good manufacturing practices and biosecurity protocols to exclude pedv from entry into the feed mill, as the virus was spread to nearly all feed- and non-feed-contact surfaces and was particularly challenging to decontaminate, even with the aid of wet sanitizers and heat. additional research is necessary to understand the role of dust in animal food biological hazard transmission and to formulate practical feed mill sanitation recommendations to prevent and reduce pedv contamination of equipment and facilities."
pmc6797241,"in a pediatric stem cell transplant population, universal use of surgical masks by healthcare providers was associated with a greater than 50% reduction in nosocomial respiratory virus  rv  infection. in a rehabilitation setting, earlier initiation of transmission-based precautions for symptomatic patients, discouraging visitation by people with potentially infectious symptoms, and making it easier for staff to stay home when sick, significantly reduced the number of bed closure days due to rv outbreaks. in a pediatric population, nosocomial transmission of rvs was prevented through increased viral testing, but continued sporadic nosocomial transmission of rvs was observed despite improvement in infection prevention and control practices. in a pediatric population, limiting visits by children under the age of 12 during the winter months may reduce nosocomial transmission of viral respiratory infection. in the rehabilitation setting, despite the reduction in symptomatic visitation, either healthcare providers or visitors could have continued to transmit rvs through asymptomatic viral carriage."
pmc6721277,"spatio-temporal analysis of eight infectious diseases in china from 2006 to 2016 revealed a distinct increasing trend for hand-foot-mouth disease  hfmd  and hepatitis e, while decreasing trends for tap, dysentery, and hepatitis a were observed. the incidence of oiid remained steady, and summer was the season with the greatest number of cases of different infectious diseases. the spatio-temporal distribution of infectious diseases was unevenly distributed throughout china, with high-risk areas for hfmd and oiid located in the beijing-tianjin-tangshan region and south china. high-risk areas for tap were found in some parts of southwest china, while higher incidence rates for dysentery and hepatitis a were observed in the beijing-tianjin-tangshan region and some western provincial units. high-risk areas for hepatitis e were found in the beijing-tianjin-tangshan region and the yangtze river delta area. the study suggests that the authorities should pay more attention to class c diseases and hepatitis e, as the incidence rate of hepatitis e surpassed hepatitis a. disease-specific, location-specific, and disease-combined interventions should be established, regardless of the various distribution patterns of infectious diseases."
pmc2270820,"the study identified a contemporary human parechovirus type 1  hpev1  strain through vidisca virus discovery cdna amplification fragment length polymorphism analysis. phylogenetic analysis and recombination analysis revealed evidence of recombination between type 3 nonstructural protein genes and type 1 structural protein genes in the identified hpev1 strain. the study found that the non-structural protein genes of the identified hpev1 strain and of prototype hpev3 strains are not co-segregating, which highlights the lack of knowledge on the genesis and ecology of human parechoviruses. the study confirmed that the 5'-noncoding region of the identified hpev1 strain has likely been acquired from an hpev4 strain. the study identified a breakpoint at the border between structural and nonstructural genes in the identified hpev1 strain, suggesting a potential recombination event between type 3 nonstructural protein genes and type 1 structural protein genes."

pmc2928320,"tumv-induced vesicles are dynamic structures with irregular shapes and sizes ranging from 0.6 to 4.3 μm in diameter. some are highly motile with unidirectional movement and stop-and-go activity. vesicles co-align with microfilaments and require active transport due to high cytoplasmic viscosity. inhibition of microfilament polymerization with latrunculin b stops vesicle movement and significantly decreases virus production. viral proteins are imported into the factories, with translation assumed to occur in the cytoplasm and proteins exported randomly to vesicles. however, translation instead occurs within the factories or is tightly associated with them, as many translation factors have been found within the tumv-induced vesicles. a cis mechanism incorporates proteins synthesized from a single viral genome into each vesicle, indicating that translation and replication occur within tumv-induced vesicles. this is supported by the co-localization of viral double-stranded rna and host translation factors. viral replication and translation are coupled within tumv-induced vesicles, with viral proteins accumulating in patches on the outer endoplasmic reticulum  er  membrane, initiating membrane curvature. a switch then happens from translation to replication, allowing for viral rna synthesis within the same vesicles. clusters of large vesicles are produced during a second budding from the er."

pmc2857234,"a study analyzing data from the u.s. fish and wildlife service found that 78 mammal genera imported into the united states are capable of carrying rabies viruses, making it the zoonosis with the greatest number of affected genera. the study also identified 57 mammal genera imported into the u.s. that are capable of carrying bacillus anthracis, the bacterium that causes anthrax. mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which includes strains of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, was found to be capable of infecting 48 mammal genera imported into the u.s. the study revealed that the greatest number of affected genera for any risk zoonosis was found for canis  dogs  and felis  cats , both with 14 affected genera each. the study also highlighted the broad nature of risk associated with importing wild animals, as many opportunities exist for key zoonotic pathogens to be imported into the u.s., and the risks associated with importations of wild animals in general go beyond quantifying the prevalence of the various pathogens in each wildlife host, as determining this prevalence is beyond the scope of the analysis."
pmc4480394,"the first identified case of middle east respiratory syndrome  mers  in the united states did not result in transmission to any of the 61 identified contacts, despite the fact that some contacts had face-to-face interactions and prolonged exposure to the case-patient. the absence of transmission to household and community contacts may be due to the case-patient's mild initial respiratory symptoms, self-isolation at home, and lack of need for caregiving assistance before hospital admission. the absence of transmission to healthcare personnel  hcp  contacts may be due to the lack of high-risk procedures, short duration of exposure, and the few hcp contacts with underlying medical conditions. the accuracy of recalled time versus actual time spent with the case-patient may be less reliable for hcp contacts who see the patient regularly for short periods of time. the use of gps-based tracer tags to monitor hcp interaction with the case-patient may not always result in accurate data because hcp may not have been wearing their assigned tag when entering the room, or may have stood close to but not in the room, causing the tracking system to record incorrectly."
pmc4481577,"in a systematic review of 30 studies on influenza pandemic preparedness, it was found that only 4% of studies addressed all three components of pandemic preparedness  mitigation, containment, and suppression. this highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to pandemic preparedness. a study on the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic found that social distancing measures, such as school closures and workplace closures, reduced the effective reproduction number  r  by 40-50%. a modeling study on the 2014 ebola outbreak in west africa found that a combination of early case detection, contact tracing, and quarantine measures could have prevented up to 70% of cases. a review of the use of compartmental models in pandemic preparedness and response found that such models can provide useful insights into the dynamics of epidemics and the impact of interventions, but they should be used in conjunction with other sources of information, such as laboratory studies and epidemiological data. a study on the use of individual-based models in pandemic preparedness and response found that such models can provide more detailed and nuanced insights into the spread of disease and the impact of interventions, but they are computationally intensive and require large amounts of data. a review of the use of phylogenetic methods in pandemic preparedness and response found that such methods can provide insights into the evolutionary history of pathogens and the transmission dynamics of epidemics, but they require specialized expertise in molecular biology and evolutionary theory. a study on the use of agent-based models in pandemic preparedness and response found that such models can provide insights into the complex and dynamic interactions between individuals and the impact of interventions in real-world settings, but they require large amounts of data and are computationally intensive. a review of the use of network-based models in pandemic preparedness and response found that such models can provide insights into the transmission dynamics of epidemics and the impact of network structure on disease spread, but they require specialized expertise in network theory and graphical algorithms. a modeling study on the use of machine learning algorithms in pandemic preparedness and response found that such algorithms can provide insights into the prediction of epidemic outcomes"
pmc6154615,"in the section discussing the use of gold nanoparticles in vaccines, the authors report that gold nanoparticles can be used as adjuvants to enhance the immune response to vaccine antigens. this can increase the antibody response, improve the stability of the antigens, and provide better protection against infectious diseases such as influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, and malaria. gold nanoparticles can also be used to deliver antigens to specific cells, such as dendritic cells in lymph nodes, for the design of vaccines against diseases such as malaria and listeriosis. the authors also mention that gold nanoparticles can be functionalized with surface ligands, such as polysaccharides or lipopolysaccharides, to target specific cells or tissues for vaccine delivery. this can improve the targeting specificity and reduce the potential for adverse side effects. the authors highlight that gold nanoparticles can be used to deliver antigens to intracellular sites, such as the cytoplasm, for the design of vaccines against intracellular pathogens such as mycobacterium tuberculosis. the authors also discuss the potential use of gold nanoparticles in the development of vaccines against viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus, where they can be conjugated to viral surface proteins to block viral replication and virus-induced cytopathogenic effects. the authors note that the use of gold nanoparticles in vaccines can also enhance the stability and bioavailability of vaccine antigens, which can improve the overall effectiveness of the vaccines. however, they also caution that the use of gold nanoparticles carries added costs, and the logistics systems for vaccine distribution need to be strengthened and optimized as newer and more expensive vaccines are introduced and attempted to reach people of different ages and in new settings."

pmc3228450,"the study analyzed 1,266 h3-ha sequences from seven geographic regions, including hong kong, with temporally overlapping influenza epidemics, to understand the global circulation of influenza a virus. the study used a nonreversible continuous-time markov-chain model to estimate viral migration through discrete geographic regions and the general patterns of global circulation of influenza a virus. the study found no evidence for viral reassortment, a potential confounder, in the analyses. the study assumed there was seasonality in southeast asia and hong kong to discriminate between migration events corresponding to and from the northern and southern epidemic seasons and to assess persistence of viral populations in southeast asia and hong kong. the study found statistical supports for viral migration, with bf > 100 indicating decisive support, whereas 6 ≤ bf ≤ 10, 10 ≤ bf ≤ 30, and 30 ≤ bf ≤ 100 indicating substantial, strong, and very strong statistical support, respectively."
pmc5712444,"in a study of children hospitalized for respiratory syncytial virus  rsv -associated lower respiratory tract infection  lrti  in south africa, the authors found that rsv coinfection with any other respiratory virus was not associated with more severe disease. the study also identified an association between rsv-adenovirus  adv  coinfection and life-threatening disease in hospitalized children less than 5 years of age, suggesting that enhanced adv disease may be driving more severe disease in children with rsv-adv coinfection. the study found that viral load, as measured by cycle threshold  ct  values, was not associated with disease severity in either rsv-positive children or rsv-adv coinfection. the study noted that the prevalence of non-rsv respiratory viruses was lower in children hospitalized for viral respiratory illnesses during the rsv season, which could be indicative of viral interference in which the presence of rsv in the community inhibits infection by or circulation of other viruses. the study highlighted the need for further exploration of the clinical relevance of some of the identified viruses, as well as the need to better characterize viral coinfections within this population, given the limitations of the multiplex polymerase chain reaction  pcr  used and the cross-reactivity between some viruses."
pmc5029213,"the study identified a novel variant of the deformed wing virus  dwv  in honeybees, which they named type c. this variant is distinct from the previously known variants, type a and b, and it forms a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree. the analysis suggests that type c has not recently emerged but rather is an established dwv variant. this finding is supported by the presence of type c in honeybees from hawaii, which have not been colonized by the parasitic mite varroa. the study also confirmed the observation made in other bee species that dwv is a ""generalist"" virus that can infect different insects. however, it remains unclear whether type c causes acute wing deformities in honeybees or if its presence is because of viral ""spillover"" from another host. the study found that dwv exists as a swarm of recombining variants and occupies large amounts of sequence space, which may be one of the factors contributing to its capability to maintain a persistent infection. defining dwv as a quasispecies with at least three master variants that can recombine with each other would be a more progressive classification of the dwv quasispecies. the study also suggests that dwv is able to replicate in honeybees, as the large number of dwv type c and a-c recombinant reads in the samples indicate. further direct manipulation experiments, such as those carried out by ryabov et al.  2014 , could be crucial in determining whether the novel type c genome and any of its recombinants are hypervirulent."
pmc2844401,"the study found that 44% of participants had low knowledge about swine flu, with only 5% having high level of knowledge. the majority of participants  54%  agreed that the government should isolate patients with swine flu in special hospitals, avoid inviting workers from areas where the disease is prevalent, restrict travel to and from such areas, and be ready to close schools if the number of cases increases dramatically. the study revealed a high level of concern, with 54% of participants reporting high concern, although it did not translate into a higher compliance with precautionary measures. education was found to be the only significant predictor of concern, with the level of education being inversely related to the level of concern. the study found that hand washing and the use of face masks in crowded areas were the reported measures by more than a half of the participants, while other measures, such as isolation and wearing of a surgical mask or an n95 mask, were less frequently reported. the study found that misconceptions about the disease may be related to the use of television and newspapers as the primary sources of information on swine flu. the study found that physicians and health educators seem to play an insufficient role in the education of the public. the study found that regional differences in anxiety towards swine flu have been suggested. the study found that culture and individual anxiety are important predictors of behavioral responses to pandemic influenza."

pmc6789852,"soluble forms of viral envelope proteins can divert fc-mediated effector functions away from infected cells by occupying neutralizing antibodies or by competing for antibody binding sites, as observed in several viruses, including rsv, hiv-1, and ebov. endocytosis of viral envelope proteins, either spontaneously or induced by antibody binding, can reduce fc-mediated effector functions, including adcc, adcml, and phagocytosis, as observed in hiv-1, herpesviruses, and pseudorabies virus. the internalization of antibody-bound viral envelope proteins in an epitope-specific conformation-dependent manner can enhance the efficiency of fc-mediated effector functions, as observed in hiv-1. the combination of antibodies targeting different non-overlapping epitopes against viral infections, including hiv-1, chikungunya virus, and influenza a virus, can improve antibody therapeutic activity by limiting viral resistance and extending their therapeutic effect. the modification of antibody glycosylation in fc-mediated effector functions, such as the presence or absence of fucose and sialic acid, can significantly impact their efficacy against virally infected cells, as observed in hiv-1, rsv, and dengue virus."

pmc5443424,"this study identified a hospital-associated outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus  mers-cov  in daejeon, south korea, affecting 14 patients, with a case fatality rate of 44%. the outbreak occurred in two hospitals and was associated with a single index case-patient in a hospital in daejeon. the estimated median incubation period was similar to that observed in previous outbreaks in the eastern province of saudi arabia in 2013 and jeddah, saudi arabia, in 2014. the attack rate among caregivers was higher in hospital a than in hospital b, as caregivers in hospital a, who cared for mostly bedridden immobile patients, were required to be in prolonged close contact with patients, increasing the probability of mers-cov transmission. in hospital b, the attack rate among caregivers was lower, possibly due to the presence of more severely ill patients. the authors identified several cases with uncommon routes of transmission, such as a nurse in the intensive care unit who performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation while wearing a level d protector, potentially exposing herself to mers-cov, and an employee who worked in information technology and was employed by hospital a during january–may 30, 2015, potentially infected by fomites in an elevator or exposed to a patient in a place lacking closed-circuit television coverage. the authors developed a unique and successful cohort quarantine policy to prevent the spread of mers-cov to the local community. however, the policy raised ethical issues associated with close contact of susceptible persons with potentially infected persons, as some medical staff and caregivers may have been contaminated with mers-cov after visiting room 1007, potentially exposing them to a patient in room 1013. the authors noted that the characteristics of specific hospitals affected attack rates and case fatality rates. hospital b, which is a university hospital and contains more severely ill patients than hospital a, had a higher case fatality rate than hospital a. additionally, because immobile patients require personal caregiving, their caregivers were required to be in prolonged close contact with patients, increasing the probability of mers-cov transmission."
pmc4342244,"vlps, when injected post-exposure, significantly accelerate the onset of isg induction in ebola-infected mice, allowing for timely establishment of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory states. vlps trigger early induction of negative regulatory isgs, which limits excess inflammatory responses and allows for maturation of antigen presentation function, resulting in robust adaptive immune responses. vlps provide post-exposure protection against ebola infection by relieving ebola's antagonism against type i interferons, resulting in reduced systemic inflammation and subsequent enhancement in acquired immune responses. the transcription factor irf8 is required for vlp-mediated post-exposure protection against ebola infection, as it amplifies type i interferon gene induction and boosts interferon biological activities. vlps augment type i interferon-responsive genes via irf8-dependent manner in ebola-infected mice, leading to reduced viral replication and inflammatory gene expression."

pmc5069461,"this microarray analysis profiled global lncrnas and mrnas in both active and latent hiv infection, revealing a quantitative pattern of modulations between the two infection stages. the study found that many of the differentially expressed lncrnas and mrnas were specifically modulated during active or latent infection, suggesting a high degree of lncrna involvement in epigenetic modifications and subsequent transcriptional control. the study also found that many of the modulated lncrnas and mrnas were distributed on both ""+"" and ""-"" strands of different chromosomes and belonged to all groups  intergenic, intron sense-overlapping, exon-sense overlapping, natural antisense, intronic antisense, and bidirectional. this knowledge can help determine lncrnas associated host factors responsible for guiding epigenetic remodeling and subsequent transcriptional control. the study found that many of the differentially expressed lncrnas and mrnas were involved in 155 biological cycles, with the majority belonging to immunological and inflammatory significance. this was expected because most infection, including that by hiv, induces immunological and inflammatory defense signaling. the study also found that enrichment of replication-associated pathways  such as rna transport pathway, nucleotide excision pathway, spliceosome pathway, and pyrimidine metabolism, etc.  during latent infection suggests a highly sophisticated and regressive epigenetics overhauling in comparison to active infection. the study suggests that disrupted expression of even a single coding or non-coding gene possesses the ability to affect multiple molecular pathways, and different pathological phenotypes may entangle in converged molecular circuits. thus, the discovery of multiple epigenetic signatures can accelerate studies on their pathophysiologic mechanisms and lead to disease-modifying therapy."

pmc4305179,"the present study found that cerebral expression of the non-glutamic acid-leucine-arginine chemokine cxcl9 increases in an ifn-γ–dependent manner during reactivation of t. gondii infection, and that cxcl9 is crucial for recruiting immune cells into the brain and preventing tachyzoite growth and reactivation of cerebral infection with t. gondii. cxcl9 is one of the three major chemokines expressed in the brains of chronically infected wild-type balb/c mice, and it is the most highly expressed among these three chemokines in their brains during cerebral infection with t. gondii. the present study revealed that ifn-γ regulates t-cell infiltration into the brain by inducing an expression of both the adhesion molecule vcam-1 and the chemokine cxcl9 critical for the t-cell migration into the brain to prevent tachyzoite growth and reactivation of cerebral infection with t. gondii. the present study found that cxcl9 is important for mediating t-cell recruitment to the areas where tachyzoites begin proliferating to prevent reactivation of cerebral infection with t. gondii, and that cxcl9 plays a crucial role in host defense against infection with multiple types of intracellular microorganisms in the brain. in contrast to the observations in the present study on the importance of cxcl9 for host resistance against reactivation of cerebral infection with t. gondii, it was reported that there is no significant differences in mortality between cxcl9-deficient and wild-type c57bl/6 mice during acute primary infection with t. gondii, and that the role of cxcl9 in resistance to the parasite differs, depending on the stages of infection and likely depending on the organs."
pmc4207789,"the aids epidemic in brazil follows a logistic-type growth of total aids cases per year, with an exponential regime in the first few years of the aids spreading. this pattern suggests a competition of increasing and establishing agents, typically associated with a new infection in a confined area. the parameter obtained from this analysis is in good agreement with the growth of aids in some european countries. the growth in the absolute frequency of aids cases in brazil is decreasing with time, consistent with the literature. the fluctuations after ca. 1992 occur because it is the region where the small time scale is already broken  ca. 10 years for aids . the infection in brazil is running to a plateau, and assuming that this behavior is mainly due to the results of the programs and strategies against the aids infection, the first results of these efforts occurred mainly in urban centers with an average of more than 10 aids cases per year. the distribution of the aids epidemic in brazil in small spatial scales  over cities  follows a super-linear allometric pattern, with an exponent typically around 1.9. this pattern is consistent with the literature and predicts that the infection over cities scales with the population in that region. the infection in brazil is expected to lose its strength in the largest urban centers, where the average of more than 84 aids cases per year, because the fluctuations of cases appear to be smaller. new aids cases in brazil are still growing in cities of the groups i and ii, which have an average of less than 10 aids cases per year. the average number of new infections per year  as well as their fluctuations  in these cities merit further attention from the brazilian health authorities. however, the first results of the efforts against the infection occurred mainly in urban centers with an average of more than 10 aids cases per year."

pmc6738215,"sp-a and sp-d, two innate immune defence proteins produced by the lung, have been shown to play a key role in the clearance of viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus  hiv , hepatitis c virus  hcv , severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  virus, and influenza virus. both sp-a and sp-d have been shown to be essential for maintaining a non-inflamed environment within the lungs by balancing the immune system, avoiding excessive inflammation or autoimmune responses. the trimeric structure of sp-a and sp-d allows for their broad selectivity, allowing them to recognise and competitively bind structurally similar trimeric viral fusion proteins, preventing their attachment to the host cell and neutralising the virus while enhancing its clearance from the body. the dual function of these collectins could be of particular advantage when considering therapeutics for inflammatory lung diseases, such as severe asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, where there is a deficiency in the level of sp-d in the lungs. sp-a and sp-d are innate immune defence proteins that are structurally similar to the viral fusion proteins that they selectively bind, and have the potential to be exploited for the development of novel, anti-infective, and immune-modulatory therapeutics."

pmc3573272,"viral proteins can disrupt every step of the type i interferon response, from virus entry to antiviral gene expression and function. some viruses, such as the human cytomegalovirus  hcmv , directly induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes  isgs  to their advantage, while others, such as rotavirus, exploit the negative feedback loop of the interferon response to promote viral replication. viruses can target specific isgs, such as the immediate-early 1  ie1  protein of human cytomegalovirus  hcmv , which down-regulates isg16 expression, or the 76000 molecular weight mxa isg, which associates with virion components and nuclear viral replication compartments to enhance virus replication. the viral protein vm25 of human cytomegalovirus  hcmv  re-localizes the isg viperin to mitochondria, where it disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and enhances viral infection. rotavirus infection of intestinal epithelial cells leads to a strong induction of the type i interferon response, but instead of limiting virus growth, ifn signaling promotes rotavirus replication, particularly at the early stages. the proposed mechanism is that type i ifn increases pkr levels, which the virus somehow exploits for its own replication."
pmc6346480,"a study in brazil detected influenza a h18n11  virus in two artibeus lituratus bats in 2012, with close genetic relatedness to a strain found in peru in 2010. the low detection rate of 0.4% in this study is not consistent with previous studies and may suggest seasonal variation in bat influenza virus infections. high concentrations of the virus in intestinal specimens suggest intestinal tropism and potential fecal shedding into the environment. the viral genome sequences showed high sequence identity between the brazil and peru strains, with amino acid exchanges in polymerase basic 1 and nucleoprotein genes. thermodynamic modeling revealed preservation of critical amino acid residues associated with influenza a virus replication and entry, with no amino acid exchanges in the putative receptor binding site or active site of the viral glycoproteins. this suggests broadly conserved cellular receptor and biologic activity in different bat species. significantly fewer amino acid exchanges were observed between the ha  hemagglutinin  proteins of bat influenza a virus variants than between the respective nl  neuraminidase-like  proteins. this finding may suggest comparable evolutionary dynamics between chiropteran and avian reservoirs. the distribution of artibeus lituratus and artibeus planirostris bats, in which h18n11 was originally detected in peru, overlaps, potentially facilitating virus exchange across the populations. phylogenetic analyses confirmed close genetic relationship between peru and brazil h18n11 variants across all eight segments, suggesting lack of reassortment events."

pmc2864512,"the use of ligand-conjugated liposomes, specifically those targeting tumor blood vessels, can significantly improve the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy by selectively delivering drugs to tumor tissues while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. peptide ligands, which are smaller, less immunogenic, and easier to produce and manipulate than antibodies, can improve tumor penetration and decrease clearance by macrophages, resulting in more effective drug delivery. passive pegylated liposomes, while effective, can result in increased toxicity due to normal organ uptake and accumulation of the encapsulated drug in mononuclear phagocytic system cells in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. phage display can be used to selectively bind peptide ligands to tumor-associated antigens and facilitate the delivery of drug-containing liposomes to intended cellular sites, resulting in more selective anticancer activity. the use of peptide-conjugated liposomes to target tumor blood vessels allows for the destruction of both tumor blood vessels and tumor cells, resulting in a greater, more durable anticancer effect than is found with simple antiangiogenic therapy."

pmc3825547,"aging is associated with structural changes in the lungs, including a reduction in total lung capacity, decreased lung compliance, and altered lung elasticity, which place elderly patients at risk for poor airway clearance and increased morbidity and mortality. inflamm-aging, the basal activation of the innate immune system in aged individuals in the absence of an immunologic threat, contributes to reduced elasticity and destruction of the delicate lung parenchyma with advanced age. the imbalance of immune mediators, delayed immune activation, and protracted course of inflammation associated with aging may result in increased morbidity and mortality in aging individuals following infection, environmental exposures, or systemic injury. aging is associated with changes in the innate and adaptive immune systems, including altered expression and downstream signaling of toll-like receptors and reduced cytotoxicity and neutrophil recruitment, which compromise host defenses with age. copd, the third leading cause of death worldwide, is prevalent in the elderly population, and careful consideration regarding treatment recommendations must be made in regard to treatment in this fragile population due to the many age-associated changes in the respiratory and pulmonary system."
pmc2613625,"rig-i, a key protein in the innate immune response, can bind and respond to both single-stranded and double-stranded rna molecules, with the latter requiring a helicase domain for activation. the antagonist 2006, a modified single-stranded rna molecule, can inhibit rig-i signaling and interfere with ligand binding by both the helicase and regulatory domains of rig-i, possibly through interactions with the atpase motif. lgp2, a related rna helicase, strongly prefers binding to double-stranded rna molecules and binds them with cooperativity. differential scanning fluorometry, a method for measuring protein unfolding, reveals that the rig-i dimer complexed with double-stranded rna is a more stable structure than the complex with the antagonist 2006. reconstruction of rig-i with ligand suggests that the rig-i dimer complexed with double-stranded rna has more extensive surface interactions than the more open complex with antagonist 2006, possibly accounting for differences in thermal denaturation. rig-i conformational changes and signaling suggest that proper design and engineering of single-stranded rna molecules will be needed to regulate signaling by a specific innate immune pathway. the multitude of responses from rig-i is complex and likely reflects different rig-i monomer and oligomer conformations that could lead to different signaling responses. the 2006 dimer complex contains four distinct sets of contacts, suggesting that interactions of the antagonists induce additional interactions. changes in the oligomer structures of innate immune receptors, including rig-i and toll-like receptor 3, will hold the key to downstream signaling. the resolution of the reconstruction prevents firm assignment of domains, but several features could help reduce the possibilities."

pmc549431,"the authors identified a significant number of sequence tracts with low hybridization specificity in the atm gene, particularly in regions containing homopolymeric stretches. these tracts can form substantial secondary structures, which can artificially lower the affinity of target to probe and thus lower the hybridization specificity. the authors found that single base substitution probes showed the lowest inter-sample coefficient of variation across samples, whereas one and two base deletion probes showed higher coefficients of variation than substitution probes. the authors suggest that substantially more control hybridization experiments may be needed to determine baseline fluctuations in the hybridization specificities of insertion and deletion probes relative to those of substitution probes. the authors noted that duplexes containing two base bulges are generally less stable than those containing a single base mismatch, due to the assumption that helical stacking is interrupted by bulges of two or greater bases in length while it is preserved for one base bulge. the authors suggest that it is important to consider error rates when assigning the identity of a mutation based on mismatch probe data, especially when dealing with clinical samples, as confirming the identity of specific sequence variants by sequencing is critical to precisely determine the nature of a sequence change within a given sample, even when dealing with slightly ambiguous hybridization data. the authors noted that the single base substitution probes showed lower inter- and intra-sample variability than one base deletion, two base deletion, and one base insertion probes, in agreement with their findings on duplexes containing single base bulges and mismatches."
pmc3816197,"in the context of emerging infectious diseases, rapid collection of epidemiological data is crucial from the onset of the event. traditional methods of constructing questionnaires for each event result in delayed epidemiological responses that impede understanding and control of the event. the software tool ""epibasket"" addresses this issue by adapting e-commerce concepts to enable rapid collection of standardized data after an outbreak or environmental disaster. it enables epidemiologists to choose appropriate questions from a catalogue based on relevant variables identified through a literature review. the software facilitates better standardization of questionnaires by assigning a ""value"" to each question based on its use in published papers, with a higher value assigned to questions published in high-profile journals. in the context of knowledge, attitudes, and practices  kap  surveys, which are frequently explored during or after outbreaks or environmental disasters, epibasket provides a proof-of-concept prototype. it enables epidemiologists to tailor questionnaires by choosing appropriate questions from a catalogue and provides online questionnaires and ready-to-use forms. the software facilitates merging of databases constructed with responses to different questionnaires by enabling compatibility among questionnaires. each question is associated with keywords, related questions, and information on the population studied and the time of study. this maximizes the likelihood of compatibility among questionnaires and allows for identification of relevant questions for a particular study."

pmc2827443,"the authors introduce a new reproduction number, rh, which specifically focuses on household-to-household transmission and provides a clear epidemiological interpretation. this is in contrast to the existing clump-to-clump reproduction number, r*, which has a less informative interpretation due to the nonlinearity induced by the local saturation of susceptibles. the authors argue that rh is always informative about how much effort is required to safely contain the epidemic when vaccination is targeted at randomly selected households instead of randomly selected individuals. the authors present a construction similar to that leading to rh, but with a different motivation and derivation. in ball & neal  2002 , superimposed to global infections, local infections occur between individuals on a random contact network with specified degree distribution. in the infinite population limit, local saturation can be neglected, and the epidemic behaviour is mainly driven by the household-to-household reproduction number  an average value . on the contrary, already when μhμw is smaller than but close to 1, the time required for a clump to form may be so long that any realistic population size could be too small to make the exponential phase long enough to observe clumps reaching the end of their infectious period before the depletion of susceptibles in the population starts having a major role in the epidemic dynamics. the authors formally prove an inequality  equation  3.3   for the critical vaccination coverage for households, which provides an upper bound for the effort needed to safely contain the epidemic when vaccination is targeted at randomly selected households instead of randomly selected individuals. they argue that the information provided by both rh and rw should be taken into account and compared, since both parameters should be considered when social distancing control measures are implemented during an infection outbreak. the authors discuss the fact that the presence of workplaces in addition to households allows us to study the effect of the social distancing achieved when people stop going to work. school or workplace closure is not only feasible but also more difficult to study, since it is highly dependent on the time delays between infection, detection of a case, and policy implementation. real-time estimation methods remain invaluable tools, and much effort should be spent in identifying which data need to be collected and how. the authors comment on the fact that, in order to"

pmc2970847,"the current study demonstrates that overexpression of angiotensin- 1-7  or ace2, the enzyme that generates angiotensin- 1-7 , has protective effects against lung diseases, particularly involving lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. angiotensin- 1-7  has been shown to prevent the development of pulmonary hypertension and related cardiac pathophysiologies in the monocrotaline model of ph. the study shows that overexpression of angiotensin- 1-7  before induction of ph results in prevention of the elevated pressure and attenuation of the remodeling effects on the heart by inhibiting vascular remodeling. the study reveals that elevated lung mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines are observed in the mct model of ph, and overexpression of angiotensin- 1-7  prevents the increase in the mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines  il-1β, il-6, and tnf-α  and produces an increase in the antiinflammatory cytokine  il-10 . the study suggests that targeting of the pulmonary ace2/ang- 1-7 /mas axis could provide a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of lung diseases, particularly involving lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension, as most effective therapeutic effect may be accomplished with a dual treatment regimen due to the fact that some of the findings suggest that ace2 and ang- 1-7  mediate their protective effects by different pathways."
pmc4147700,"ccov is a highly contagious enteric virus that primarily affects dogs, but can also infect cats and, to a lesser extent, other animals and humans. ccov infection results in a mild, but highly contagious, enteritis in young dogs, with a range of clinical signs from loose stools to severe watery diarrhea, with high morbidity and variable mortality. ccov infection can cause atrophy of intestinal villi, shortening, and distortion of the sides and the tip of intestinal villous enterocytes, leading to sloughing of necrotic cells into the intestinal lumen. ccov infection results in a loss of normal digestive and absorptive functions and clinical signs similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  in humans and feline infectious peritonitis  fip  in cats, including pulmonary alveolar damage, fibrinous exudation, and lymphopenia. ccov infection can cause systemic spread, but only in cases of co-infection with other pathogens, such as canine parvovirus. ccov infection can result in a fatal multisystemic illness, with leukopenia and viral antigen present within the cytoplasm of infected villous enterocytes in the brain, lungs, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidneys, urinary bladder, and intestinal tract. ccov infection can result in the emergence of novel variants with altered tropism and pathogenesis, such as the ""pantropic"" ccov-iia viruses, which cause systemic and lethal illness. ccov infection can be identified by visualization of viral particles in stool specimens following negative staining and examination by transmission electron microscopy, but the definitive test is post-mortem identification of viral antigen by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections. ccov infection can be prevented by inactivated and modified-live virus vaccines, but current vaccines are safe but provide only incomplete protection, and treatment is mainly by supportive care, including good maintenance of fluid and"
pmc4429104,"this study reports on serological evidence of influenza a viruses in straw-colored fruit bats from ghana, with around 30% of the bat population showing antibody detection against certain subtypes. the findings suggest that bats may constitute asymptomatic mammalian carriers of influenza a viruses, which have a wide geographical distribution in birds and are recognized as possible candidates to cause a future pandemic. the study found no significant association in seropositivity between sex, age groups, sampling year, and season, but as sample size was small, potentially significant associations might have been missed. the study highlights the need for further surveillance in birds to prevent unnoticed reassortment events between circulating avian or potentially human influenza a virus strains, resulting in variants with yet unknown zoonotic potential. the findings have implications for public health, as e. helvum, the bat species studied, are widely consumed as bush meat in west africa, and the implications of the findings from a public health perspective remain to be investigated."
pmc3842692,"in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial involving 101 adults with acute bronchitis, the study medication, cineole, showed a statistically significant effect in reducing cough frequency after 4 days of treatment compared to placebo. cineole also demonstrated a statistically significant effect in reducing cough frequency after 4 days of treatment compared to placebo in patients with acute bronchitis, based on a mean duration since the occurrence of acute bronchitis symptoms of about 4 days. the study found that cineole is effective in treating acute bronchitis due to its proven pharmacodynamics and pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory and mucolytic effects. the study's findings are complementary to previous results showing anti-inflammatory and mucolytic effects of cineole in patients with rhinosinusitis, copd, and asthma, as the shown anti-tussive effects are also based on amelioration of inflammation and mucociliary clearance in patients with acute bronchitis. the study highlights the importance of selecting an effective symptom-sum-score, as the number of coughing fits is the most relevant parameter for demonstrating the progress of disease, with other parameters having only minor influence on the results. the study's findings also have socio-economic relevance, as the disorder affects approximately 5% of adults annually, it belongs to the 10 most common illnesses among outpatients, and relief of coughing and coughing fits occurs without significant increase of costs in comparison to other treatment options."

pmc4931667,"vimentin interacts with gram-negative bacteria, such as e. coli and salmonella, to recognize and mediate innate immune signaling. in e. coli, vimentin acts as a surface-attached receptor of aiec, an intestinal pathogen, and as a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2  nod2 -interacting protein, an intracellular prr, recognizing bacterial peptidoglycan fragments. in salmonella, vimentin is recruited to the membrane ruffles stimulated by the pathogen and mediates map kinase activation via the tyrosine phosphatase domain of sptp, an effector protein of salmonella that is secreted via the type iii secretion system. vimentin is a component of the cytoskeleton and is remodeled by the intracellular pathogen chlamydia trachomatis to form a dynamic scaffold that provides structural stability to the inclusion. the pathogen utilizes the virulence factor cpaf, an important factor for the full replicative potential of c. trachomatis, to modify and disassemble the vimentin scaffold. vimentin interacts with gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococcus pyogenes and mycobacterium tuberculosis. in streptococcus pyogenes, vimentin is upregulated on injured skeletal-muscle cells and is targeted by the bacterial toxin spya, a c3 family adp-ribosyltransferase. in mycobacterium tuberculosis, vimentin is downregulated in macrophages compared to infections with an avirulent m. tuberculosis strain, and the bacterial protein microaggregate-binding protein 1  mbp-1  induces vimentin polymerization at the site of the bacterium-host cell interface. vimentin interacts with viruses, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  sars-cov  and human immunodeficiency virus  hiv . in sars-cov, vimentin serves as a"

pmc4581848,"in a study investigating the role of interferon-inducible transmembrane  ifitm  proteins in viral entry, researchers found that ifitm1, ifitm2, and ifitm3 proteins, which are expressed in response to ifnα, can inhibit the entry of viruses from the flaviviridae, retroviridae, and lentiviridae families. this inhibition is achieved through the binding of ifitms to early endosome markers, such as rab5 and rab7, which prevents viruses from accessing their cellular receptors. in another study, researchers found that ifitm1 and ifitm3 proteins can also inhibit the entry of viruses from the nidoviridae family, including respiratory syncytial virus  rsv , by binding to the endosomal protein eea1. this binding prevents rsv from accessing its cellular receptor, the intercellular adhesion molecule 150  icam-150 , which is required for viral entry. in yet another study, researchers found that ifitm1 and ifitm3 proteins can also inhibit the entry of viruses from the coronaviridae family, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  sars-cov , by binding to early endosome markers, such as rab5 and rab7, which prevents viruses from accessing their cellular receptors. this binding also results in the accumulation of viral particles in early endosomes, which may contribute to the inhibition of viral entry. in all of these studies, the researchers used a variety of techniques to investigate the role of ifitms in viral entry, including transfection of cells with ifitm-expressing plasmids, infection of cells with viruses in the presence or absence of ifnα, and flow cytometry to monitor the cleavage of substrates by viral proteases. these findings suggest that ifitm proteins are a crucial component of the innate immune response against viral entry and may have potential applications in the development of antiviral therapies."

pmc112102,"the lcmv virus, when infecting mice, enhances the pathogenicity of antierythrocyte autoantibodies, leading to overt autoimmune diseases and death of the infected animals. the mechanism by which lcmv increases autoantibody pathogenicity appears to be enhancement of macrophage phagocytic activity, as shown by increased phagocytosis of antibody-coated red blood cells by macrophages from infected mice. the virus-mediated increase in autoantibody pathogenicity is currently under investigation and may be linked to an enhancement of macrophage expression of fcγ receptors, molecules involved in antierythrocyte antibody-induced anemia and upregulated by interferons and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. the pathogenicity of autoantibodies depends on their microenvironment, including the microbiological status of the host, and may provide interesting information on the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and possible alternative ways to treat them. other viruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus, can also enhance macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, suggesting that enhancement of macrophage phagocytic activity may be a mechanism shared by some viral infections to trigger or enhance autoimmune diseases."
pmc5231368,"lipid rafts, as membrane components, are involved in different stages of the viral life cycle of ibv, a prototype avian coronavirus, including viral attachment, entry, and genome replication. ibv structural proteins, particularly the spike protein  s , co-localize with lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, and the drug-induced disruption of lipid rafts in vero cells inhibited ibv infection, likely due to the role of lipid rafts in viral attachment. the ibv-susceptible cell lines a549 and df1 treated with mβcd before or after ibv attachment showed that the depletion of lipid rafts by mβcd suppressed ibv n expression in both cell lines when cells were treated with mβcd before ibv attachment, indicating that mβcd treatment directly inhibited ibv attachment and that drug-induced lipid raft disruption mainly blocked ibv attachment to host cells. the ibv s protein and other structural proteins likely interact with lipid rafts, which may increase the local concentration of viral structural proteins, particularly that of ibv s protein, to facilitate ibv infection. lipid rafts, as attachment factors, may promote viral adhesion to facilitate ibv endocytosis, and their involvement in ibv entry goes beyond this molecule, as pathogen-host interactions may promote lipid raft clustering and focal adhesion formation during endocytosis."
pmc3816157,"both cases presented in this report describe clinical remission of diabetes mellitus  dm  in cats with feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome  fcgs  under insulin therapy and a suitable diet. both cats had a previous history of fcgs, with one cat also having a documented feline calicivirus  fcv  infection. both cats had been treated previously with corticosteroids, which are considered a risk factor for dm in cats, and one cat had also been treated with long-acting corticosteroids. both cats required insulin therapy for dm control, and one cat required a change in insulin type due to difficulty in controlling dm. both cats presented with worsening fcgs symptoms during dm control, and oral rfeifn-ω  recombinant feline interferon omega  was successfully applied as an alternative to corticosteroids in both cases. in both cases, clinical improvement in fcgs symptoms was observed during oral rfeifn-ω therapy, with one cat showing a significant improvement in pain relief and reduced hypersalivation. both cats achieved clinical remission of dm without further insulin therapy requirement, while continuing oral rfeifn-ω therapy. the use of oral rfeifn-ω in these diabetic cats with fcgs provides further evidence for the successful use of this alternative therapy in cats where corticosteroid use is contraindicated."
pmc1193579,"the cotton rat  sigmodon hispidus  is a permissive host for hmpv replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, with peak virus titers of 103.6 pfu/g in the nasal turbinates and 104.4 pfu/g in the lungs on day 4 postinfection. hmpv infection in cotton rats is associated with significant inflammation in the lower respiratory tract, including disruption of the epithelial architecture, sloughing of epithelial cells, loss of ciliation, and presence of inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs. the cotton rat model of hmpv infection is sensitive to virus replication, with high titers of virus in both nose and lungs, and provides an appropriate animal model to study the pathogenesis of hmpv and the immune response to the virus. the cotton rat model is also useful to measure the effects of vaccines or prophylactic antibodies on virus replication and histopathology, as it allows for the use of cotton rat-specific immunologic and molecular reagents that are commercially available. the cotton rat model of hmpv infection is less permissive for rsv replication than cotton rats but may still be appropriate when particular immune mechanisms can be studied only in a murine system because of transgenic or knockout technologies or reagent availability."
pmc3429428,"the crystal structure of lassa np, an exonuclease from the arenavirus family of viruses, reveals two residues outside the catalytic site that are critical for binding to and processing rna. the first, y429, is the only residue that is essential for exonuclease activity and is involved in binding to the non-substrate strand. mutation of y429 to alanine or leucine allows binding but greatly inhibits the digestion of rna. the second, g392, provides specificity for rna within the active site and is completely conserved among all arenaviruses and also the coronaviruses. the structure of lassa np bound to rna suggests a different mode of binding of double-stranded substrates compared to other exonucleases. lassa np has a basic loop motif located in a projecting ""arm"" rather than above and to the right of the active site. this loop contains k516, k517, k518, and r519, although the side chains are disordered in this structure. other arenaviruses, such as junin and machupo, have a histidine at this position, which could provide a similar interaction with rna as a tyrosine. the crystal structure of lassa np reveals clashes would likely occur between the protein and b-form dna when modeling a b-form dna substrate. however, there do not appear to be any clashes when modeling an a-form ssdna substrate as part of a hybrid rna dna substrate. lassa np can only efficiently bind to and process a-form ssdna substrates. mutation of g392 to alanine disrupts both the exonuclease function and the immunosuppressive function of np. the position of the main-chain nitrogen afforded by the uniquely flexible glycine seems to be important for proper orientation of the 3' nucleotide of an incoming rna strand relative to critical residues of the active site. mutation of this residue to anything other than glycine would result in φ and ψ backbone dihedral angles outside allowable regions, unless several surrounding residues, including the active site d38"

pmc2808893,"recoding, also known as translational recoding, is the utilization of non-standard decoding during protein synthesis, which can benefit gene expression in various ways. recoding events can be programmed or promiscuous, and are often selected for during evolution due to their beneficial effects. recoding cassettes, which include sequence elements responsible for increasing the efficiency of recoding events, can be composed of diverse sequence elements that promote rearrangements of trna molecules or affect recognition of trnas or release factors in the ribosomal a-site. recoding provides a mechanism for the translation of downstream orfs on polycistronic rnas, as well as for setting a ratio between protein products produced from a single mrna in viruses and bacteria. recoding also allows for the incorporation of non-standard amino acids, such as selenocysteine, which requires the presence of specialized machinery such as selenocysteine trnas and translation factors."
pmc4353853,"the study found that a single amino acid substitution at position 156 in the heavy chain of the hla-a*24 allele, commonly associated with autoimmune disorders and viral infections, can influence the presentation of peptides by the hla class i molecule, resulting in altered peptide repertoire and structure. the study demonstrated that hla-a*24 06 and hla-a*24 13, which contain amino acid substitutions at position 156, are more independent of the tapasin  tpn  component of the peptide loading complex  plc  than hla-a*24 02. this suggests that they have increased stability in the absence of tpn and present a more peptide receptive environment, potentially allowing the presentation of non-optimized ligands with unusual length during viral infections. the study also found that other known tpn independent alleles, such as hla-b*44, demonstrate increased protein stability. the study highlights the need for a systematic analysis to understand the impact of hla mismatches, as differences in both tpn dependency and peptide repertoire for variants with single mismatches at residue 156 described in both the b*44 and a*24 groups may have implications for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  hsct . the study suggests that the presentation of unusual ligands by tpn independent alleles could be considered an overlooked factor that may need to be considered more carefully during donor selection for hsct, as it represents an advantage for viral immunity but could also be considered disadvantageous due to the presentation of non-optimized ligands."
pmc3001728,"in a study of 98 episodes of febrile neutropenia in immunocompromised patients, the overall sensitivity for detecting respiratory viruses using flocked nasal swabs  fns  was 65%. the sensitivity for detecting rhinovirus using fns was 78%. when compared to nasopharyngeal aspirate  npa , fns showed a ""substantial"" agreement for any virus and an ""almost perfect"" agreement for rhinovirus according to landis and koch's scale. fns collected a lower amount of epithelial cells compared to npa, and there was a possible association between a high cell yield and low cycle threshold  ct  values for npa. the sensitivity for detecting any virus using fns was significantly lower than using npa. the sensitivity for detecting rhinovirus using fns was lower than using npa in a study of immunocompromised adults, but it was slightly better when compared to previous investigations using fns with a comparable insertion depth. the lower sensitivity for fns may be explained by less mucus production and consequently less anterior transport of viral nucleic acid in immunocompromised individuals. fns sampling of the nares for viral detection in immunocompromised individuals cannot be recommended until further large studies have revealed more promising results."

pmc3393364,"the study found that within 2 to 4 days after symptom onset, patients with severe influenza disease had significantly higher elisa titers for antibodies against the split-virion inactivated a h1n1 pdm09 vaccine than patients with mild disease, suggesting an exaggerated nonneutralizing antibody response during early infection in severe cases. the study also found that patients requiring positive pressure ventilation, representing those with the most severe respiratory disease, had higher elisa titers than those who did not require positive pressure ventilation, indicating that the nonneutralizing antibody response was associated with severe respiratory disease. the study revealed that the amount of nonneutralizing antibody, as measured by the elisa/mn titer ratio, was higher for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease, suggesting that an exaggerated nonneutralizing antibody response during early infection may play a role in the outcome of influenza. the study showed that antibody avidity, as assessed by comparing the elisa od values with and without urea, was higher for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease, indicating that patients with severe disease have higher levels of secondary antibody production, presumably from memory b cells. the study found that antibody avidity, as measured by the antibody avidity index, was independently associated with severe disease, suggesting that antibody avidity may be a predictor for severe disease."
pmc3165806,"the study confirms that deletion of the entire mhv 5′utr is lethal for virus replication and reveals that the genome carrying this deletion is defective in directing subgenomic rna synthesis. this suggests that the mhv 5′utr, including the cis-acting stem-loop structures sl1, sl2, and sl4, plays a critical role in subgenomic rna synthesis during mhv replication. the study demonstrates that sl4, as one of the cis-acting elements in the mhv 5′utr, functions as a structural spacer element that properly orients sl1, sl2, trs, and/or more distal structural elements of the 5′utr. this structural spacer function is relatively less important for virus replication than the spacing between sl4 and other 5′utr stem-loops. the study shows that deletion of 131aca133 has a profound impact on virus replication and viruses carrying this deletion are heterogeneous in phenotype  plaque size  and are not genetically stable, with isolation of second-site revertants in a number of places in the 5′utr, which compensates the decreased plaque sizes, delayed growth kinetics, and lower peak titer associated with 131aca133 deletion. this suggests that there is an optimal spacing between sl4 and sl1 and/or sl2. the study suggests that the distance between sl4 and sl1 and/or sl2 is important for virus replication, as viruses with more than two ucuaa repeats in the wild-type mhv-a59 evolve the number of repeats downward with serial passage  26 . this is consistent with the idea that there is an optimal spacing between sl4 and sl1 and/or sl2. the study shows that the mhv genome can tolerate the deletion of either sl4a or sl4b and yield viable viruses. replacing sl4 with a sequence-unrelated shorter stem-loop structure  sl4-r  permits recovery of infectious recombinant virus, providing a further indication that the sequence of sl4 is relatively less"

pmc6213290,"the present study reveals that epac1 plays a critical role during ebov infection in endothelial cells by regulating viral uptake via modulation of the pi3k signaling pathway-mediated filoviral macropinocytosis. inactivation of epac1 by esis significantly attenuates ebov infection in endothelial cells by abrogating the creation of ebov-induced macropinocytosis formed in the ruffling regions of the endothelial plasma membrane, suggesting that ebov gp-mediated virus uptake requires the involvement of the host camp-epac1 signaling pathway. owing to the generally large size of filamentous particles, these viruses are predominantly taken up through macropinocytosis in which classic clathrin-, caveolin-, and phagocytosis-mediated endocytosis is not critically involved. epac1 is known to regulate all of the aforementioned cellular functions, but the precise molecular mechanism s  by which epac1 controls ebov uptake is not clear. the present study using an ex vivo model reveals a novel role for epac1 in ebov infection, namely epac1 governs ebov internalization via regulation of pi3k pathway-mediated filoviral macropinocytosis in vascular endothelial cells."

pmc6057395,"a review by hemila et al.  2013  found that therapeutic doses of vitamin c  0.2g/day or more  can shorten the duration of the common cold, but with no statistical significance due to heterogeneity related to sex and dosage. however, studies by elwood pc and tyrrell da indicated that mere therapeutic doses of vitamin c are effective in men rather than women, reducing the main duration, nasal congestion or running nose, and limb and muscle pain. vitamin c is the most effective water-soluble antioxidant in human plasma, concentrated in leukocytes, and its concentration rapidly declines during infections and stress. vitamin c supplementation improves the ability to resist infection by improving the activities of the immune system, such as antimicrobial and natural killer cell activities, lymphocyte proliferation, chemotaxis, and delayed-type hypersensitivity. it also contributes to hormone regulation, including activation of the sympathetic nervous system and secretion of epinephrine during abnormal stress. the combination of supplemental and therapeutic doses of vitamin c is capable of relieving chest pain, fever, and chills, as well as shortening the time of confinement indoors and mean duration. data availability  all data are contained within the paper. a large dose of vitamin c during the common cold, usually 3.0g/day to 4.0g/day, can better recover health, while administration of extra doses of vitamin c at the onset of a common cold can help reduce the duration by about half a day, shorten the time confined indoors by about 10 hours, and relieve symptoms of a common cold, including chest pain, fever, and chills. language limitations weakened the exactness and representativeness of the study's data, as in some cases, the data had to be calculated and transformed rather than being available directly. therapeutic rcts must be conducted according to stricter, more precise guidelines to gain more knowledge on this subject. conflicts of interest  the authors declare no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper."

pmc5691660,"viruses can use their own nascent rna as a scaffold to recruit host transcription factors, such as the viral transactivator protein vp160 in human cytomegalovirus  hcmv , to promote viral gene expression. this allows viruses to hijack host transcriptional machinery and redirect it to their own benefit. viruses can use host-capped rnas as primers for rna synthesis, such as in the case of the human immunodeficiency virus  hiv  and the simian immunodeficiency virus  siv , to generate new rna molecules for viral gene expression. this allows viruses to produce rna molecules that can bypass host rna surveillance mechanisms, such as the exosome and the 5'-3' exonuclease xrn1, and promote viral replication. viruses can use termination of nascent rna synthesis to create sub-genomic rnas, such as in the case of the retrovirus human t-cell leukemia virus  htlv  and the flavivirus dengue virus  denv , to generate regulatory rna molecules that undergo a different fate than the main viral rna genome. this allows viruses to create regulatory rna molecules that can be used as microrna  mirna  precursors or as decoy rnas to prevent cleavage of the viral rna genome during mirna processing by the microprocessor complex. viruses can down-regulate host nascent rna production for their own benefit, such as in the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  coronavirus  cov  and the herpes simplex virus 1  hsv-1 , to trigger global degradation of host rna. this allows viruses to redirect the host transcriptional machinery to their own viral expression and deprive the host cell of targets for the immune system, leading to lowering host protein production during infection. viruses can use nascent rna synthesis to regulate their own gene expression, such as in the case of the epstein-barr virus  ebv  and the human papillomavirus  hpv , to produce"
pmc4054348,"bat coronaviruses  betacoronaviruses and alphacoronaviruses  have different circulation and transmission dynamics in bat populations. betacoronaviruses, which are most associated with emerging human infectious diseases, have been found in rhinolophus spp. bats from other species in africa and asia show far greater genetic distance to betacoronaviruses than those from rhinolophus spp. this is especially true for viruses from africa, which share less than 83% full genomic identities with betacoronaviruses. the host range of sars-like coronaviruses  covs  is restricted mainly to rhinolophus spp. but with wide geographic locations. in the present study, sars-like coronaviruses were detected only in 2 of 14 bats in baoshan, and this sample size was too small to permit detection of alphacoronaviruses, but betacoronaviruses were not found in 254 bats from the other three locations, which supports the conclusion that there is a restricted distribution of betacoronaviruses in the bat population. the gene encoding spike protein s is the highly variable region within the cov genome. the rbm of sars covs is a unique element that initiates viral infection by specifically binding to the ace2 receptor of human and civet cells. two critical amino acid residues on rbm  479n and 487t  determine the efficiency of receptor binding since substitution of both abolishes viral binding to human ace2, thereby abrogating the viral infection. substitution of either residue alone, however, has no significant impact on human ace2 binding. lyra11, together with rs3367, is a gap-filling virus and likely has the ability to directly infect humans. this discovery provides an important clue to the origin of sars cov from bat sars-like covs and presents the strongest evidence so far that bats are the natural hosts of sars covs. due to their unique mechanism of viral rna replication, covs are prone to recombination during double infections. previous studies have suggested that"

pmc4393285,"in a study of reported physical contacts in great britain, a contact matrix was found to have a high number of child-dominated contacts, with adults making fewer contacts than children. this suggests that children may play a significant role in the transmission of respiratory infections. a simulation study using this contact matrix showed that when the probability of infection is introduced into an under 20 age group, the estimated reproduction number  r  is significantly lower than when infection is introduced into an over 20 age group. this highlights the importance of considering age-specific susceptibility in r estimation. in a study of reported physical contacts in southern china, a contact matrix was found to have a high number of adult-dominated contacts, with adults making more contacts than children. this suggests that adults may be more important than children in the transmission of respiratory infections in this setting. a simulation study using this contact matrix showed that when the probability of infection is introduced into an over 20 age group, the estimated r is significantly lower than when infection is introduced into a generic adult-dominated next generation matrix. this highlights the importance of considering age-specific contact patterns in r estimation. in a study of reported physical contacts in eight european countries, a contact matrix was found to have an average number of contacts across all age groups. this suggests that age-specific susceptibility may not be important in r estimation for these settings. however, when the simulation model assumes the average contact patterns across these settings, the estimated r is significantly lower than when infection is introduced into an over 20 age group. this highlights the importance of considering age-specific contact patterns in r estimation for settings where adults have lower contact rates than children."
pmc2168833,"antiviral antibodies play a critical role in suppressing replication and preventing the selection of ctl escape variant viruses during both acute and chronic stages of infection. this is illustrated in the study by the authors, as jhmv-infected balb/b jhd mice with suboptimal antibody protection develop high virus burdens and ctl escape variants, while optimally protected mice do not. ctl escape most commonly occurs in the presence of a ctl response exhibiting high selective pressure, as observed in jhd mice, where ctl escape variants are selected in all infected mice. a robust antiviral neutralizing antibody response, in combination with high-avidity ctl responses, decreases the likelihood of ctl escape by limiting virus replication and persistence. this is supported by the poorly controlled growth of ctl escape variant viruses in jhmv-infected balb/b jhd mice. when antiviral antibody responses are suboptimal or absent, high-avidity ctl responses may not effectively control virus replication or limit persistence, and the adaptive immune response that is focused solely on immunodominant ctl epitopes may more readily select for ctl escape variant viruses. the selection of ctl escape variant viruses is influenced by the magnitude and functional avidity of ctl responses and is more common when virus clearance is delayed, as observed in hiv-infected patients. however, the authors' results are the first to directly establish a link between antiviral antibody responses, diminished virus clearance, and the selection of ctl escape variant viruses."

pmc150617,"the study found that mice lacking the chemokine ccl3  also known as mcp-3  are more susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus  mhv  infection due to reduced cd8+ t cell accumulation and activation in the brain. in the absence of ccl3 signaling, cd8+ t cells exhibit reduced interferon-gamma  ifn-γ  production and limited cytotoxic activity, which contributes to impaired virus-specific cd8+ t cell effector function and disease. the study also found that ccl3 is necessary for amplifying cd8+ t cell effector function and specifically affecting cd8+ t cell and macrophage trafficking following viral infection. the study revealed that ccl3 expression is crucial not only in leukocyte recruitment to the site of infection but also in cd8+ t cell activation. the study showed that in the absence of ccl3 signaling, cd8+ t cells are capable of generating an antigen-specific response but are unable to generate effective t cells in host defense following viral infection of the brain due to altered migration potential, inability to produce ifn-γ, and deficient cytotoxic activity."

pmc5776035,"multistate models, which allow estimation of survival, recapture, and transition rates between infectious and non-infectious states, were used to analyze coronavirus data in bats. this method provided estimates for these parameters and allowed for the grouping of bats into persistently infectious bats and transiently infectious bats. the cmr study in smith's work [21] had relatively high recapture rates due to the finding of a lifting hole of a bridge where bats, infected with coronavirus, roosted with a high affinity to their colony. however, fluctuating recapture rates across capturing occasions in the cmr data highlighted the difficulty of recapturing specific bats during the entire sampling period, which might be associated with trap-shy and adaptive methods of capturing. the results of model selection processes indicated that population-level viral persistence was marginally more probable when infectious periods were heterogeneous  bats were either transiently or persistently infectious  and explored various scenarios in epidemic models. the study provided much validity by using larger numbers of bats sampled [21], although the sample size is still not large enough to provide robust estimates. fluctuating recapture rates across capturing occasions in the cmr data, which might be associated with trap-shy and adaptive methods of capturing, highlighted the difficulty of recapturing specific bats during the entire sampling period. this finding underscores the need for individual bat tracking data with infection states to improve our understanding of infection dynamics of bat-borne viruses."
pmc6039859,"the structure of a network plays a more significant role than epidemiological parameters, such as pathogen transmission rates and immunizing effects, in determining epidemic outbreak magnitude. network connectivity, clustering, and uniqueness  r  are the most important factors influencing epidemic outbreak magnitude, with r being positively associated with outbreak magnitude. the dynamics and outcome of an epidemic event are affected by network structure in complicated ways that cannot be captured by individual basic network properties, and that offer a way to prioritize preparedness efforts by focusing preventive and surveillance actions on the most vulnerable networks. the structure of a network is a main determinant of epidemic patterns, with complex features of the airline network being at heart of the global spread dynamics of diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome. measuring the distance between the source and the target of an infection in network space can provide a more reliable prediction of epidemic spread rate than geographical distance, regardless of the nature of the disease."

pmc5829646,"in a large tertiary hospital, sample collection dates associated with microbiological testing are highly correlated with patient admission dates, with a high concordance of collection date and admission date for over 99% of samples with a listed collection date. this correlation is even stronger for inpatient testing, with collection dates allowing imputation of admission dates to the resolution of a week for over 90% of samples. for bacterial/fungal culture tests, the average length of stay is ∼1 week, and metadata such as the setting of care can be gleaned from the type of microbiological organism sequenced. for viral tests, the correlation with admission date is higher for tests sent to the clinical laboratory in early admission and can be used to rule-in or rule-out infectious diseases through metagenomics, to detect antimicrobial or antiviral resistance, and to impute the transmission source. for both bacterial and viral tests, the collection dates allow imputation of the transmission source through metagenomics, and sequence data obtained for the detection of antimicrobial resistance can also be used for public health measures and infection prevention. the emergence of rich infectious disease genomic databases creates a pressure for clinical laboratories to share sample metadata and a demand for community guidance as to the manner in which such clinical metadata can appropriately be shared. clinical laboratories and phylodynamics practitioners can take advantage of expert determination provisions for de-identification of data, or they can obtain blanket consent from patients to share such data. alternatively, the clinical, scientific, and public health communities can determine that the benefits outweigh the costs and change privacy rules around high-resolution sample collection date sharing."
pmc4676028,"in the context of the 2013-14 chinese avian influenza a h7n9  outbreak, this study identified two major clusters of infection based on geographic distribution and epidemic curves, which were further associated with distinct meteorological factors. the first cluster, mainly located in the eastern coastal provinces, was related to high temperatures and low humidity, while the second cluster, mainly located in the central and western inland provinces, was related to low temperatures and high humidity. the study also found that the risk of human infection with avian influenza a h7n9  viruses in china was significantly associated with meteorological factors, including temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. specifically, high temperatures, especially above 20℃, and low humidity, especially below 60%, were significantly associated with an increased risk of infection, while low temperatures, especially below 5℃, and high humidity, especially above 80%, were also significantly associated with an increased risk of infection. in addition, the study highlighted the importance of considering both spatial and temporal distributions of meteorological factors, as well as their interactions, in the context of emerging infectious diseases. this was demonstrated by the finding that the temporal distribution of the 2013-14 chinese avian influenza a h7n9  outbreaks was significantly associated with both high temperatures and low humidity, while the spatial distribution was significantly associated with both low temperatures and high humidity. the study also emphasized the need for further investigation into the potential interactions between meteorological factors, as well as their effects on the transmission dynamics of emerging infectious diseases, given the complex and nonlinear relationships between meteorological factors and infection risks. finally, the study suggested that the identified climate factors could provide important insights into the potential transmission pathways and risk factors of emerging infectious diseases, which could facilitate the development of more effective prevention and control strategies."

pmc5317157,"a study conducted in singapore found that a new platform called pathchip, developed by the genome institute of singapore  gis , can detect viral respiratory pathogens beyond what is covered by traditional multiplex polymerase chain reaction  pcr  panels used for respiratory infections. the study analyzed 184 respiratory samples from a community-acquired respiratory infection cohort and 114 samples from hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection. the platform automatically detects which pathogens' recognition signatures are present based on a proprietary algorithm constructed based on genetic sequences of viruses clinically relevant to humans. the study found that the platform can detect 12 viruses, including influenza a and b, respiratory syncytial virus a and b, parainfluenza virus 1, parainfluenza virus 2, parainfluenza virus 3, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus a/b, adenovirus a/b/c/d/e, and human coronaviruses 229e/nl63 and human coronaviruses oc43. the study compared the ability of standard pcr and multiplex pcr to detect influenza in terms of days post-onset and cycle threshold values. the study found that the gis-pathchip can add to detection above routinely available multiplex pcr assays, and viruses were grouped into panel viruses, non-panel viruses for which ari is a common presentation, and non-ari viruses. the study compared the discriminatory performance by calculating the positive likelihood ratio  lr+  and its 95% confidence intervals  ci  for positive detection of influenza and any viral infection. the study also investigated the effect of age on the discriminatory performance. the study found that the proportion of episodes fulfilling different criteria was compared by viral pathogen status, and estimates of lr+ require assumptions on the anticipated prevalence of influenza. for community-acquired respiratory infection, this was assumed to be what was obtained in ari samples from the community cohort. for hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection, since influenza-positive inpatients were intentionally overs"
pmc3978900,"a recent study investigating the presence of shiga-toxigenic e. coli in a clinical sample used pcr- and dna-based identification methods, but even these might not be adequate for recognizing causation, since such false associations could lead to potentially dangerous treatments and might be harder to disprove than to generate initially. in fact, many of the pathogens that have been discovered through this approach fail to meet koch's postulates for causality, as it is sometimes not possible to culture the pathogen or to identify a suitable animal model for further studies. for example, in a study of nasopharyngeal swabs taken from individuals in the 2009 h1n1 pandemic, one sample contained a pair of reads that mapped with 97% nucleotide identity to ebola virus, but after further investigation, this finding was concluded to be contamination. in such circumstances, care must be taken not to create spurious links between infectious agents and disease, since such false associations could lead to potentially dangerous treatments and might be harder to disprove than to generate initially. instead, metagenomic investigations of the microbiome could become so standard that dna sequencers could be used in household toilets to monitor changes in stool microbiome content, which could then be used to guide interventions to maintain health. the identification of a novel or complex infectious disease might require additional targeted diagnostic tests to further understand the clinical disease and determine management options. for example, urinary catheters could be treated with prebiotics to reduce the risk of colonization by harmful bacteria. the greatest value of metagenomics is in clinical cases where conventional techniques fail to find a microbial cause. in fact, it has been suggested that metagenomic investigations of the microbiome could become so standard that they could be used as a complementary technique to be used alongside culture and other traditional methods for pathogen detection in a public health laboratory, and for inter-laboratory comparison of results. as whole-genome sequencing technologies decrease in price and increase in speed and simplicity, it is expected that metagenomics approaches will be applied more often in public health emergencies, and routine diagnostic pipelines are likely to evolve from ongoing collaborations between researchers and clinicians."

pmc103966,"this study demonstrates that ebola virus glycoprotein  gp  is endoproteolytically processed into two subunits, gp1 and gp2, during maturation, and that gp2, which is homologous to the tm glycoproteins of the oncoretroviruses, is cleaved after a conserved dibasic motif in all known strains of ebola virus and marburg virus. the study shows that ebola virus glycoprotein processing is not required for viral entry, as the uncleavable glycoprotein mutant ebola gp.cl -  was able to mediate viral entry into a variety of cell types as efficiently as the wild-type glycoprotein, indicating that, unlike most other cleaved viral glycoproteins, endoproteolytic processing is not required for ebola virus glycoprotein function. the study suggests that endoproteolytic processing of ebola virus glycoprotein may be important for viral replication only in certain cell types, as the absolute conservation of the dibasic cleavage site in all filoviruses might suggest that endoproteolytic processing of ebola gp is critical for some stage of the viral life cycle. the study reveals that ebola virus glycoprotein processing is not required for viral growth in the cells of vertebrates, as the virus retains the ability to grow in the cells of vertebrates, albeit with significantly reduced efficiency, as seen in the case of the sindbis virus e2 glycoprotein. the study suggests that the absolute conservation of the cleavage site in all filoviruses might provide important clues for the identification of the elusive ebola virus reservoir, as the analysis of the ability of mlv ebo gp  and mlv ebo gp.cl -   to infect a very wide selection of different cell types from diverse species might provide important clues for the identification of the elusive ebola virus reservoir."
pmc3471632,"in a large longitudinal surveillance study of polyomavirus kipyv and wupyv in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, 37% of patients had prolonged detection episodes, and young age and detection of a respiratory virus within the previous 2 weeks were independent risk factors for detection of kipyv or wupyv. kipyv and wupyv were commonly co-detected with respiratory viruses, and concurrent detection of polyomaviruses and respiratory viruses was associated with prolonged detection episodes and high viral copy numbers in respiratory specimens. the seroprevalence of antibodies to kipyv and wupyv for children 5–20 years of age was similar to that for adults, suggesting that primary exposure occurs in childhood. in a cohort of 136 nasal wash specimens from hct recipients with respiratory illnesses, respiratory viruses were often co-detected with kipyv and wupyv, and a respiratory virus infection was an independent risk factor for kipyv detection. in conclusion, the study did not find a clear role for these viruses as respiratory pathogens with classic upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms, although further investigations may be necessary to elucidate the role of these viruses in highly immunocompromised patients."
pmc6449104,"the development of hai-ipc guidelines involves extracting relevant data from the literature review, synthesizing the literature, interpreting the evidence, and grading available evidence  where relevant  using criteria outlined in table 1. some guidelines are mostly descriptive and informed by expert opinion due to the absence of published evidence for common infection prevention and control issues. expert opinion is also essential during the early phases of an epidemic brought on by a newly emerging pathogen as peer-reviewed publications are often limited under these circumstances. recommendations for public health practice are informed by health care epidemiology, monitoring and analysis of ipc issues and trends, as well as feedback from stakeholders and provincial/territorial partners. advice provided by nac-ipc complements provincial/territorial efforts and considers all relevant federal, provincial, territorial, and local legislation, regulations, and policies."

pmc136582,"the np gene of ndv, which is already engaged in performing multiple essential functions throughout the virus cycle, can be engineered to fulfill additional functions, such as displaying foreign epitopes and inducing protective immunity against unrelated pathogens. deletion of the complete helix peak in the np gene of velogenic strain of ndv did not prevent the generation of infectious recombinant ndv, while deletion of a partial helix structure in ndv-δ12 did not lead to the recovery of infectious ndv. replacement of np sequence  amino acids 444 to 459  with an equivalent number of mhv amino acids or replacement of 12 amino acids at positions 444 to 455 of the np with 10 amino acids comprising the 5b19 mhv epitope resulted in genetically stable viruses expressing foreign epitopes. all chickens vaccinated with ndv-δ18, ndv-mhv1, or ndv-mhv2 completely lacked antibodies directed against the deleted ide as determined by 18-mer np-peptide-based elisa, while all sera from animals immunized with conventional live or inactivated vaccines were positive with the np peptide elisa, indicating 100% sensitivity and specificity of the test at least under laboratory conditions. recombinant vectors, such as herpesvirus of turkey  hvt  and fowlpox virus expressing ndv f and/or hn, have been successfully constructed and their safety and efficacy have been studied, and administration of a combined np-based live marker ndv vaccine with a vector vaccine, for instance hvt expressing f and/or hn, into day-old chickens will have an advantage in providing long-lasting local and systemic immunity and avoids the necessity of revaccination and repeated handling of chickens."
pmc5628105,"niclosamide, a drug approved for treating parasitic infections, has shown preclinical activity in multiple disease models beyond its approved medical use, including cancer, metabolic diseases, and multiple types of infections. niclosamide has demonstrated beneficial effects in disease models related to cancer, such as colon and prostate cancer, and has shown activity against viruses, bacteria, and fungi. niclosamide has also demonstrated beneficial effects in models of systemic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, artery constriction, endometriosis, neuro-pathic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, graft-versus-host disease, and systemic sclerosis. niclosamide has pleotropic biological activities and has the potential to interact with multiple biological targets due to its ability to affect signaling pathways and its structural features associated with pleotropic pharmacologic activity. the pharmacokinetic properties of niclosamide need improvement through re-formulation or pro-drug strategies to make more widespread use of this drug, as well as the development of novel niclosamide derivatives that are biased toward targeting specific signaling pathways or biological functions in specific systemic diseases."

pmc6598302,"the analysis of 10 years of clinical trials.gov data revealed that id trials are well represented in the overall clinical research landscape, but the distribution of studies is not consistent with the us or global burden of disease. this highlights the discrepancy between the market forces that drive drug development and where clinical need may actually be greatest. the analysis found that hepatitis c trials were overrepresented compared with global and us mortality and disability rates, possibly because of the greater burden of certain ids in children. this suggests that some of the overrepresentation of hepatitis c could have been averted through greater collaboration of industry, funding sources, and researchers. the analysis showed that lrti trials continued to be underrepresented, constituting only 6.6% of the id studies registered and 35.8% of infection-related global deaths. this indicates that resources are being invested disproportionately across the id spectrum, and a multiple-stakeholder approach to funding that incorporates the perspectives of industry, funding agencies, and policy makers may be better able to direct how resources are allocated and research areas prioritized such that public health needs are better matched to the market forces that drive much of the clinical trial enterprise. the analysis found that malaria, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, childhood cluster diseases, and meningitis were also underrepresented compared with their very low prevalences in the us. this suggests that resources are being invested disproportionately across the id spectrum, and a multiple-stakeholder approach to funding that incorporates the perspectives of industry, funding agencies, and policy makers may be better able to direct how resources are allocated and research areas prioritized such that public health needs are better matched to the market forces that drive much of the clinical trial enterprise. the analysis showed that trial sponsors are generally focused on their respective studies and do not examine the entire portfolio of interventional id research. this highlights the need for a more holistic approach to id research that considers the broader public health impact of interventions and the need for greater collaboration among industry, funding agencies, and policy makers to ensure that resources are allocated and research areas prioritized in a way that better aligns with public health needs."
pmc5295477,"the study involved a limited number of patients with respiratory failure, making it difficult to establish a control group with favorable conditions. the authors developed an ecmo transport system using general-service ambulances due to limited funds and economic burdens associated with other options for patients. patients with respiratory failure were transported using ambu-bag ventilation, and ecmo experts and clinical perfusionists with nursing experience were included in the transport team to cope with any problems that may occur during transport. the authors identified no difficulty in maintaining proper blood oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations during transport, and the time needed to prepare the equipment did not impede the rapid deployment of a general-service ambulance. the authors believe that their ecmo transport system with ambu-bag ventilation is a safe and useful interhospital transport method for respiratory failure patients, as it can be established without a financial burden on the developing organization and is a good alternative option for ecmo interhospital transport systems in korean hospitals with limited resources."
pmc6180471,"in a study examining the effectiveness of ecmo support in critically ill patients, hospital survival was achieved in 72% of patients, which is in agreement with data reported in developed countries. the authors attribute this to the use of more rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria, which resulted in restricting the use of ecmo to highly selected patients, and to the provision of adequate training and experience to the multidisciplinary team. the authors also found that the initial tidal volume of patients who died was lower than that of survivors, suggesting greater severity of lung injuries and poorer lung compliance in the former. the simplified acute physiology score 3  saps 3  did not differ in survivors and nonsurvivors, but the respiratory score was higher in survivors. the authors noted that severe hypoxemia may occur during the acute phase of respiratory support and sometimes needs to be tolerated by the team, but it does not directly affect survival or cognitive outcome. they also found that energy failure was avoided by using a hand pump for one patient and by turning off the warning lights for another patient. the authors reported that only decreases in oxygen saturation less than 85% and greater than 70% were observed, which occurred because of the severity of lung injury, associated with a cardiac output. severe hypoxemia may occur during the acute phase of respiratory support, and this complication may not directly affect survival or cognitive outcome. the authors highlighted that the most serious problems that arose during transport were addressed, such as avoiding energy failure by using a hand pump for one patient and by turning off the warning lights for another patient. only decreases in oxygen saturation less than 85% and greater than 70% were observed, which occurred because of the severity of lung injury, associated with a cardiac output. severe hypoxemia may occur during the acute phase of respiratory support, but it does not directly affect survival or cognitive outcome."
pmc3122663,"the lam-pcr assay, a new diagnostic technique, has been found to be more sensitive than nested pcr in detecting mycobacterium tuberculosis  m. tuberculosis  infection in low-copy-number cerebrospinal fluid  csf  samples, with a sensitivity of 88.23% in culture-negative cases, as reported in this study. the lam-pcr assay, which can provide clinical confirmation in culture-positive cases, is also useful in clinical confirmation in culture-negative cases where the bacterial load is low. the study found that the lam-pcr assay can be beneficial for detecting m. tuberculosis infection in clinically suspicious cases when small mycobacterial loads are present, as it takes only 60 minutes, compared to 3 to 4 hours for other molecular tests, making it beneficial for tertiary healthcare centers that require quick results. the study suggests that the threshold limit for interpreting results in lam-pcr assay should vary according to the biological fluid analyzed and the microbial load it harbors, as it may be necessary to have a lower threshold limit for csf and a higher threshold limit for sputum samples for the same infection, such as tuberculosis, for the assays to be clinically meaningful. the study highlights the importance of designing appropriate primers targeting high-copy-number genes, such as is6110, to improve the sensitivity of the lam-pcr assay, as demonstrated by the authors' work on serial dilutions by spiking a control csf sample with known concentrations of m. tuberculosis."
pmc6699014,"the present case describes a suspected congenital proximal urethral stricture in a 2-year-old female cat, which is a rare finding in cats and has not been previously reported. the stricture is characterized by a membranous structure arising from the urethral mucosa near the bladder neck, causing a sharp reduction in the proximal urethral diameter. management by fluoroscopy-guided balloon dilation proved to be a successful and minimally invasive option, with a good outcome and no associated complications or signs of re-obstruction noted 12 months post-procedure. retrograde urethrography showed persistent mild narrowing of the stricture site, but normal flow of contrast into the bladder and resolution of clinical signs. the location and nature of the stricture suggest a congenital origin, as it does not correlate with a natural narrowing point of the urethra and is considered a membrane based on its clinical appearance."
pmc3405768,"in a cross-sectional study of 522 qualified nurses in london, the seasonal influenza vaccination rate was 37%, higher than previous reports in healthcare workers  ranging from 14.3% to 26.4%  and similar to a reported vaccination coverage of 16% in nurses in elderly care units. this suggests that increased risk perception due to the 2009 influenza pandemic may have contributed to the higher vaccination rate. a lack of knowledge about influenza and vaccination was a strong predictor of nurses' vaccination behaviors, especially for those never vaccinated. this cluster had the lowest knowledge score and suggests that increasing their knowledge might improve their vaccination behaviors. between those occasionally vaccinated and continuously vaccinated, knowledge levels were not significantly different, but the newly vaccinated in 2009 had on average higher knowledge scores than those continuously vaccinated. this may reflect an increase in their risk perceptions towards influenza due to widespread reporting of the risks in the media encouraging them to be vaccinated for the first time in their lives. concerns about the vaccine's side-effects and effectiveness or safety were the two most frequent reasons for not having a vaccination, indicating continuing misconceptions about influenza vaccine in nurses. unvaccinated nurses also reported 'no need' as their reason not having a vaccination, consistent with their low-risk perception of contracting influenza. the perception of personal vulnerability to illness was important in nurses making vaccination decisions, but concerns about the negative personal consequences of contracting influenza and its sequelae, rather than nurses' professional duty to protect patients or other vulnerable groups, were the focus of nurses' reasons for having vaccination. future educational campaigns may wish to consider providing targeted information to change these widespread myths in nurses."
pmc110390,"the study identified a protein function in byrovirus replication that is separable from its proteolytic activity, indicating that l-pro has an additional role in rna amplification. the study revealed that the product of orf 8, p21, plays an important role in rna amplification and transcription, as a mutant lacking its start codon resulted in a fivefold reduction in rna accumulation. the study found that the putative rna helicase encoded in orfs 2 to 8 is dispensable for rna accumulation at the single-cell level, as a mutant lacking the 3'-terminal part of the genome resulted in reduced amplification efficiency. the study determined that the cleavage between l-pro and the remainder of the orf 1a product is essential for genome amplification, as a mutant with a deletion removing the cleavage site was replication incompetent. the study showed that the leader proteinase domain of l-pro is conserved among closteroviruses, as the remaining about three-fourths of the variable n-terminal domain did not exhibit any conserved sequence motifs that could be targeted for mutagenesis."

pmc5306530,"over the 12-year study period, the number of overall fall-related attendance in hong kong increased substantially, with a significant increase in non-fracture cases. during disease outbreaks, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  and h1n1 outbreaks, the number of admitted patients in hong kong's accident and emergency  a&e  department decreased, with a more pronounced decrease in the number of fracture cases. the study suggests that structural changes in the resource usage of a&e departments, such as providing more community care, primary care, community education, and changing admission criteria, may relieve possible inappropriate usage of a&e services due to overcrowding. the study highlights the need for more effective preventive measures for fall-related injuries, as the relative number of overall fall-related attendance continued to increase despite a shrinking child and adolescent population. the study suggests that fall-preventive measures for children and adolescents, such as installing soft rubber and waterproof floor in playgrounds and creating a safe home environment, should be implemented by schools and parents, respectively."
pmc3335463,"the human genome contains viral and bacterial double-stranded dna, as well as human dna, due to homology between viral and human proteins. this homology allows viruses to subvert human protein networks, promoting disease by either interfering with their human counterparts or by occupying and blocking them, resulting in increased levels of the corresponding ligands. the human genome also contains multiple homologous viral proteins to both viral and human proteomes. these homologous proteins can be targeted by autoantibodies, resulting in autoimmune-related attack of diverse compartments, including oligodendrocyte cell loss, impaired synaptic connectivity, and pyramidal cell dendrite shrinkage, as seen in schizophrenia. the human genome is also subject to phage or viral infection, as many viruses have been found to bind to human proteins with homology to their viral risk factors. infection and genetics therefore appear to be interdependent, as the genes promote disease if the homologous pathogen is encountered, targeting many relevant proteins at once. pathogens may promote disease if the human genes encode for proteins with homology to the viral risk factors, but on a massive scale, targeting many relevant proteins at once. viral interference with these same proteins might be expected to promote the same effects in schizophrenia and other conditions, but on a massive scale, targeting many relevant proteins at once. pathogen detection and elimination or vaccination, particularly prior to pregnancy, might reduce the incidence of schizophrenia and other conditions, as well as improve the armoury and safety of drugs against parasites such as toxoplasma gondii and borrelia, and related autoimmune diseases caused by pathogens but dependent on our genes. autoimmunity, involving several key schizophrenia-related proteins, may well be a consequence of pathogen infection, and related to viral/human protein homology."

pmc5872002,"in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, pupillometry has been shown to be a valuable tool for the early detection and monitoring of diseases such as parkinson's, alzheimer's, and glaucoma. this is because the pupillary light reflex  plr  is a quantitative, non-invasive measure of autonomic nervous system function that is altered in these conditions. for example, in parkinson's disease, the plr is attenuated due to decreased sympathetic nervous system activity, while in alzheimer's disease, it is reduced due to decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity. additionally, in glaucoma, the plr is attenuated due to optic nerve damage, and dynamic pupillometry has been used to monitor the progression of the disease and the response to treatment. in the context of drug and alcohol misuse, pupillometry has been shown to be a sensitive index of exposure and has been used to detect and monitor the effects of toxins and toxic chemicals such as organophosphates, botulinum toxin, and bacterial biothreat agents. for example, botulinum toxin, a nerve agent, causes miosis  constricted pupils  due to decreased cholinergic signaling, and pupillometry has been used to monitor the effects of the toxin in animal models. similarly, exposure to organophosphates, a family of chemicals including nerve agents and pesticides, causes dose-dependent miosis and attenuation of the plr, which is attributed to desensitization of muscarinic receptors within retinal tissue following prolonged exposure. in the context of infection and inflammation, pupillometry has been shown to offer the potential to detect systemic changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic system function in response to infection and inflammation. this is because the brain monitors and modulates immune status through both humoral and neural pathways, and changes to cholinergic signaling are likely to influence the plr both directly and indirectly. for example, in response to infection, signals from the vagus afferent fibers eventually project to the locus coeruleus region of the brain, and measurement of the plr using dynamic pupillometry may offer the potential to detect systemic changes in"

pmc2806771,"the structure-activity relationship of small-molecule inhibitors targeting viral fusion proteins reveals that binding of high affinity compounds, such as tmc353121, involves the formation of a distorted 6-helix bundle, with the compound sandwiched between hr1 and hr2 at the end of the 6-helix distal to where the two fusing membranes are brought together. this binding mode disrupts the natural closing of the zipper process required for stable pore formation, which may prevent the formation of a fusion-competent conformation of the fusion protein and/or alter the timing of 6-helix bundle formation required for stable pore formation. the current model of paramyxoviral fusion predicts that the viral membrane is brought close to the host cell membrane by refolding of the fusion protein from a “prehairpin” to a “hairpin” conformation. in agreement with this model, the observed distorted 6-helix bundle in the presence of bound tmc353121 may disrupt the timing of 6-helix bundle formation required for stable pore formation. the binding mode of tmc353121 explains the selection of the d486n resistance mutation, as the sidechain of d486 forms a hydrogen bond with tmc353121 and an additional intramolecular hydrogen bond, d486n likely destabilizes the interaction with tmc353121, consistent with the reduction in susceptibility observed for the d486n mutant virus. resistance mutations in fusion protein regions distinct from the binding site of fusion inhibitors have previously been described in rsv, measles virus, arenavirus, and influenza a viruses, as well as in other viruses, and alter the stability of the fusion protein to reestablish optimal viral fusion kinetics. the observed binding mode of tmc353121 does not explain the k394r and s398l mutations in the globular loop region. however, resistance mutations in fusion protein regions distinct from the binding site of fusion inhibitors have previously been described in rsv  24, 28 , as well as in other viruses"
pmc5923485,"the current study focused on kinases in the translation pathway as a leverage point to fight rvfv due to the robust phosphorylation of key players in translation observed in rvfv infected cells. inhibition of translation through kinase inhibitors, such as rapamycin, can be a safe and effective antiviral strategy, as demonstrated by the current study's use of rapamycin to suppress rvfv replication. the study's analysis of rvfv-infected cells revealed that rvfv hijacks the translation pathway to facilitate its replication, and inhibition of translation, through kinase inhibitors, allows for a more robust viral inhibition. the study's findings suggest that targeting multiple key kinases within the translational pathway, such as the combined use of inhibitors to suppress viral replication, allows for the most robust viral inhibition. the study's use of host-based therapeutics, such as kinase inhibitors, to fight rvfv infection, is a current strategy being explored due to the importance of the translational pathway in many cellular events, including cell cycle regulation, cell survival, transcription, and innate immune responses."
pmc1421410,"the study reports an efficient, specific, and sensitive assay for detecting h5n1 influenza virus isolates, with a lower limit of detection in the picogram range, equivalent to 1 × 103 copies, and a wide variety of h5n1 influenza virus isolates from archived samples from both humans and avian sources were successfully detected. the assay's design allows for accurate and specific detection of viral rna, with a lower risk of cross-contamination due to its one-step single-tube reaction, and the results suggest that the primers are specific for h5n1, making it useful for the early detection and monitoring of avian influenza outbreaks. the study highlights the strong influence of sample type on viral rna detection accuracy and sensitivity, and the rapid one-step single-tube reaction, with a lower limit of detection, can be a cost-effective, gel-based system, especially in regions where real-time pcr platforms and equipment may not be available. the results of the study strongly suggest that the primers are specific for h5n1, which can be very useful for the early detection and monitoring of avian influenza outbreaks. the study underscores the need for more known h5n1 influenza virus isolates from archived samples from humans, as the availability of human samples is difficult due to the low number of human infections at this point. however, the results strongly suggest that the primers are specific for h5n1, which can be very useful for the early detection and monitoring of avian influenza outbreaks."
pmc6157109,"in a review of 70 studies on human bocavirus  hbov  published between 2005 and 2016, the majority  66  reported on hbov prevalence in detection, with a low heterogeneity among the studies. the prevalence of hbov in children less than 5 years of age was higher than in older children and adults. hbov1 was detected in all studies, and the highest prevalence  13%  was observed in individuals suffering from diarrhea with and without respiratory tract infection in africa. the review revealed that most studies focused on hbov in respiratory tract infection, with a prevalence rate of 78% in individuals suffering from respiratory tract infection being higher than the rate  21%  in individuals suffering from gastroenteritis. this could be due to the fact that most studies focused on hbov in respiratory tract infection since its discovery in 2005. the review also found that the prevalence of hbov in children less than 5 years of age was higher than in older children and adults, indicating that these children may act as reservoir for other emerging epidemic hbov strains. the review highlighted that while studies in africa were mostly done in urban settings, this could be due to the lack of laboratory resource capacity and technology for hbov detection in rural settings. therefore, more studies are required in africa, especially in rural settings, to monitor the prevalence of hbov and help understand the role of hbov in individuals suffering from gastroenteritis with/without respiratory tract infection. the review also suggested that the high frequency of hbov in children raises a potential health risk, as these children may act as reservoir for other emerging epidemic hbov strains. this underscores the need for increased awareness and surveillance of hbov infections, particularly in children in africa, where the virus is likely to be underreported due to the costs of testing for the virus."
pmc4569561,"in both epidemics of h7n9 in guangdong province, exposure to live poultry was common in both urban and rural areas. however, during the winter 2013-14 epidemic, exposure to live poultry declined in urban residents, likely due to the h7n9 epidemic. a minority of urban respondents  around one-third  supported permanent closure of live poultry markets  lpms  in both surveys, despite the higher level of worries and perceived risk of infection during the second survey. contact with live poultry was regarded as a possible route of h7n9 transmission by most rural respondents, but there was no apparent reduction in backyard poultry exposure reported by them. the higher level of worries and perceived risk of infection during the second survey did not necessarily result in a change in raising backyard poultry in rural areas, implying that decision-making on raising backyard poultry may not be driven by these factors. the authors suggest that further efforts are needed to protect public health if h7n9 re-emerges in a third epidemic in the winter of 2014-15."

pmc1316033,"the study demonstrated that the sars-cov plpro, a viral polyprotein processing enzyme, can deubiquitinate substrates, thereby protecting proteins from degradation by the proteasome. this is important because deubiquitination is a widespread mechanism used by cells to target proteins for degradation by the proteasome, and the sars-cov plpro may increase the stability and steady-state level of host and/or viral proteins. the study also showed that the sars-cov plpro can disassemble branched polyubiquitin chains, which are involved in protein targeting for degradation by the proteasome. this is significant because it implies that the sars-cov plpro may de-isgylate protein conjugates, as isoglutamine and isoglutamine-vinyl sulfone share the same c-terminal sequence. the study found that the sars-cov plpro is inhibited by the specific deubiquitinating enzyme inhibitor ubal, with a ki value of 210 nm. this is important because it establishes that the deubiquitinating activity of sars-cov plpro is regulated, which can lead to an additional level of functional complexity to this enzyme and elevate its value as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. the study identified substrates from cells infected by the sars-cov virus, which confirms that deubiquitination is operative in the context of a sars-cov infection. this is significant because it provides insights into processes taking place at the molecular level during viral infection, which can improve our understanding of how to treat sars and related viruses. the study showed that the sars-cov plpro, which is located in nsp3, the replicase complex, could also deubiquitinate host or viral proteins. this is important because it adds an additional level of functional complexity to this enzyme and highlights the need for continued investigation of sars-cov plpro functions to improve our understanding of processes taking place at the molecular level during viral infection."

pmc3648152,"the study demonstrates that a broad panel of human cell lines is susceptible to hcov-emc entry mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein emc-s, including cells derived from the colon, liver, kidney, and lung. the study reveals that hcov-emc uses a novel receptor for cellular entry, and it defines host cell enzymes important for activation of emc-s, which might constitute targets for intervention. the study shows that hcov-emc, like sars-cov, can be activated by endosomal cathepsins and type ii transmembrane serine proteases in cell culture, suggesting that the activities of both proteases must be blocked in patients in order to efficiently suppress viral replication. the study identifies pseudotypes as a valuable tool for the detection of neutralizing antibodies directed against emc-s, a finding that has important implications for diagnostic approaches and efforts to characterize the humoral immune response in hcov-emc-infected patients. the study shows that serum from an hcov-emc-infected patient contains neutralizing antibodies specific for emc-s but not for vsv-g or sars-s, indicating that this tool might prove useful in determining the frequency of hcov-emc infection in patients and the potential cross-reactivity of serum with other coronavirus s proteins."

pmc136196,"the study found that the human rotavirus, tgev, has a second binding activity in addition to binding to the primary receptor, aminopeptidase n. this second binding activity is mediated by a sialic acid binding activity. the study demonstrated that the sialic acid binding activity of tgev is required for efficient virus replication in the intestinal epithelium, as mutants lacking this activity have lost their enteropathogenicity. the study found that the binding of tgev to sialoglycoproteins increases the amount of bound virus, but it does not increase infectivity. the study found that the presence of a sialic acid binding activity in tgev may help the virus get access to the target cells in the intestine by allowing it to stay longer in the intestine and make it easier to find the aminopeptidase n receptor for initiating infection. the study found that the resistance of tgev to inactivation by detergent was only slightly increased compared to that of mutants lacking sialic acid binding activity, suggesting that the importance of this binding activity may be to help the virus get access to the target cells rather than to protect it from inactivation by low ph and protease."
pmc3539574,"a study conducted in 4 provinces of china during the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic found that 2% of university students met symptomatic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder  ptsd . the study identified significant predictors of ptsd symptoms, including being from north china, being a female, having h1n1 influenza, having family members, friends, or acquaintances with h1n1 influenza, and being afraid of h1n1 influenza. university students in north china with higher grade had more ptsd symptoms, contrary to previous predictions. the study highlights the need for organizations to develop an integrated administrative and psychosocial response to the psychological challenges caused by future outbreaks of this nature. the study contributes to understanding ptsd symptoms and significant predictors among university students involved in h1n1 influenza outbreaks, which can be useful in defining the high-risk group of university students in similar influenza epidemics."

pmc5880402,"the study found that xenosurveillance, using blood-fed mosquitoes as sampling method, is a viable alternative for collecting human blood samples used in pathogen surveillance, with substantially fewer losses of reads compared to traditional sampling methods. the study identified genetic signatures of two viruses, gbv-c and hbv, using bioinformatics and molecular methods, respectively, from individual dbs. the study showed that xenosurveillance is less invasive and logistically challenging compared to traditional sampling methods, as mosquitoes constantly take blood meals from humans, especially in the tropics, and sample storage is simple and cost effective. the study highlighted the potential for routine xenosurveillance to provide early warnings by detecting emerging pathogens circulating at low levels in vulnerable populations. the study indicated that zoonotic, viral pathogens are disproportionately likely to reach pandemic emergence, as compared to parasites or bacteria, and recent pandemics of zoonotic viruses support this notion."
pmc3163856,"in the context of the weight guidelines for global health training programs, one major drawback is the difficulty in measuring the performance of training programs due to the numerous competing factors that shape the pursuit of higher education and careers in global health. however, as a result of the course, one u.s. faculty member received funding for a terminal degree at a partnering u.s. institution. in the context of the course's mosquito control activities, mosquito surveillance equipment such as light traps were donated by course faculty to the st. catherine health department where officers have since reported that mosquito trapping and species identification, skills acquired in this course, have become an integral part of health department mosquito control and public education efforts. in the context of student evaluations, benefits and risks are spread as evenly as possible among all institutions. for example, at u.s. institutions, students who participate in human research projects submit their protocols to the u.s. institutional review board and the uwi/uhwi ethics committee in jamaica for approval. in the context of course content and pedagogy, as teams increasingly visited local communities to conduct surveys, there was an opportunity to use a classic participatory approach. beginning in 2006, a concerted effort was made to introduce didactic material on community-based, participatory approaches, and mandating that all groups focus on community participation. in the context of student evaluations, conclusions analyses of quantitative and qualitative student evaluations have motivated the course to refine content and pedagogy over the years. the course fills a gap in training regarding global-health needs, approaches and experiences, and has become a core offering that often solidifies student commitments to global health careers. despite some challenges, the myriad rewards from this course validate the benefits of cross-disciplinary and cross-national collaborations, and confirm the value of partnerships derived from and cemented by these joint endeavors."

pmc4317630,"ace2 is a critical enzyme for counteracting the renin-angiotensin system  ras  and maintaining a balance between the ace-angiotensin ii-at1 receptor axis and the ace2-angiotensin 1-7-mas receptor axis. dysregulation of this balance is associated with various diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and iga nephropathy. ace2 is downregulated in hypertensive nephropathy, hypertensive cardiopathy, and subtotal nephrectomy, which might exacerbate the deleterious effects of angiotensin ii on the kidneys. ace2 activity is upregulated in diabetic nephropathy, and its urinary protein level and activity are useful biomarkers for this condition. ace2 ectodomain shedding is partially dependent on tumor necrosis factor-alpha convertase  adam17 , which is responsible for increased ectodomain shedding of ace2 at least in vitro, and patients with renal disease exhibit increased expression levels of adam17. ace2 activators, such as human recombinant ace2  hrace2 , might represent a new therapeutic strategy for angiotensin ii overactivity, but the suggestion that ace2 activators have supra therapeutic effects on kidney disease than classical ras inhibitors is speculative at present, as enhancing ace2 activity might represent a new therapeutic strategy for angiotensin ii overactivity, but the short-term administration of ace2 inhibitors, such as xanthenone  xnt  and diminazene  dize , did not affect renal or cardiac ace2 activity in vitro and ex vivo experiments in both mice and rat kidney."
pmc4008647,"the study found that inhibition of the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in primary cultures of human leiomyoma cells decreased cell growth and proliferation in vitro, suggesting a critical role for this pathway in stem cell renewal and differentiation to the smooth-muscle phenotype observed in myometrial and leiomyoma tissues. the study revealed that components of the wnt pathway, such as frizzled receptors, are prime drug development targets, particularly the accessible plasma membrane receptors, as both canonical and noncanonical wnts may contribute to tumorigenesis. the study showed that expression of wnt4, an activator of β-catenin, is markedly elevated in leiomyoma with med12 mutations compared to those without mutations, indicating a mechanism involving med12 mutations and wnt/β-catenin activation that supports cell proliferation in uterine leiomyoma tissue. the study demonstrated that niclosamide and xav939, both of which inhibit wnt/β-catenin signaling, have antitumor effects on primary cultures of human leiomyoma cells in vitro, highlighting the down-regulation of wnt/β-catenin signaling as a potential target for new therapeutics in the treatment of uterine leiomyomas. the study suggests that cells serving as progenitors to leiomyoma may be a key target of wnt/β-catenin signaling in leiomyoma tumorigenesis, as wnt/β-catenin signaling controls cell-fate decisions throughout development, often controlling the balance between progenitor cells and their descendants."

pmc5473744,"the authors have developed a database, called the integrated sequence variant database  isvdb , that stores imputed probabilistic variant state for cc strains and founder strains. this resource is a useful complement to sequencing data and allows the rapid generation of probabilistic variant states for f1 populations. the isvdb includes predicted functional consequences of variant alleles, as well as allele calls themselves. this resource is easily accessible at http //isvdb.unc.edu. the authors note that, in the generations since the mrcas, additional mutations have accumulated and rapidly become fixed due to the extremely small effective population size within each cc strain. the authors plan to incorporate three other males per strain from the sequencing generation, to better integrate sequence and same-generation mgp genotyping data, as well as to estimate genotype uncertainty and residual heterozygosity. the authors also plan to update the isvdb with more accurate state and incorporate the newest high-resolution data to allow a useful comparison between generations, as well as to detect loci that have become fixed since the mrcas and to investigate possible selective advantages of the newly fixed alleles."
pmc1305130,"in a study on the conformational space of the transmembrane domain of coronavirus protein e, a dimeric, a trimeric, and two pentameric homooligomers have been conserved in all 13 sequences analyzed, indicating that these models have been conserved by chance. this is supported by the low similarity between these sequences, as low as 17%, and by the relative energies of the resulting models, as the lowest energy models for each sequence cluster around the conformation of the persistent model. a systematic search for homooligomers of coronavirus protein e has revealed that dimeric, trimeric, and pentameric homooligomers can form in sds micelles. this is consistent with previous in vivo studies that showed dimers and trimers in nonreducing conditions, but only monomers in reducing conditions. the study suggests that the specificity in the interactions between monomers resides in the transmembrane domain of protein e, but a dramatic effect on oligomerization is contributed by the extramembrane domain, specifically, but possibly not limited to, intermonomer disulfide bonds. the predicted pentameric bundle or pore could represent open and closed states of a channel, as both conformations should have been equally conserved during evolution. this is intriguing as recent in vivo studies on the whole protein have shown membrane permeabilizing activity of scove, and the reported membrane permeabilizing activity of scove is consistent with the prediction of a pentameric bundle or pore. the study supports a topology for protein e where n- and c-termini are in opposite sides of the membrane, as both n- and c-termini of the protein would reside in the inside of the virion envelope. this is consistent with previous studies that showed that protein e was not digested after treating mhv particles with proteinase k in the absence of detergent and that protein e was palmitoylated, as physical interaction of this domain with the m protein is critical in the formation of the virion. the study proposes that palmitoylation and the subsequent close association of the cytoplasmic tail to the lipid bilayer may trigger conformational changes critical for function, as"

pmc6681324,"a study conducted in sierra leone found that ebola survivors who use traditional and complementary medicine  t&cm  believe that these medicines boost their immune system. this is similar to findings in hiv/aids patients and individuals with musculoskeletal conditions in other contexts. the study also showed that ebola survivors who use t&cm are highly likely to be driven by belief in the notion that t&cm is more natural than conventional medicine. this is similar to findings in cancer survivors and pregnant women in other contexts. the study found that ebola survivors who use t&cm want more control over their health. this is in line with insights from the current post-infectious sequelae literature in other contexts, including those among survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  in hong kong. the study revealed that ebola survivors who are t&cm users and non-users in sierra leone agreed that medical doctors should be able to advise their patients about t&cm. this is in contrast to some studies in other conditions and in other countries. the study limitations include that the data collected is self-reported, which may reflect recall bias, and that the findings are not necessarily representative of the perceptions and experiences of ebola survivors in other countries, as the study excluded survivors with conditions that limit their ability to accurately provide information or participate in the study and may put the research and other participants at risk."
pmc3253127,"wild dogs with greater opportunities for contact with domestic dogs were at greater risk of exposure to canine parvovirus, ehrlichia, and neospora, but not for canine distemper virus or canine coronavirus. exposure to canine parvovirus, ehrlichia, and neospora was associated with small pack size, rather than large pack size as would be expected if high intra-pack contact increased exposure. exposure to coronavirus declined significantly over time, and similar patterns  albeit non-significant  were observed for all of the viral pathogens considered here. the balance between positive and negative effects of exposure to these pathogens is likely to vary between pathogens, suggesting that a single management strategy  e.g., domestic dog removal  might not be appropriate for all pathogens. this study is one of a very small number of empirical attempts to quantify rates of contact between wild and domestic mammals and to successfully link individual variation in hosts' opportunities for interspecific contact to variation in pathogen exposure. further studies of this kind are needed to address the growing number of wild species threatened by infectious disease."

pmc3674685,"the present study demonstrated the feasibility of using lactococcus lactis as a vaccine delivery vehicle for displaying the m2 protein, a highly conserved and nonglycosylated antigen from the influenza virus, for cross-subtype protection against avian influenza. the study found that most of the vaccinated chickens developed a significant m2e-specific serum igg response, and birds vaccinated intranasally with lactococcus lactis-m2e or vaccinated subcutaneously with m2e conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin survived infectious challenge longer than nonvaccinated birds. the study also found that birds vaccinated subcutaneously with m2e conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin had a lower mean viral burden than either of the other two groups, and an analysis of the data suggested that protection may be due to m2e-specific serum igg. the study noted that the lack of robust m2e-specific fecal igg or cd4+ t lymphocyte response could be due to differential processing of antigen by the immune system and further exploration is needed to understand this finding. the study suggested that l. lactis-m2e induced mainly a humoral response, but less significant cellular response, and further research is needed to determine whether this is a reflection of the lower amount of virus in tracheal swabs in birds vaccinated with lactococcus lactis-m2e compared to nonvaccinated birds."
pmc4365254,"the study developed a novel ica for the qualitative detection of mers-cov antigen in dromedary camels, which was found to be rapid, sensitive, specific, and stable at room temperature. the assay developed here is considered satisfactory to be used for herd screening against mers-cov antigen across international borders, animal markets, and slaughterhouses, followed by a confirmatory test for positive samples. the sensitivities and specificities of the oie-certified serological diagnostic kits are comparable to those of the ica, indicating its high precision and throughput. the study suggests that the assay developed here might assist governmental entities in the rapid diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of mers-cov infection in dromedary camels due to its high specificity compared to that of the uprer real-time rt-pcr, and its high repeatability and reproducibility. the detection limit of the ica on the nucleocapsid protein was 1.5 ng/ml, which suggests that the assay might be applicable to the medical field for human samples or samples containing other mers-cov-related viruses due to its targeting of the conserved region of the virus."

pmc1951058,"the study showed that vaccination with the sars-cov s-protein dna vaccine, when coadministered with an il-2-expressing plasmid, resulted in enhanced immune responses, including increased antigen-specific proliferative responses, higher levels of interferon-γ  ifn-γ  production, and increased cd8+ t cell numbers, compared to those in mice given the antigen-encoding plasmid alone. the study also found that the administration of il-2, as an adjuvant, augmented viral antigen-specific th1 immune responses and improved clinical outcomes in animal models of chronic viral infection. the study demonstrated that immunization by the intramuscular  i.m.  route, electroporation, and orally by using live attenuated salmonella typhimurium, when administering the sars-cov s-protein dna vaccine, induced distinct immune response profiles. immunization by the i.m. route and electroporation induced moderate t cell responses but vigorous antibody responses, while oral immunization induced vigorous t cell-mediated immune responses but weak antibody production predominantly of the igg2a subclass. the study suggested that different formulations of the same plasmid dna vaccine could induce distinct immune responses, which may be due to the different ways of antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells when it is delivered by different routes, or the different amounts of dna used for the different routes. the study highlighted that the effects of dna vaccination in mice may be more dramatic than those in humans, and further refinements of the immunization conditions, especially the dna immune dose, are required to ensure the maximal expansion of sars-cov s-protein dna vaccine effectors in humans."
pmc6593266,"this study found that neither metronidazole nor probiotics significantly improved the time to resolution of acute diarrhea in dogs compared to placebo. the study identified that dogs with a previous history of diarrhea, dietary indiscretion, or fluid administration had a longer time to resolution of diarrhea compared to dogs without these factors. the study found that 33% of fecal samples tested positive for the netf encoding gene for clostridium perfringens, which is largely consistent with previous reports but higher than expected. the study revealed that the time to resolution of diarrhea in dogs administered a probiotic was similar to another probiotic study with more severe hemorrhagic diarrhea, but this may be partially due to a longer duration of clinical signs before enrollment and differences in etiology and time of presentation. the study demonstrated that the degraded probiotic product should likely not be considered equivalent to placebo due to the lack of normal preservation techniques used in the commercial version of this product, which was likely due to the inadvertent lack of normal preservation techniques used in the commercial version of this product."
pmc5052842,"the study reports a significant number of contamination incidents during the removal of personal protective equipment  ppe , with 65 incidents occurring during the overall doffing process, equating to 2.2 incidents per participant. the most vulnerable process for contamination was the removal of respirators, with 79.3% of incidents occurring during this step. the study highlights the need for healthcare workers to be cautious about decontamination and optimize ppe handling procedures for specific clinical situations, with more training and technical support required. the study suggests that intensive and repetitive training is required for safe doffing, with potential measures including interactive audiovisual devices and trained personnel specialized in assisting with the procedures. the study shows that more intensive education and training are required for safe decontamination, as despite hand washing, healthcare workers could touch other parts of their bodies or clothing that has not been properly decontaminated and consequently infect themselves."
pmc4609528,"in the context of virus transmission, one of the most important findings is the discovery that there are currently 32,000 new viruses waiting to infect animals, and the basic reproduction number ℛ for these viruses is greater than 1 [1]. this finding highlights the urgent need for further research and prevention measures to combat the spread of these viruses. in the context of virus-free equilibrium, another significant finding is the confirmation that the equilibrium state e 0 is locally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number ℛ is less than or equal to 1 [3]. this finding has important implications for the design and implementation of control measures in epidemic situations. in the context of virus transmission, a third significant finding is the identification of two distinct virus strains, namely strain a with a basic reproduction number ℛ of 1.125 and strain b with a basic reproduction number ℛ of 1.5 [5]. this finding suggests the need for further research to understand the differences between these strains and to develop more targeted prevention measures. in the context of virus-free equilibrium, a fourth significant finding is the demonstration that the equilibrium state e 1 is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number ℛ is greater than 1 [4]. this finding has important implications for the design and implementation of control measures in epidemic situations. in the context of virus transmission, a fifth significant finding is the determination that the virus strain a has a basic reproduction number ℛ of 1.125 and that the virus strain b has a basic reproduction number ℛ of 1.5 [6]. this finding highlights the need for further research to understand the factors influencing the basic reproduction number ℛ and to develop more effective prevention measures."

pmc5405858,"chronic viral infections with long transmission intervals require mechanisms to avoid or reduce short-sighted evolution, as the potential for short-sighted evolution is a secret of viral success but can limit the capacity for short-sighted evolution. this is because viruses with long transmission intervals can only persist in a host population if viral populations that have undergone little short-sighted evolution remain available for onward transmission. for some viruses, such as human t-lymphotropic virus type 1  htlv-1 , human t-lymphotropic virus type 2  htlv-2 , and hepatitis b virus  hbv , fast rates of within-host evolution are balanced by the transmission of less-evolved virus, rather than a process of adaptation and reversion, as the primary mechanism leading to a mismatch in evolutionary rates between within- and among-host levels. evidence for this argument is available for six of the eight chronic rna viruses  including dna viruses with rna intermediates  that are known to be prevalent in humans; less is known about the natural history and evolution of the other two viruses, human pegiviruses 1 and 2  hpgv-1 and hpgcv-2 , or for chronic rna viruses infecting other animals. the ability of viruses to evolve rapidly is one of the secrets of their success, allowing them to evade host immune responses, evolve novel functions, and explore new niches. however, this genetic plasticity may, for a virus, represent a double-edged sword that needs to be controlled. indeed, it could be that overcoming short-sighted evolution is a necessary condition for the success of some viruses. for a virus to be maintained in a host population, mechanisms for maintaining proposed germline lineages in viral populations could themselves be under selection. evidence for this argument is available for six of the eight chronic rna viruses  including dna viruses with rna intermediates  that are known to be prevalent in humans; less is known about the natural history and evolution of the other two viruses, human pegiviruses 1 and 2  hpgv-1 and hpgcv-2 , or for chronic rna viruses infect"
pmc1616946,"antisense oligonucleotides can induce high-level frameshifting, with az1a, which anneals directly adjacent to the uga stop codon, being able to induce ribosome frameshifts to either the +1 or −1 reading frame. the ability of antisense oligonucleotides to induce frameshifting is not dependent on the presence of elaborate tertiary structures, as structural studies indicate that antisense–mrna duplexes formed by complementary antisense oligonucleotides are sufficient to induce high-level frameshifting. the ability of spermidine to stimulate antisense oligonucleotide induced ribosome frameshifting to the +1 reading frame at the ucc uga shift site in the absence of the natural 3′ stimulator demonstrates that this cis-acting element is not required for polyamine responsiveness. the observation that az1a, which anneals directly adjacent to the uga stop codon, can induce ribosome frameshifts to either the +1 or −1 reading frame is surprising, as visual examination of upstream codons does not reveal an obvious −1 or +1 frameshift site. the ability to direct ribosomes to the +1 reading frame in living cells suggests a potential therapeutic application for antisense oligonucleotides, as directed frameshifting to the +1 reading frame near a disease causing −1 frameshift mutation would cause some ribosomes to resume decoding in the wild-type orf, thus restoring partial production of full-length protein from mutant alleles."

pmc5591469,"among the healthy puppies screened, 80% were found positive for c. difficile, and 10% were positive for c. pervidens. among the affected puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea, all were positive for c. difficile, 90.3% were positive for c. pervidens, 17.7% were positive for cpe, 16.7% were positive for cpa toxin, 15.6% were positive for e. coli stec, 15.6% were positive for e. coli lt, and 10.8% were positive for c. pervidens stec. among the puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea, c. difficile was identified as a common enteropathogen, and its role in pathogenesis is not clearly understood. c. pervidens and c. difficile toxin b, enteric ccov, and rotavirus were found negative in all 62 puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea screened. among the diarrheic puppies, a higher prevalence of c. difficile was evident in the locality, and effective vaccination programs, client education, and disinfection strategies will help in reducing the incidence. cefotaxime was found useful against few gram-positive and most of the gram-negative microbes implicated in parvoviral enteritis, and gentamicin was found to have the maximum sensitivity pattern against the enteropathogens implicated in severe hemorrhagic diarrhea."
pmc4301123,"swine ifitms, including swifitm1 to -5, are upregulated by type i interferon and influenza virus infection in porcine cells. swine ifitms, such as swifitm1a and -1b, display plasma membrane localization, while swine ifitm2 and -3 are found to colocalize with a marker for late endosomes. overexpression of swine ifitms results in reduced influenza virus reporter activity and reduced viral titers, with swifitm2 and swifitm3 displaying the strongest antiviral activities. endogenous swine ifitms also contribute to the antiviral activity of type i interferon in porcine cells. further studies can examine the antiviral potential of swine ifitms from different swine breeds to identify pig breeds with increased resistance to influenza virus infections."
pmc5718803,"a vaccine containing a fusion protein composed of the ecmx antigen from mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv and the cm7 antigen from m. tuberculosis cfp1027 was found to provide protection against m. tuberculosis in mice. the vaccine was also found to be effective in preventing dissemination of the bacteria to the lungs and spleen of mice. the vaccine was shown to significantly reduce the bacterial load in the lungs of mice four weeks after challenge with m. tuberculosis. the vaccine was found to elicit a strong immune response to the ecmx antigen, which is a key antigen in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. the vaccine was also shown to be effective in preventing the dissemination of m. tuberculosis to the draining lymph nodes of mice. bacterial load in the lungs of mice was significantly reduced by the vaccine four weeks after challenge with m. tuberculosis. the vaccine was found to elicit a strong immune response to the cm7 antigen, which is also a key antigen in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. the vaccine was shown to provide protection against m. tuberculosis in mice, and this protection was found to be as effective as that provided by the bcg vaccine, which is currently used to prevent tuberculosis in humans. the vaccine was also found to be as effective as the bcg vaccine in preventing dissemination of m. tuberculosis to the lungs and spleen of mice. the vaccine was shown to significantly reduce the bacterial load in the lungs of mice four weeks after challenge with m. tuberculosis, which was comparable to the reduction observed in mice vaccinated with the bcg vaccine. the vaccine was found to elicit a strong immune response to the ecmx antigen in mice, which was comparable to the response observed in mice vaccinated with the bcg vaccine. the vaccine was also shown to elicit a strong immune response to the cm7 antigen in mice, which was comparable to the response observed in mice vaccinated with the bcg vaccine"
pmc4722224,"new infectious diseases pose a formidable threat to human lives due to the accelerated risks of exposure to hitherto unknown pathogens as a result of increased frequency and shortened time of travel. emergence of new pathogens and their interaction with hosts may result in high-mortality pandemic episodes due to the lack of immune system preparedness and response. changing environments may provide opportunities for new pathogenic mutants to rise and invade human hosts. early prevention and control failed in the recent mers outbreak due to a lack of rapid recognition and confirmation of infected cases, hesitation and delay in cooperation between hospitals and authorities, and failed implementation of authority and responsibility. failure in executing activities at the right place and time is not due to ignorance or lack of knowledge and skills, but rather unfaithful attitude and flat negligence, which has resulted in repeated disasters."
pmc2583688,"the crystal structure of recombinant niv-g, expressed in insect cells, reveals a monomeric form of the envelope protein, which is consistent with previous studies on hemagglutinins from other paramyxoviruses. the structure shows that the largest intermolecular interface in the niv-g crystal occludes only 600 å² of surface, inconsistent with oligomerization, but packing interactions of the β-propeller domains in the crystal structures of other paramyxoviruses demonstrate dimeric and tetrameric arrangements. the structure of recombinant niv-g shows significant structural divergence along the face formed by the propeller blades β2 to β4 and structural similarity on the opposing face, which is consistent with the suggestion that the surface of the β1 and β6 propeller blades forms the putative oligomerization face of niv-g. this face mediates dimerization of sv5, piv3, and ndv hemagglutin neuraminidases. the study reveals that over 2 kda of carbohydrate may be attached to individual glycosylation sites on niv-g, but analysis reveals that the low degree of glycosylation site conservation suggests that there are no conserved structural roles for individual glycans, although the small number of glycosylation sites within this region are located at the membrane-proximal and distal faces of the glycoprotein and are not anticipated to disrupt lateral interactions. the study suggests that the putative oligomerization face based on the alignment of sequences of the envelope glycoprotein from viruses across the paramyxovirus family maps the putative oligomerization face of niv-g, and the presentation of the oligomeric interface in a heterogenous vaccine may lead to antibody responses toward the nonneutralizing epitopes. the ""immunofocusing"" approach of pantophlet and burton  47 , in which additional n-linked glycosylation sites are added to nonneutralizing epitopes, could be used to generate a homogenous monomer that directs a neutralizing antibody response toward the ephrin binding"
pmc3698628,"according to a study by lyons and quinn  2010 , students in australia are less interested in science than their peers in developed countries. however, a study by goodrum et al.  2011  found that half of all students in australia, and particularly girls, are uncertain about whether they would like to study science in the future. a study by jenkins and nelson  2005  found that only 30% of students in the us would like to study science in the future, and this figure is similar to the results obtained in a study by lyons and quinn  2010  for students in australia. a study by masnick et al.  2010  found that students in the us do not well understand the role of creativity in science. the results of the current study, which involved students attending programs outside of school, indicate that students who participate in science outreach programs have a greater understanding of science and are more positive about science than the average student. however, more longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether better understanding of science practice translates into students choosing careers in science."
pmc5630798,"the areas of ppe most marked with paint were the lower shoulders and upper arms of surgical gowns, the top sides of papr shroud, the front upper chest area, and the center back of inner impermeable suits. in a majority of cases, no powder paint was noted on knee-high boots. in a minority of cases, paint was observed on the inside upper chest area of surgical gowns. paint markings were used to discuss potential breaches in ppe doffing technique in real-time. powdered paint can identify vulnerabilities in their process as well as areas that require further education."
pmc2762595,"the study reports the discovery that the main protease  mpro  of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  sars-cov  exists in both monomeric and a dimeric form in solution. the authors have solved the structures of both forms of mpro-c, which is the c-terminal domain of mpro, and found that the dimer structure is a 3d domain-swapped dimer. the dimer structure is stable and does not exchange with the monomer form, indicating that forming domain-swapped dimers is an intrinsic ability of mpro-c. the study also found that the n-finger of mpro may interfere and prevent the 3d domain-swapping dimerization of the c-terminal domain of mpro, suggesting that the full-length mpro may not form a domain-swapped dimer. the authors pose questions about why the virus retains the c-terminal domain within mpro, which has the potential to deactivate the enzyme, and whether the two n-terminal domains of the dimer would be far away and prevent the domain-swapped dimer from adopting the active conformation."
pmc6082671,"dna vaccination encoding cell membrane-targeting viral antigens led to the preferential production of igg-secreting hybridomas over igm-secreting hybridomas, as reported in a previous study. this suggests that proteins, as a vaccine type, may play a critical role in boosting the production of igg-secreting hybridomas in the dna vaccine platform. in the current study, vaccination with dna vaccines encoding cell membrane-associated viral antigens resulted in the successful generation of 12 polyclonal hybridomas secreting gp-specific igg types. among these, five were successfully sub-cloned to igg-producing single clones, and all of the five purified monoclonal igg antibodies recognized gp in an antigen-specific and igg dose-dependent manner, with three recognizing the native forms of gp expressed on the cell surface and remaining reactive to gp at the lowest tested concentrations ranging from 1.953 to 7.8 ng/ml. the five purified igg antibodies possess ebola virus gp-binding activity, but none of these antibodies can neutralize ebola virus, suggesting that none of these purified antibodies can block ebola virus infection. in the current study, it was observed that immune sera from animals immunized with gp dna vaccines were unable to recognize the denatured forms of gp by western blot assay. this is in line with the observation that the remaining five polyclonal hybridomas  e2, e8, e22, e31, and e60  appear to lose their ability to produce igg antibodies after continuous cell culture and passage, leading to a failure in making an igg producer. in the current study, it was found that the five purified gp-specific igg antibodies possess ebola virus gp-binding activity but not ebola virus neutralizing activity. among these, three recognized the native forms of gp expressed on the cell surface and remained reactive to gp at the lowest tested concentrations ranging from 1.953 to 7.8 ng/ml. however, these antibodies were unable to neutralize ebola"

pmc4015617,"the study found that the prevalence of febrile respiratory infections in the bolivian amazon region during the 2010-2012 period was high, with a predominance of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus a h1n1 pdm09. the study identified two distinct clusters of influenza a h1n1 pdm09 viruses, one in the bolivian amazon region and another in south america. the study also identified two distinct clusters of influenza b viruses, one in the bolivian amazon region and another in south america, with no evidence of recent viral introgression. the study found that the phylogeny of seasonal influenza a viruses in bolivia and south america was similar to that reported for other countries in the region. the study highlighted the need for continued monitoring of influenza viruses in the bolivian amazon region and the importance of strengthening laboratory diagnostic capacity in the region."
pmc4633014,"in this study, the authors investigated whether human viruses of distinct phylogenetic origins express common carbohydrate moieties. they used carbohydrate microarrays and elisa-based viral glycan-profiling analysis to characterize two broadly hiv-neutralizing agents, human monoclonal antibody 2g12 and lectin gna. the authors found that 2g12 is strictly specific for high-density man9 clusters that decorate the hiv envelope spike, whereas gna recognizes a number of n-glycan cryptic sugar moieties, including oligomannoses and previously unrecognized tri/m-gn-glyco-determinants. the authors noted that gna appears to be the potent natural ligand of gna and that molecular mechanisms underlying gna-model of ""pauci reactive"" glycan-binding and broad virus neutralization warrant further investigation. the authors mentioned that owing to the potential immunogenic activity as a plant-derived lectin, gna is unlikely suitable for anti-virus therapy in vivo, and effort must be made to establish gna-like potent and broadly virus-neutralizing antibodies, especially humanized or fully human mabs that are readily applicable in the front-line biodefense against emerging viral pathogens."

pmc3637501,"the study identified early changes in gene expression in patients treated with ipilimumab that may predict the incidence of later gi iraes. these changes include increased expression of neutrophil-activating cytokines such as il-8, increased expression of genes related to antibody production such as pseudomonas anti-i2 and saccharomyces cerevisiae, and increased expression of genes related to inflammation such as cxcl2 and cxcl3. the study found that high expression of the neutrophil-activating marker cd177 at week 3 was a very specific biomarker for grade 2+ gi iraes, as all patients who had no such event displayed expression levels below a certain threshold. the study also identified potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers such as increased expression of genes related to antibody production, increased expression of genes related to inflammation, and increased expression of genes related to neutrophil activation, which were present in patients who had later gi iraes. the study noted that the onset of gi iraes was associated with an increased number and expression of neutrophils, as well as increased expression of genes related to inflammation and antibody production. the study also highlighted the important role of neutrophils in the onset of gi iraes in these patients, as high expression of the neutrophil-activating marker cd177 at week 3 was a very specific biomarker for grade 2+ gi iraes, and increased expression of neutrophil-activating cytokines such as il-8 and increased expression of genes related to neutrophil activation were present in patients who had later gi iraes."
pmc2678614,"the authors present a model for estimating the reproductive number of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis  xdr tb  in south africa. they use a next generation approach to estimate the reproductive number of xdr tb, with equations describing nosocomial and community-based transmission. the model includes a probability of emergence and a probability of extinction, with the probability of extinction simplified if the number of secondary cases produced is poisson distributed. the model incorporates the possibility that individuals in a population have different transmission potential using moment-generating functions. the authors find that the waiting time for xdr tb patients to receive therapy is determined by a queueing system, where patients who become xdr tb suspects are put in a queue to test for drug resistance. the proportion of patients who enter a treatment program is the rate of entry multiplied by the minimum of either the entire demanding population or the fraction of the demanding population for which there is program capacity. the number admitted is ξmin y, b − n , where b is the number of program spaces  e.g., beds in a hospital ward , and n is the number of current occupants. the authors use a generalized form of the queueing system based on insights from queuing systems applied to housing shortages and vaccination programs. the authors estimate the probability of xdr tb epidemics in the context of different south african communities. they calculate the probability of emergence as 1 minus the probability of extinction, with the probability of extinction simplified if the number of secondary cases produced is poisson distributed. the probability of emergence is 1 minus the probability of extinction, which is calculated from the estimated value of r in the population, including the variance in the infectiousness among patients from in vivo air sampling studies to incorporate heterogeneity among individuals. the authors find that the probability of extinction simplifies to ploss = σj = 0,∞p ultimate extinction|j secondary cases produced  × p j secondary cases produced , where j is the number of secondary cases produced by a primary xdr tb case, and p ultimate extinction|j secondary cases produced  is the probability of ultimate extinction given that j secondary cases are produced, summed across all j  ploss = σj = 0,∞"

pmc4950590,"china has become the second largest healthcare market globally, but health inequality remains prevalent. healthcare investors in china are prioritizing capital preservation over long-term investments due to market crisis, potentially triggering or consolidating health inequality. four testing models reveal significant evidence of herding behavior among investors in all healthcare sectors in china, with the herding effect being more prominent during market downturns. the study suggests that herding behavior can lead to investor confidence loss, capital withdrawal, and delay in efforts to bridge healthcare access gaps across china. persistent herding tendencies among investors in china's healthcare market could result in more damaging consequences for health inequality, potentially including a potential healthcare market crash."
pmc2849606,"a study conducted in guatemala identified three specific biomarkers, fragments of host proteins, in the blood of individuals infected with the parasite trypanosoma cruzi, which causes chagas' disease  cd . these biomarkers, with molecular weights  m/z  of 6.3, 7.5, and 15.2 kda, have high specificity and sensitivity for cd, with more than 98% and 94%, respectively, making them useful for early cd diagnosis. the study also found that some of the most useful cd biomarkers, such as fragments of the host proteins fibronectin and complement protein c3, were generated as a result of the complex interactions between the parasite and the host. these findings suggest that t. cruzi may specifically target some of the host proteins implicated as cd biomarkers. the study discovered that cd is associated with the presence of unusually truncated forms of host proteins, including full-length fibronectin and complement protein c3, as well as several c3 derivatives, such as dimeric c3 and c3a desarg. these findings are intriguing, as they suggest that the interaction between t. cruzi and the host protein complement c3 could occur at several levels. the study also identified a 28.9 kda fragment of the host protein fibronectin as a cd biomarker. this fragment was found in the blood of individuals with cd, but not in those with other parasitic diseases, such as malaria or babesiosis. the study found that the majority of individuals with cd who succumbed to cardiac causes died from this complication, highlighting the need for further studies of lipid homeostasis in subjects infected with cd. the study also suggested that human adipocytes may serve as tissue reservoirs for t. cruzi."
pmc4509289,"the study found that the positive rate of bacterial detection using lamp assay was higher than that using conventional sputum culture in sputum specimens of aecopd patients. this suggests that lamp assay is a more sensitive and rapid method for detecting pathogenic bacteria in clinical sputum specimens of aecopd patients. the study also noted that conventional sputum culture has limitations, including a long test period, low positive rate, difficulty in detecting atypical bacterium, and susceptibility to contamination. lamp assay, on the other hand, has a shorter test period, a higher positive rate, and is less affected by mutations than other dna-based methods. the study highlighted that the sputum specimen is susceptible to contamination by upper airway liquid, and recommended using a modified cytology brush technique through a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope to collect sputum specimens in lower trachea. the study found discrepancies between lamp and sputum culture results, which can be attributed to the effect of sequence mutations on pathogenic bacterium. however, lamp assay was more consistent with the clinical symptoms of aecopd, as indicated by the fev1/fvc value, which suggests that lamp assay is a better clinical diagnostic tool for rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria in clinical sputum specimens of aecopd patients. the study also noted that the sputum culture results were less consistent with the clinical symptoms of aecopd, which indicates that lamp assay may be a more reliable method for detecting bacterial pathogens in sputum specimens of aecopd patients."
pmc5036914,"a retrospective analysis of respiratory viral infections  rvis  after hematopoietic stem cell transplant  hsct  found that universal surgical mask usage, which requires all individuals in inpatient and outpatient hsct facilities with direct patient contact to wear surgical masks regardless of symptoms or season, is associated with a significant decrease in clinically significant rvis, particularly piv3. the study also found that compliance with hand hygiene and contact and droplet isolation policies for symptomatic patients did not significantly impact the duration or severity of rvi outbreaks. the analysis showed that graft-versus-host disease  gvhd  and myeloablative conditioning were associated with more rvis, while myeloablative conditioning was associated with fewer rvis. the study found that rvis are most common in the spring and summer months, with a significant decrease in rvis observed in the mask period. the authors noted that differences in detection methods in the premask period  predominantly viral culture and dfa  versus the postmask period  pcr  could impact the results, with pcr being at least 30% more sensitive at detecting viral pathogens compared with dfa and culture, depending on the pathogen, without sacrificing specificity."
pmc5573743,"the study found that increased expression of the toll-like receptor  tlr  2 on circulating monocytes, as measured by flow cytometry, is a more sensitive predictor of coronary artery lesions  cals  in kawasaki disease  kd  than serum silicon  si -10, a biomarker previously proposed for this purpose. the study showed that increased expression of tlr2 on circulating monocytes before the initial treatment of kd patients is associated with increased risk of ivig  intravenous immunoglobulin  resistance, a complication commonly observed in kd patients. the study suggested that monitoring tlr2 expression, which requires relatively few steps, could potentially be used as a relatively easy-to-use biomarker in kd due to its early feasibility as a predictor of cardiovascular disease burden and severity. the study showed that ftlr2% before the initial treatment is a more sensitive predictor of cal development in kd than serum silicon  si -10 in kd patients. the study demonstrated that ftlr2% before the initial treatment could also predict ivig resistance with sensitivity comparable to that of serum silicon  si -10 in kd patients."
pmc109768,"prrsv gp3 protein is posttranslationally modified with complex-type glycosylation, resulting in a smear pattern with a molecular mass greater than that of the intracellular gp3. prrsv gp3 is released from the cell as a membrane-free form and acquires additional carbohydrate side chains in the medial golgi compartment. prrsv gp3 occurs in a disulfide-linked homodimer, which is selectively retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and is not detected in cell lysates but is revealed only in the culture fluids of infected cells. prrsv gp3 is released from infected cells through a vesicular transport pathway involving the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus, and this process is affected by inhibitors of protein transport and glycosylation. prrsv gp3 is released from infected cells at a rate that is dependent on its posttranslational modifications, and a small fraction of the nonglycosylated protein can be recovered in cells expressing gp3 in the presence of inhibitors of protein glycosylation."

pmc524836,"this study identified human cd209l  also known as l-sign  as a receptor for sars-cov, in addition to the previously identified ace2. cd209l is expressed on type ii alveolar cells and endothelial cells in human lung, which are important targets for sars-cov infection. cd209l is a less efficient receptor for sars-cov than ace2. the study used a strategy focused on sars-cov infection of human lung, which involved identifying human lung cdnas encoding cd209l, selecting cells that bound sars-cov s glycoprotein, and demonstrating virus infection using multiplex rt-pcr and immunofluorescence. the study found that all of the s-binding cho cells that were susceptible to virus entry contained cd209l cdna from the library, but did not identify any human cdnas encoding ace2 or dc-sign."
pmc4296132,"a study using search activity from uptodate, a healthcare database, and the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  data found that a dynamic multivariate methodology using search activity accurately predicts influenza activity in real-time, outperforming google flu trends  gft  estimates during the prediction period. the relevance of search terms in predicting influenza activity changes over time, with clinicians' tamiflu search activity being the strongest predictor, while sinusitis, influenza, h1n1, and coronavirus display relevance as predictors during different time periods. the success of the methodology suggests that low volumes of queries in subject-matter expert databases provide a promising way to identify meaningful signals to track influenza activity. the study's findings suggest that data from specialized databases, such as uptodate, may have an improved signal-to-noise ratio and be less likely to be impacted by public disruption resulting from anxiety or media reports during outbreaks of influenza. the study highlights the potential usefulness and limitations of digital data sources, such as search query data, for infectious disease surveillance."
pmc3701101,"the virome, or the collection of viruses in a microbial community, is a major component of the human microbiome, and its study is important for understanding human health and disease. virome analysis has revealed vast genomic diversity in the oceanic ecosystem and in the gut microbiome of healthy adults and infants, with the majority of viral sequences being novel. virome analysis has also shown that bacteriophages, which influence their host bacteria and contribute genes that affect the structure and functions of microbial communities, encode antibiotic resistance genes and other genes associated with bacterial metabolic pathways. virome analysis has identified novel eukaryotic viruses, such as astroviruses, caliciviruses, and parvoviruses, associated with diarrhea and respiratory illness, as well as known viruses in unexpected tissues. virome analysis has also shown that the presence of a disease, such as cystic fibrosis, can cause changes in the microbiome, including bacteriophage communities in healthy people that are unique to each individual and similar bacteriophage communities in individuals with cf that are thought to reflect effects of their airway pathology. the study of viral metagenomes in clinical samples may have potential applications as a diagnostic method, as sequence-based analysis of viral communities has shown sensitivity comparable to virus-specific polymerase chain reaction. virome analysis may also be informative for patient management, as it can reveal medically relevant viruses and genes detected, which can be further evaluated and confirmed using virus-specific assays, and genes encoded by viruses that may affect planned treatments or antibiotic or antiviral resistance."
pmc5890542,"fleximers, a new class of nucleoside analogues, were found to exhibit potent antiviral activity against a variety of viruses, including herpes simplex virus, hepatitis c, ebola, middle east respiratory syndrome, and zika viruses, due to their ability to sample more of the binding site and engage in secondary interactions with the enzymes, leading to selective inhibition. fleximers, by reversing the connectivity of the base and sugar moieties, were found to be recognized by both purine and pyrimidine metabolizing enzymes, leading to potential antiparasitic and anticancer activity. fleximers, by incorporating modified sugars found in fda-approved nucleoside therapeutics, were found to exhibit potent activity against human coronaviruses, dengue, and yellow fever viruses, highlighting the importance of understanding the selectivity of these unique nucleosides. fleximers, by utilizing an enzymatic transglycosylation approach, were found to prefer a co-planar arrangement, leading to their selectivity rather than indiscriminate activity. fleximers, by employing a wide range of substituted benzene rings instead of the typical ribose sugar, were found to exhibit excellent activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis, highlighting the potential of these unique nucleosides to target biologically significant enzymes."
pmc4655598,"a study comparing nasopharyngeal swabs and wash collection for respiratory virus detection using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  rt-pcr  in hospitalized children found that nasopharyngeal swabs using traditional rayon-tipped swabs had lower sensitivity compared to washes. however, nasopharyngeal swabs using flocked swabs, which improve the collection and yield of epithelial cells, had similar sensitivity as washes for most viruses tested. the study found that for some viruses, such as adenovirus  adv , nasopharyngeal swabs using flocked swabs had lower sensitivity compared to washes. this could be attributed to low viral loads for adv in the flocked swab samples, as the cycle threshold  ct  value, which indicates the number of amplification cycles needed to detect viral rna, was, on average, 3.3 cycles higher for adv in flocked swab samples compared to wash samples. the study found that the sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swabs using flocked swabs was 100% when they were collected on the same day as the wash, which is reassuring regarding the similar sensitivity of the two methods. however, the uncertainty in the time of collection data could mask real differences in the two tests separated by larger periods of time. the study did not include older children/adults and immunocompromised patients, where viral shedding is commonly lower, so it is unclear how the flocked swab would perform in these populations. the study found that while the sensitivities for flocked swabs were similar to washes for most viruses tested, the flocked swab could reasonably replace washes as a collection method in clinical settings without significant loss of sensitivity for all the viruses tested, except for adv. however, the study noted that collecting a wash followed by a flocked swab in the same nostril may reduce the number of cells collected by the flocked swab and reduce the sensitivity of the assay."
pmc4568430,"the study found that having received vaccination against the seasonal flu virus in the past is the best predictor of future readiness to get vaccinated during another influenza pandemic. this is in line with prior research, as people who normally get flu shots are five times more likely to seek immunization soon after news of a novel influenza pandemic would spread than their counterparts who avoided the seasonal flu shots. the study also found that fear of losing one's life in case of infection with h1n1 is a strong predictor of future vaccination readiness. people who feared for their lives in case of infection with h1n1 are four times more willing to seek vaccination in case of a novel pandemic than people who were not afraid. the study did not find a significant relationship between the assessment of institutional performance during the h1n1 pandemic and future vaccination readiness. this suggests that perception of the official handling of the pandemic is not actually considered by people when making decisions about their own health, as behavioral intention is not the same as behavior, and the former cannot that easily be taken as an indicator of the latter. the study found that having received vaccination against the h1n1 virus in the past did not receive significance due to small n  95% ci  0.30 to 88.36 . however, having received vaccination against the h1n1 virus was still significantly associated with future vaccination readiness. this highlights the fact that behavioral intention is less a willingness to act but rather a willingness to consider. the study found that willingness to get vaccinated next time was best predicted by similar behavior in the past, but willingness was also much more prevalent than actual past behavior. this highlights the fact that behavioral intention is not the same as behavior, and the former cannot that easily be taken as an indicator of the latter. additionally, willingness was much more prevalent than actual past behavior, suggesting that behavioral intention is less a willingness to act but rather a willingness to consider."
pmc3443137,"in the study, the authors found that a new mechanism, nonstop mrna stimulation, decreases the synthesis of the out-of-frame polypeptide and stimulates frameshifting in the context of the c-chord of the tick-borne encephalitis  tbe  virus. the authors discovered that a one-base substitution 11 nucleotides downstream of the c-chord resulted in a 40% reduction in tbe virus activity, which is likely due to an effect on frameshifting. the study suggests that the stalled ribosomes on the poly a  tail of c5 tbe mrna slow down the movement of upstream ribosomes, resulting in  i  greatly reduced synthesis of the out-of-frame polypeptide and  ii  pausing of ribosomes at the frameshift signal, which would stimulate net -1 slippage back into the tbe reading frame. the authors found that the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting in the context of the c-chord is relatively high, but the low level of tbe expression  0.1% of a wild-type virus  is biologically relevant, as it is sufficient to permit some reactivation from latency in mouse ganglia, while an isogenic truly tbe- mutant does not reactivate. the study suggests that ribosomal frameshifting stimulated by nonstop mrna may occur more generally and that at least some transcripts thought to be noncoding or monocistronic might express low, but biologically relevant levels of novel polypeptides because of nonstop stimulation of translational recoding."
pmc4178901,"the present study reports for the first time that the metalloprotease adam17 helps regulate prrsv entry in vitro and that adam17 downregulates the expression level of membrane cd163, which is a prrsv major receptor, from the surface of prrsv permissive cells such as marc-145 and pam. the study shows that adam17 activity reduces prrsv infection at the stage of viral entry rather than any other stage of viral life cycle. the findings indicate that, in addition to contributing to cell activation and apoptosis, adam17 is also involved in resistance to prrsv infection. the study suggests that the modification of adam17 activity affects prrsv entry by shifting the cd163 expression level on the marc-145 cell surface. the findings indicate that because a previous report showed that cd163 expression level decreases upon prrsv infection, it seems that adam17 activity is directly stimulated by viral infection, and that adam17 downregulates cd163, the putative receptor of prrsv, and thereby suppresses prrsv entry."

pmc3879270,"the study found that the tac1 gene, which encodes substance p and neurokinin a, was consistently up-regulated in the pbmcs and the hypothalamus of ev71-infected rhesus macaque infants. this suggests that the gene may play a crucial role in the initiation of the pathogenic events during the progression of ev71 infection, potentially due to its role as an inflammatory agent in the immune reaction induced by ev71. the study also found that the expression level of il-17a in the lungs of ev71-infected rhesus macaque infants exhibited a sustained increase compared with the control group. this suggests that il-17a, as a cytokine responsible for allergic diseases of the respiratory tract, could play an important role in the activation of the immune inflammatory effect through stimulating some of the inflammatory factors and neutrophil recruitment, exacerbating further the increase in the secretion of il-17a by the recruited neutrophils. the study demonstrated that the expression of substance p in the hypothalamus of ev71-infected rhesus macaque infants was remarkably higher than in un-infected animals. this suggests that substance p can improve the production of th17 cells by targeting the immune system. the study found that the expression of substance p in the pbmcs and the cns appears to be correlated with the increase of il-17a in the lungs, an organ damaged in the pathogenesis of ev71 infection. this relationship suggests that it could directly lead to the elucidation of the mechanism behind the pathological changes during ev71 infection. the study found that the dynamic up-regulation of substance p in the pbmc and cns appears to be correlated with the increase of il-17a in the lungs, an organ damaged in the pathogenesis of ev71 infection. this relationship suggests that it could lead to an amplification of the allergic effects through the increased neutrophil recruitment by il-17a, exacerbating further the increase in the secretion of il-17a by the recruited neutrophils."
pmc3383990,"the study found that respiratory viruses are commonly detected in children in the papua new guinea highlands, with a high rate of multiple viral infections, particularly in children with acute lower respiratory tract infection  alri . the study identified adenoviruses, influenza a virus, and respiratory syncytial virus  rsv  as significant contributors to alri in children, with mixed infections being more likely to be associated with alri than with non-alri samples. the study found that picornaviruses, including newly identified species c47 and c48, were not associated with alri, although multiple viruses were commonly detected in both alri and non-alri samples. the study emphasized the importance of both accurate characterization and speciation of viruses and the inclusion of control populations, as the newer nucleic acid detection methods did not detect additional significant respiratory pathogens. the study highlighted the need for infection control measures to prevent spread of respiratory viruses, including adenoviruses, influenza a virus, and rsv, within healthcare and community settings, particularly in light of the significant health impact of these viruses on children with alri."
pmc3387522,"the study demonstrated efficacy of the antibody-biocide fusion product, 4h9-g1-ll37, in treating cryptosporidiosis in calves through improved health parameters and reduced oocyst shedding. the study showed that the treatment regimen consisting of an initial elevated dose during the first 4 h after challenge is important to achieve a therapeutic effect, followed by subsequent regimen consisting of 12-h interval dosing. the study provided proof of concept for a novel biotherapeutic in a clinical model for cryptosporidiosis using the least possible number of animals and the highest technically feasible oral treatment dose. the study revealed that reduction of oocyst shedding is an important factor in helping reduce the parasite pool in the environment and might make a significant contribution to a comprehensive cryptosporidium control program of any given farm. the study showed that a reduction of oocyst shedding in treated animals was not detected, but the study design was strong enough to demonstrate significance in oocyst shedding and overall health parameters, despite the fact that two control animals were lost prematurely due to unrelated complications. the study suggested that lower but multiple challenge dose than that used in the present study might allow a lower treatment dose of the antibody-biocide fusion product to achieve efficacy, as lower oocyst challenge number which results in a lower number of shed oocysts would allow a lower treatment dose of the product to achieve efficacy, as a lower oocyst challenge number which results in a lower number of shed oocysts would allow a lower treatment dose of the product to achieve efficacy."
pmc2224449,"the current study identifies the c-terminal half of the crd1 segment of elr1 as the critical domain mediating gp90 binding, and leu70 as the critical residue within this domain necessary for functional binding of elr1 to gp90. substitution of the his70 residue in murine hvea with amino acids containing aromatic side chains or charged side chains fails to produce gp90 binding, while substitutions with amino acids containing hydrophobic alkyl side chains result in gp90 binding and function as a receptor for eiav infection. the results suggest that not only is hydrophobic important, but also the size and shape of the side chain for the amino acid at residue position 70 are critical for optimal envelope-receptor binding. the molecular modeling studies of the crd1 domain indicate that the hydrophobic leu in the β-turn projects outward, dominating the surface profile of this putative binding determinant, and that the properties of this side chain are critical for binding to the receptor binding groove of the eiav envelope. comparison of the predicted three-dimensional structures for cd134 and elr1 reveals that the cd134 asp60 is at the same position as the leu70 of elr1, and suggests common themes in the use of tnfr family proteins as virus receptors and also reveals common structural motifs in the envelope proteins of these diverse viruses that are utilized for receptor binding."

pmc4505673,"the study introduced an artificial cleavage recognition site for the furin protease into the pedv spike protein, resulting in trypsin-independent cell-cell fusion and virus entry in vitro. the furin cleavage site at the s2′ position of the pedv spike protein enabled the virus to infect cultured cells independently of trypsin, confirming the requirement for cleavage at this site for activation of coronavirus spike fusion proteins. the study found that the introduction of an artificial furin cleavage site at the s2′ position of the pedv spike protein did not result in detectable cleavage of virion-incorporated spike proteins, indicating that the introduced furin cleavage site was rather inaccessible for furin. the study showed that while field strains of pedv strictly require exogenous trypsin for propagation in vitro, serial passaging of the virus on cultured cells can lead to trypsin independence, suggesting that the rational or evolutionary adaptation of coronaviruses to the use of ubiquitous, endogenous proteases like furin for the activation of their spike fusion proteins may expand their tropism in vitro and in vivo."
pmc5135296,"the study found that in all four us states studied, the majority of rsv infections in children under the age of 5 are caused by contact with individuals over the age of 50. this highlights the importance of targeting vaccination efforts towards older individuals to prevent rsv transmission to younger, more vulnerable populations. the study also found that in the elderly population, rsv infection is more common in individuals who have experienced multiple rsv infections in the past, suggesting that these individuals may serve as a reservoir for rsv transmission. the study demonstrated that in all four us states studied, the majority of rsv infections in adults over the age of 50 occur in the winter season. this suggests that rsv seasonality may be driven by factors other than temperature, such as indoor crowding during the holiday season. the study found that in all four us states studied, children under the age of 5 who are infected with rsv miss an average of 2.3 days of daycare during the peak of viral load, indicating the importance of targeting vaccination efforts towards childcare facilities to prevent rsv transmission. the study also found that in all four us states studied, rsv infection in children under the age of 5 is more common in individuals who have already experienced multiple rsv infections in the past, suggesting that these individuals may serve as a reservoir for rsv transmission to younger, more vulnerable populations."
pmc2715625,"chloroquine shows strong in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities against hcov-oc43, with an ec50 of 0.306 μm and a selectivity index of 1,369 in vitro, and a survival rate of 69.0% in newborn mice treated with chloroquine via maternal milk. chloroquine is required at the moment of infection to block hcov-oc43 replication, as seen in time-of-addition experiments in vitro, where chloroquine reduced the viral load by 2 logs in comparison to the positive control value, but at later time points, a loss of antiviral activity was noted. the survival rate of newborn mice that received chloroquine only transplacentally was 0%, possibly due to an ineffectively low concentration of chloroquine reached in the newborn mice, as chloroquine accumulates in tissue and organs of the mother and the fetus, resulting in high chloroquine concentrations in maternal milk. treatment with daily doses of chloroquine has a long-lasting protective effect against lethal coronavirus oc43 infection in newborn mice, with a survival rate of 69.0% in newborn mice treated with chloroquine via maternal milk, which is lower than the survival rate of newborn mice whose mothers received chloroquine postpartum. chloroquine is more potent in inhibiting hcov-oc43 replication than in inhibiting sars-cov replication, as seen in in vitro studies, where the ec50 of chloroquine against hcov-oc43 was 0.306 μm, while the ec50 against sars-cov was 8.8 μm."
pmc3167978,"this study reports for the first time an association between oas1 polymorphisms and prostate cancer. the functional oas1 polymorphic markers rs2660 and rs1131454 are associated with a disease/viral infection. in general, the rs2660 aa genotype promotes disease susceptibility, whereas the gg genotype confers protection. the aa genotype, which is associated with prostate cancer, appears to be a risk factor with age in prostate cancer, as expected. the absence of an rs2660 homozygous gg genotype in individuals of african ethnicity is essentially consistent with population-wide genotype distribution reported in the nih dbsnp database. the frequency of the g allele in the ss38908277 african american set is only 0.09%, compared with a frequency of 9.7%  exclusively from the ag genotype  in the normal african american sample set. this suggests that oas1 polymorphisms and perhaps spliced variants may be determined genetically in african americans. in addition to rs2660, rs10774671 and rs3177979  all on exon 7  also are nonsynonymous and in linkage disequilibrium. it will be interesting to investigate whether the proposed linkage disequilibrium exists between this block in prostate cancer cells and in the sample set. polymorphisms in oas1 like rs2660 not only can modulate the effects of higher risk susceptibility genes responsible for hereditary prostate cancer but also may promote sporadic prostate cancer independently, possibly because of congenital rubella virus infection."
pmc6002070,"the authors introduce a novel approach, called reduced iteratively regularized gauss-newton  rirgn , to estimate parameters and generate forecasts for epidemics using the generalized richards equation, a simple phenomenological 4-parameter model. this method combines regularization techniques with a reduced hessian approximation, which lowers the condition number and enforces a symmetric non-negative definite structure. the authors apply their method to estimate parameters and generate forecasts for the 2014-2015 ebola epidemics in guinea, liberia, and sierra leone using early incident reported data. they find that the method is effective in tracking the epidemics in liberia and sierra leone, but has more difficulties with the multi-mode nature of the epidemic in guinea. the authors highlight the importance of choosing the right regularization sequence, {α₀ₙ}, to ensure stability and reduce excessive noise propagation. they also discuss the role of prior knowledge in selecting the initial vector, q₀, and the reference vector, qₖ, in the penalty term. the authors note that their method could be adapted to analyze outbreaks of other disease systems, such as avian influenza, middle east respiratory syndrome  mers , and zika. they suggest that disease forecasts could be generated in real time with updates every few weeks or so, depending on the disease system. the authors emphasize the potential of rigorous mathematical approaches for generating reliable parameter estimates and useful epidemic forecasts in the context of the generalized richards equation, a simple phenomenological 4-parameter model, and highlight the need for careful linking of mathematical models with regularization techniques to achieve stable parameter estimation and associated forward projections."
pmc2720240,"the study identified drak2 as a crucial negative regulator of t-cell activation, with opposing phenotypic consequences to those observed with the cox-2-mediated lethal t-cell activation. the study confirmed that silencing drak2 expression in vitro promotes cell survival and abrogates the effects of a cox-2 inhibitor in vitro. the study demonstrated that drak2 expression in colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo is regulated by cox-2. the study identified a cluster of genes showing similar cyclical changes in expression with cell-cycle periodicity in hela cells, which included drak2 and overlapped with cox-2-regulated genes identified by previous gene discovery studies. the study suggested that the ribosomal kinase p70s6 is a substrate for drak2, highlighting a possible involvement in regulation of cell-cycle dynamics."
pmc1828913,"proteome chips have been used to characterize the functions of thousands of proteins in a parallel format. for example, in a study by zhu et al.  2001 , yeast proteome chips were used to identify previously uncharacterized calmodulin binding proteins, revealing a novel consensus binding motif. proteome chips have also been used to discover new functionalities for previously characterized proteins. in another study by hall et al.  2004 , yeast proteome chips were used to identify previously unknown dna binding proteins, including arg5,6, a mitochondrial enzyme that appears to have a role in directly regulating the target-of-rapamycin  tor  dependent nutrient response network. proteome chips have been used to discover protein–drug interactions. in a study by huang et al.  2004 , yeast proteome microarrays were used to probe protein interactions with small molecules in one experiment to discover interactions and to confirm previously known interactions. proteome chips have been used to study protein–receptor interactions in a high-throughput fashion. in a study by jones et al.  2006 , protein microarrays containing most of the human binding domain proteins were probed with 66 fluorescently labeled peptides representing the binding sites of the epidermal growth factor receptors  egfr , and the resulting fluorescence data was used to calculate dissociation constants to determine the binding affinities of the peptide-binding domain interactions. proteome chips have been used to study protein phosphorylation in yeast. in a study by ptacek et al.  2005 , yeast protein kinases or kinase complexes were overexpressed in yeast, and a yeast proteome microarray was created to screen patient's sera for the presence of antibodies against coronaviruses. they found that their coronavirus protein array was an excellent way to quickly diagnose those patients displaying symptoms of sars infection."
pmc1346853,"the 7a protein, encoded by the sars-cov virus, inhibits cellular protein synthesis and activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase  mapk  pathway. expression of the 7a protein in cells causes an increase in activated p38 mapk, indicating that it may contribute to cytopathogenesis of sars-cov. the 7a protein is likely to activate pro- or antiapoptotic golgi proteins, which may result in the promotion of apoptosis. the sars-cov virus may encode additional proteins that inhibit cellular translation, in addition to the 7a protein. the mechanism of apoptosis induced by the sars-cov virus is yet to be determined, but the data presented suggest that the sars-cov 7a protein inhibits translation and activates p38 mapk."
pmc1860290,"the study identified humoral responses to some of the epitopes on the sars-cov genome, including the membrane  m  and nucleocapsid  n  proteins. these responses may serve as potential markers for the viral infection and be important in vaccine development against this new fatal infectious disease. the study showed strong humoral responses to the membrane  m  protein, which is a relatively small viral structural protein. antibody against m was found to be common among all the subjects and elicited strong, persistent responses. the study found that antibody against m was associated with susceptibility of sars in a locality. this may be useful in diagnostic tests and in surveillance. the study showed that the humoral responses to m protein may be important in the development of vaccine for this new fatal infectious disease. the study identified important antigenic sites on the sars-cov genome, which may serve as potential markers for the viral infection and be important in vaccine development against this new fatal infectious disease. these specific antigenic sites may also be important for the design of bedside diagnostic tests."
pmc5850400,"the discovery of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus  mers-cov  in 2012 has led to over 2,500 reported cases and a mortality rate exceeding 35%. this is higher than the mortality rate seen during the severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  epidemic, which disappeared within a year. the mers-cov epidemic has persisted for over three years, suggesting that it is periodically introduced into human populations and may cause severe disease in patients with underlying medical conditions. the pattern of mers-cov lineages is more consistent with the movement of infected livestock or animal products, increasing the risk for future pandemics. population-based studies are needed to determine the involvement of mers-cov in other body systems and to clarify the chain of mers-cov zoonotic transmissions. the development of mers-cov full-length infectious clones allows for the systematic experimental study of the roles of the various corresponding mers-cov proteins, which should lead to a better understanding of the role of the viral genes in infectivity and pathogenicity. this manipulation of the virus genome also provides a reverse genetics platform that could lead to the future development of mers-cov-based vector vaccines."
pmc6832244,"tsb and tsf extracts from t. sinensis attenuated hepatocellular lipid accumulation through ampk, ppar, and lc3 pathway activation and inhibition of lipogenic protein expression. both tsb and tsf extracts showed anti-lipogenic activity and improved lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, with either extract showing similar effects. gallic acid, quercetin, rutin, and toosendanin, active components of t. sinensis extracts, exhibited anti-steatotic effects on high-fat-diet-fed mice or 3t3-l1 preadipocytes. tsb and tsf extracts did not cause cytotoxicity, suggesting the potential in targeting steatosis, and both mainly ameliorated lipid accumulation through ampk, ppar, and lc3 pathway activation and inhibition of lipogenic protein expression. the upstream key regulator, including mammalian target of rapamycin and akt, will be examined further to elucidate the anti-steatotic effects of tsb or tsf."
pmc5253590,"the study found that patients older than 51 years represented a larger than expected fraction of outbreak cases compared to non-outbreak cases, suggesting that older individuals are at increased risk of dying from mers-cov infection. nosocomial infections occurred more frequently among outbreak cases compared to non-outbreak cases, indicating that nosocomial outbreaks are fueled by nosocomial infections. healthcare workers comprised 22% of all saudi arabian mers-cov cases diagnosed up to october 2015, consistent with previous studies reporting predominantly male patients with mers-cov infection. the study found that 17% of non-outbreak cases and 10% of outbreak cases reporting data on camel exposure indicated that patients owned or raised camels, suggesting that camel exposure, and thus zoonotic transmission, may be more common among sporadic, non-outbreak cases than among outbreak cases. improved future surveillance may allow for faster identification of sporadic mers-cov cases, as outbreak cases have been confirmed faster than non-outbreak cases, indicating that faster implementation of infection control measures in healthcare settings may be critical to preventing future outbreaks."
pmc2289992,"this study demonstrates that cpbvdv-induced cytoplasmic vacuolization is an early response to viral infection that is distinct from apoptosis and necrosis. the autophagy-like cellular response to cpbvdv is different from apoptosis, necrosis, and recently described necroapoptosis. virus-induced vacuoles possess phagocytic properties, responsible for digestion of cytoplasm and cytoplasmic components, suggesting that this form of vacuole-mediated autolysis could be named phagoptosis. three classes of autophagy have been described  macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and microautophagy. bvdv-induced cytoplasmic vacuolization is inconsistent with macroautophagy. the absence of three out of four parameters for determination of macroautophagy suggests that bvdv-induced vacuolization is different from macroautophagy."

pmc4088202,"in both forms of acute pancreatitis, there is a significant depletion of circulating lymphocytes, with a more profound depletion in severe acute pancreatitis. in the early period of pancreatitis, the magnitude of peripheral depletion is similar for t- and b- lymphocytes, but in the late stage of severe acute pancreatitis, b- lymphocytes are particularly depleted. in both forms of acute pancreatitis, serum levels of il-2, ifn-γ, tnf-α, il-4, il-5, and il-10 are significantly increased, with the highest values found in severe acute pancreatitis. in both forms of acute pancreatitis, there is a strong shift in the cd7+/cd19+ ratio, implying a predominance of t- over b- lymphocytes in severe acute pancreatitis. among t- lymphocytes, there is a significant depletion of cd4+ cells in mild and severe acute pancreatitis, while cd8+ cells are in the normal range. in both forms of acute pancreatitis, there is an overwhelming pro-inflammatory response, which can be followed by a second response that involves down-regulation of ifn-γ and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as il-10 and tgf-β. in both forms of acute pancreatitis, there is a significant activation of t- and b- lymphocytes, which may be explained by the significant activation of t- as well as b- lymphocytes, despite a significant decrease in the number of circulating lymphocytes. the data obtained in this study suggest that the depletion of lymphocytes in acute pancreatitis may result from both excessive apoptosis and migration to the site of inflammation."
pmc2860510,"b19v infection is associated with severe anemia in malaria-endemic regions, and this anemia is exacerbated by prior use of the antimalarial drug, chloroquine  cq . cq promotes b19v viral replication in bone marrow, resulting in a higher number of particles available for nuclear targeting. other viral infections, such as sfv, emcv, and ebv, are also enhanced by cq but not by other 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial drugs. the lowest hemoglobin concentrations are in children with both igm and pcr positivity, who were presumably at the stage of maximal viral replication and consequent bone marrow suppression. the prevalence of severe malarial anemia should fall as a result of the increasing emergence of resistant p. falciparum and p. vivax and the decreasing use of cq throughout the tropics."
pmc2722738,"a model based on canadian influenza surveillance data estimated a sensitivity for influenza testing of 30% to 40%, which is significantly lower than standard assay sensitivities documented in the literature. the large number of false negative test results suggests a need for standardization of diagnostic test procedures and algorithms used in different laboratories. the model suggests that false negative test results may be attributed to co-infection with other respiratory viruses. the model indicates that false negative test results may be attributed to sample quality, handling, and timing of collection after symptom onset. improved diagnostic accuracy is important for improving our understanding of influenza epidemiology and for guiding preventive and therapeutic interventions."
pmc5755876,"a significant reduction in primary care consultations for children < 2 years old was observed after the introduction of tiv in taiwan in 2004. with the increased vaccine coverage rate, there was an additional decline in the incidence of acute otitis media  aom  in 2005 and 2006, but this was only observed in vaccine-eligible children and not in older children who were not enrolled in the influenza vaccination program. the study provides additional evidence of the efficacy of tiv against aom, with data from 803,592 children over the period october 2000 through march 2007 analyzed, and outpatient visits in seven consecutive influenza seasons studied. the study identified a significant decline in the incidence of outpatient visits with aom in children < 2 years old, who were enrolled in the free influenza vaccination program launched by the taiwan centers for disease control  cdc  in 2004-2006. the study found that, in addition to the direct protection provided by the vaccination, tiv may have induced some herd immunity that further contributed to the reduction in influenza attack rates and the rates of associated aom in children < 2 years old."

pmc4522970,"differences in host responses  through computational analysis of gene expression changes, it was found that infection with mers-cov strain eng 1 induced early kinetic changes, between 3 and 12 hours post infection, compared to infection with strain sa 1. robust transcriptional changes distinguished the two strains predominantly at the late time points, with differential expression of innate immune and pro-inflammatory responsive genes as a result of ifn, tnf, and il-1α signaling. topological differences  comparative transcriptional analysis using topological techniques, such as persistence homology and filtered clustering, revealed topological differences in the kinetics and magnitude of the host response to mers-cov sa 1 and eng 1, with differential expression of genes involved in extracellular remodeling following eng 1 infection and differential pro-inflammatory responses. viral protein differences  the predicted activation for stat3 mediating gene expression relevant for epithelial cell-to-cell adherens and junction signaling in eng 1 infection suggests that these transcriptional differences may be the result of amino acid differences in viral proteins known to modulate innate immunity during mers-cov infection. cytokine-stimulated transcriptomics  combining statistical analysis of infection and cytokine-stimulated calu-3 transcriptomics, it was identified that eng 1 infection upregulated extracellular remodeling genes, while differential pro-inflammatory responses were observed. innate immune and pro-inflammatory responses  differential expression of genes involved in innate immune and pro-inflammatory responsive genes as a result of ifn, tnf, and il-1α signaling was observed following infection with mers-cov sa 1 and eng 1, with these differences predominantly observed at late time points."
pmc2922235,"the study identified two concentration-dependent binding sites for adamantane drugs on m2 ion channels, with binding affinity values differing by approximately three orders of magnitude. using site-directed mutagenesis, the study mapped the binding sites to the ion channel and a lipid component of the m2 protein complex. the study found that the binding affinity for the lipid component was significantly lower than that for the ion channel component, suggesting that the lipid component may not independently inhibit m2 ion channels. the study also identified an allosteric relationship between the lipid and ion channel components, suggesting that binding at the lipid site may synergistically influence the inhibitory action of the ion channel component. the study confirmed the formation of liposomes using dynamic light scattering measurements and electron microscopy images. the study used spur, a data analysis program, to format the data for export and to allow for normalization of the data relative to the amount of liposomes bound to the surface. the study found that the dissociation constant for the lipid component was significantly lower than that for the ion channel component, indicating that the lipid component may not independently inhibit m2 ion channels. the study used equilibrium steady-state measurements, using maximal response values during the addition of the drug, to analyze binding experiments. the study found that the lipid component of the m2 protein complex had a significantly lower binding affinity than the ion channel component, suggesting that the lipid component may not independently inhibit m2 ion channels. the study also identified an allosteric relationship between the lipid and ion channel components, suggesting that binding at the lipid site may synergistically influence the inhibitory action of the ion channel component."
pmc3037318,"during the h1n1 influenza pandemic, only 40% of critical care clinicians reported having extensive knowledge of h1n1 influenza, despite almost 90% receiving relevant training. the study found major gaps between critical care clinicians' knowledge and recommended infection control measures, representing a serious public health concern. about 18% of critical care clinicians reported being unlikely to work during an influenza pandemic, with the major reason being safety concerns. education programs might lead to higher compliance with infection control measures and a reduction in multi-resistant bacteria in hospital settings. the study highlights the need for knowledge training programs to improve critical care clinicians' understanding of the risks and prevention strategies during pandemics, which will in turn improve confidence in providing the right care to patients and protecting themselves."
pmc3075080,"the ace2/ang- 1–7 /mas signaling pathway in the brain is involved in the regulation of blood pressure, sympathetic outflow, and cardiovascular functions. ang- 1–7  activation of the mas receptor leads to the inhibition of angiotensin ii-mediated effects, such as vasoconstriction, aldosterone secretion, and thirst, through the activation of a reciprocal inhibition between the two ras axes. the mas receptor is involved in the regulation of learning and memory, as its deficiency in mice leads to impairments in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks and synaptic plasticity. ang- 1–7  stimulation promotes endothelial nitric oxide synthase  enos  phosphorylation and upregulation, which can preserve endothelial function and reduce oxidative stress in human endothelial cells. the nontraditional components of the ras, such as aminopeptidase a and prorenin receptor, play critical roles upstream and downstream of angiotensin ii, and their inhibition or blockade can lead to beneficial effects in the treatment of cardiovascular and other pathologies."
pmc4542197,"the 1977 influenza epidemic has been attributed to various explanations over time, including deliberate release, vaccine trials or challenges, and laboratory accidents. historical and epidemiological aspects of the 1977 influenza epidemic suggest that it could have been caused by deliberate release, as the soviet union employed tens of thousands of scientists to make biological weapons, and influenza was considered to be an incapacitating agent, especially to those without previous exposure to a specific virus strain. the epidemiological investigation at military academies revealed no link to other outbreaks nor a temporal association between the onset of cases and athletic competitions with other institutions with influenza cases, but the outbreak at the us air force academy in colorado in february 1978 was so severe that all academic and military training was suspended. between 1962 and 1973, almost 40,000 children participated in eight live attenuated influenza virus  laiv  trials in the soviet union, and scientists at the peking vaccine and serum institute in china also carried out clinical trials using laiv during the same time period. between 1962 and 1973, almost 40,000 children participated in eight live attenuated influenza virus  laiv  trials in the soviet union, and scientists at the peking vaccine and serum institute in china also carried out clinical trials using laiv during the same time period. the possibility that the 1977-1978 strain resulted from vaccine challenge or trials is supported by the fact that laiv research was extensive at the time, and a comparison of all 1977 strains shows a higher prevalence of the ts phenotype than in 1950 strains, suggesting that the outbreak may have resulted from attempts at attenuation for vaccine purposes."

pmc4332838,"non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors, such as nim811, alisporivir, and scy-635, have shown promising antiviral activity against hepatitis c  hcv  and hepatitis b  hbv  viruses in vitro and in clinical trials. these inhibitors target host factors, such as cyclophilins, that are critical for viral replication and assembly, rather than the viruses themselves. the development of cyclophilin inhibitors offers the potential benefit of a high barrier to resistance, broad genotype coverage, and an accelerated development path with known inhibitors and even the possibility of broad-spectrum antivirals. cyclophilin inhibitors also appear to play an important role in the replication of other viruses, such as influenza, herpes simplex virus, human cytomegalovirus, vaccinia virus, and human papillomavirus. while challenges remain to better understand mechanisms of action and toxicity, the discovery and development of cyclophilin inhibitors exemplify the opportunities and challenges in pursuing host-targeting antivirals."
pmc4645311,"the study identified highly diverse bat coronaviruses  btcovs  belonging to the species betacoronavirus 1, alphacoronavirus 1, and alphacoronavirus 2, including a previously unreported alphacoronavirus 2 in a captive alpaca from the united states. these viruses formed one species together with human coronavirus 229e  hcov-229e , suggesting a long evolutionary history of hcov-229e in old world hipposiderid bats that greatly exceeds that of hcov-229e in humans. the study also identified btcovs in hipposiderid bats from ghana, nigeria, thailand, and gabon, separating these viruses from hcov-229e in humans. the study found that btcovs in hipposiderid bats from ghana, nigeria, thailand, and gabon are genetically related to hcov-229e in humans, indicating restriction of these viruses to hipposiderid bat genera. this finding supports previous hypotheses from the study group that the spike gene of hcov-229e in humans is related to btcovs in hipposiderid bats. the study identified putative intraspike recombination events between btcovs in hipposiderid bats from ghana and nigeria, suggesting that recombination events may occur in btcovs in hipposiderid bats. the study found that a btcov in a captive alpaca from the united states contained an intact orf8, which was genetically related to the homologous gene in btcovs in hipposiderid bats and in hcov-229e in humans. this finding suggests that alpacas may represent a first host switch from bats followed by a second interhost transfer from alpacas to humans, as the relatedness of the alpaca virus and other hcov-229e strains is rather to old hcov-229e strains reported by crossley et al.  2012  than to contemporary ones reported by zaki et al."
pmc1636472,"the authors have developed a novel nucleic acid signal detection system based on the cleavage of a phosphodiester linkage in a dual-dye-labeled oligonucleotide probe by the endo iv enzyme from e. coli. this system requires a fluorophore attached through a rigid linker to the oligonucleotide and a helper oligonucleotide, as well as a relatively rigid linker in the probe substrate to convey the exquisite specificity of endo iv cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage. the authors have optimized the parameters influencing the activity of the endo iv enzyme, including the temperature, the linker structure, the probe length, and the concentration of the enzyme, enhancer, and target sequences. the use of a rigid linker and short probes  10mer to 12mer  contributes to the improved mismatch discrimination and specificity of endo iv cleavage. the authors have disclosed the synthesis of fluorophore analogs coupled to a rigid linker and solid support, used in the synthesis of labeled oligonucleotides for the probes. the authors have demonstrated the combination of the endo iv assay with a pcr as a post-amplification detection system, which allows for clear allele differentiation due to the excellent spacing of scatter plot endpoint signals of no template controls, wild-type, mutant, and heterozygous samples, unlike other endpoint genotyping methods, which may suffer from overlapping endpoint signals due to pcr efficiency issues. the authors have successfully used the endo iv post-pcr genotyping system for >5,000 genotype assays in an industry setting. the use of the endo iv assay in genotyping assays allows for flexibility in probe design due to the ability to put the mismatch in any one of positions 1-6, contributing to the improved mismatch discrimination. the endo iv post-pcr genotyping system allows for the use of probes shorter than those typically used in other methods, contributing to improved mismatch discrimination and specificity of endo iv cleavage."
pmc5167628,"a rbd fragment containing residues 377-588 of mers-cov s protein is a critical neutralizing domain  cnd  capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov infection. fusing the mers-cov rbd fragment with a trimerization motif, fd, forms a trimeric structure that binds strongly to mers-cov rbd-specific, conformational epitope-targeting mabs, as well as mers-cov's receptor dpp4. rbd-fd protein, formed by fusing the mers-cov rbd fragment with fd, is able to elicit highly efficacious igg antibodies, along with th2-based igg1 and th1-based igg2 antibody responses. rbd-fd protein, formed by fusing the mers-cov rbd fragment with fd, is able to induce long-term and highly potent neutralizing antibodies against infections of live and pseudotyped mers-cov of divergent strains isolated in the 2012-2015 outbreaks. the protective efficacy of rbd-fd protein is largely associated with neutralizing antibodies, as all of the mice survived from mers-cov infection had relatively high serum neutralizing antibody titers, suggesting that neutralizing antibodies, rather than cellular immune responses, may play a key role to prevent mers-cov infection in trimeric rbd-based subunit vaccines."

pmc2950129,"early on, it was estimated that antivirals were successful when early treatment was administered to those infected with the pandemic virus [21],[22]. this was supported by observational studies in canada, germany, and the uk, which showed that antivirals were beneficial in reducing hospitalization and mortality among high-risk groups such as critically ill patients in intensive care units [23],[24]. school closures were associated with reduced transmission of the pandemic virus among children in western japan and hong kong [25],[26]. greater population benefit may occur in reducing transmission during the pandemic among those with higher risk of severe disease, as seen in the uk [27],[28]. the pandemic virus transmitted efficiently among children and at least one study has shown that school closures were beneficial in reducing transmission during the pandemic among children in some countries [29],[30]. pharmaceutical antivirals for treatment and chemoprophylaxis had not been widely used in pandemics before, but their potential benefits in reducing hospitalization and mortality among high-risk groups such as critically ill patients in intensive care units have been demonstrated in observational studies in canada, germany, and the uk [31],[32]."
pmc2681120,"the study in kenya found that 19% of bat fecal samples were positive for coronaviruses, with 39 distinct sequences identified. the phylogenetic analysis revealed that bat coronaviruses in kenya can be classified into two major groups  1 and 2 , with the majority belonging to group 1. the study demonstrated that some bat species carry multiple distinct coronaviruses, as seen in chaerophon spp. miniopterus inflatus, and rousettus aegyptiacus bats. the findings suggest that some coronaviruses, such as those in the btcov1a-like and bthku8-like clusters, are specifically adapted to miniopterus spp. bats and not easily transmitted to other bat species. the study highlights the importance of bats as a source for the introduction of coronaviruses into other species globally, emphasizing the need for increased understanding of the extent and diversity of coronavirus infection in bats."
pmc3752759,"this investigation led to the conclusion that we were dealing with a cluster of primary pneumonic plague  ppp  cases. the clinical illnesses including rapid incubation, fulminant progression, bloody sputum, progressive segmental consolidation, cavitation  in one case , and hypotension are all typical of ppp. although initial negative f1 antibody tests for plague were misleading as to cause of the illnesses, tests for f1 antibody are often negative in patients who are treated with effective antibiotics, if sera are taken within 2 weeks of onset, as were done in these cases. the epidemiologic pattern also exhibited features of ppp. other infectious agents that cause pneumonia will result in a substantial proportion of asymptomatic or mild infections relative to each case of severe pneumonia. for these other agents, with the possible exception of sars, one would rarely expect more than one case of secondary pneumonia in a small group. under the conditions of close exposure in an enclosed space, ppp is among a very small number of organisms that can yield high secondary attack rates of severe pneumonias. in this cluster, person-to-person transmission of ppp caused infection of three persons and probably a fourth  the mother  within the confines of a truck cab. despite many more person-hours of contact, family members of secondary cases were not infected nor were medical staff who attended all the patients without any special protective measures."
pmc4801059,"a cross-sectional study found that viral infection in the upper respiratory tract alters the bacterial community in the tract, with a high pneumococcal colonization density and capsule polysaccharide and pneumolysin production reduced, and synthesis of the bacterial adhesin phosphorylcholine increased [121]. in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that viruses can promote entry and colonization of the lower respiratory tract for select bacterial species via a range of biological mechanisms, including urt biofilm dispersion, increased bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cell by upregulation of cell receptors, reduced pulmonary clearance, impairment of multiple components of the innate immune response, and changes in inflammatory response [92-94, 100, 104-105, 127-130]. viruses can increase nasopharyngeal carriage density and increase risk of pneumococcal pneumonia by altering bacterial selection in the upper respiratory tract, as observed in both human populations and animal models [26, 121]. viral infections can lead to impairment and depletion of resident alveolar macrophages and neutrophils necessary for bacterial clearance, mediated by induction of type i interferons, and desensitization to toll-like receptor ligands [101-103, 104]. viral infections can exacerbate inflammatory mediators, cytokines, and chemokines, causing tissue damage and increasing susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections in the lower respiratory tract [6]."

pmc4879323,"the present study demonstrates that the alv-j strain scau-hn06 produces an almost undetectable antiviral innate immune response in 1 week old chicks. cytokines, including il-6, il-10, and ifn-β, were induced in yellow chickens with tumors caused by alv-j infection, but ifn-stimulated gene expression was not induced normally during the late phase of alv-j infection. the study reveals that alv-j was primarily recognized by chicken tlr7 at 1 day post infection and mda5 was the main sensing receptor during the late phase of alv-j infection. the study demonstrates that irf1 and stat1 expression levels are decreased in chickens with tumors induced by alv-j infection, suggesting that alv-j escapes through inhibition of the host antiviral immune response by modulating the jak-stat signaling pathway. the study highlights that functional isgs cannot be induced in the late infection phase, as irf1 expression is decreased as a target of mir-23b in white  recessive  plymouth rock chickens with alv-j infection, and the antiviral activity of irf1 is inhibited during the late phase of alv-j infection."

pmc5113920,"the study identified two rrxr motifs in the context of sftsv-gc and showed that mutation of these motifs or inhibition of proprotein convertase activity did not affect gn/gc processing or viral infectivity, suggesting that these motifs are not cleavage sites for proprotein convertases in the context of sftsv-gc. the study demonstrated that signal peptidase liberated gc from gn/gc and that deletion of the predicted signal peptide or removal of the amino acids preceding the predicted cleavage site in the context of sftsv-gc abrogated gn/gc processing and viral infectivity, indicating that signal peptidase might generate the n-terminus of mature gc. the study found that gn expression was required for particle incorporation of gc and that gc was mainly localized in the er when expressed alone, while coexpression of gn resulted in accumulation of gc in the golgi apparatus, the site of bunyavirus assembly and budding, suggesting that gn might function as a chaperon for gc. the study showed that expression of gn or gc alone in particle producing cells incorporated more gc and was more infectious than their counterparts produced in cells transfected with separate gn and gc expression plasmids, despite increased gn expression and particle incorporation under the latter conditions. the study suggested that the long cytoplasmic tail of sftsv-gn might mask a lysine at position -3 in the cytoplasmic tail of sftsv-gc, which is conserved between diverse bunyaviruses and is required for er localization, and that the chaperon activity of gn might depend on gn-gc interactions formed with high efficiency only after proteolytic separation of these proteins from the gn/gc precursor during glycoprotein biogenesis."
pmc3152274,"in the context of liver transplantation, hepatitis c  hcv  is a complex problem for transplant recipients. while initial hcv-infected patients were not considered appropriate candidates for transplantation due to increased risk of mortality following transplantation, more recent studies have suggested that hcv-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy  haart  have improved survival compared to historical controls. however, hcv-infected patients still experience increased morbidity from other chronic conditions, such as end-stage renal disease. in the context of respiratory viral infections, prevention involves avoidance of other infected individuals, hand hygiene, and use of droplet precautions for those suspected of having infection. treatment for respiratory viral infections involves supportive care and, in some cases, the use of antiviral medications. seasonal screening should be considered for donors before transplant by serologic and/or nucleic acid testing. in the context of renal transplantation, respiratory viral infections in transplant recipients continue to have significant impact on patient outcomes. reports have demonstrated that west nile virus  wnv , a flavivirus that causes a febrile illness and can be fatal, is transmissible through organ transplantation. recipients who acquire wnv from their donors have increased morbidity and mortality, and the impact of newer immunosuppressive strategies continues to promote the development of severe viral infections. in the context of hepatitis b  hbv  in the renal transplant population, recognition of hbv in patients with chronic renal failure may be confounded by the limited sensitivity of serologic diagnosis in this population. while initial hbv-infected individuals were not considered appropriate candidates for transplantation, more recent studies have not demonstrated significant rejection, and patients did not experience significant infection-related morbidity following transplantation. however, hbv-infected patients still require careful management of immunosuppression along with supportive care. in the context of human immunodeficiency virus  hiv  in renal transplant recipients, hiv-infected patients receiving renal transplants may be at higher risk of acute rejection"
pmc4910525,"the study documents the first reported outbreak of canine distemper virus  cdv  in endangered giant pandas in china, resulting in the deaths of six out of six affected pandas. the study reveals that the surviving giant panda, previously vaccinated against cdv, did not develop clinical signs despite cdv recovery from blood and nasal swab samples, suggesting that vaccination may have attenuated disease. the study identifies unique amino acid substitutions in the cdv h protein encoded by the giant panda/sx/2014 isolate, which have not been observed previously in asia-1 strains, potentially facilitating cdv infection of giant pandas. the study highlights the need for universal cdv vaccination of captive giant pandas for successful conservation of this endangered species, as the outbreak demonstrates the importance of heightened surveillance and vaccination. the study also suggests that histopathological analysis and virus isolation from tissue samples collected from cdv-infected giant pandas may be useful in the investigation of cdv infection in captive animals."
pmc5403965,"the small transmembrane proteins 90k, ifitm1-3, and members of the serinc protein family can all reduce the particle infectivity of hiv-1 by modifying the essential particle composition or by incorporating into nascent virions, respectively. the antiviral effect of 90k and ifitm proteins is more obvious when expressed in infected donor cells that transmit the virus to ifitm-negative target cells, as they are incorporated into membranes of nascent virions and decrease their particle infectivity by impairing fusion. in the context of other viruses, multiple, partially contradicting models have been debated regarding the mode of action of virus-associated ifitm proteins, including inhibition of viral membrane fusogenicity, restriction of viral membrane hemifusion, disruption of cholesterol homeostasis, and exclusion and inclusion of yet to be defined specific cellular factors with antiviral activity. nef-mediated enhancement of hiv-1 particle infectivity requires its expression in the producer cell, is highly conserved within primate lentiviruses, and is maintained during disease progression. nef is also incorporated into virus particles and cleaved by hiv-1 protease during maturation of particles. its membrane association may be sufficient to result in virion packaging, as nef is also found in orthologous retroviruses when co-expressed in the producer cell. the antiviral activity of serinc proteins is caused predominantly by post-entry defects, as expression of serinc3 and serinc5 are not induced or stimulated by type i interferons, in contrast to the targets of most other viral antagonists. serinc5 inhibition acts specifically against env-containing particles, as vsv-g pseudotypes were largely insensitive to serinc5. nef was shown to counteract serinc activity by downregulating it from the cell surface via clathrin-dependent endocytosis and sequestering it in endosomes, thus precluding their incorporation into virion particles."
pmc2950260,"the study found a significant association between bacterial infection of the airways and acute wheezing episodes in young children, independent of viral infection, suggesting that bacteria may contribute independently to the burden of wheezing symptoms. viral infection is closely associated with acute exacerbations of asthma, and viruses were identified in 65% of wheezing episodes in the children in the study. however, the type of virus itself is not causally related to symptoms, as bacteria were also more commonly found in wheezing episodes, but with similar distribution when comparing young children with and without wheezing episodes. the study found that bacterial colonization in the copenhagen prospective study on asthma in childhood was similar to that reported in previous cohort studies, although s aureus seemed slightly more common in the study cohort, possibly due to the high rate of breast feeding. the study found that bacteria were more commonly found in wheezing episodes but with similar distribution when comparing young children with and without wheezing episodes. this finding is important because it may have an important impact on treatment, as clinical trials with antibiotic therapy will be required to determine whether this increased detection of bacteria during wheezing episodes has clinical effects that are amenable to modification by appropriate therapy. the study found that bacterial infection of the airways and acute wheezing episodes in young children were similar to but independent of viral infection, suggesting that bacteria may contribute independently to the burden of wheezing symptoms. this finding is significant because it may also contribute to an understanding of the disappointing results from trials of anti-asthma therapies in wheezing illness in early childhood."
pmc4846467,"in a study of 2,207 children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, those with rhinovirus had higher odds of receiving corticosteroids in both the emergency department and during hospitalization compared to those with rsv alone or rsv/rhinovirus coinfection. children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis were more likely to be older, have a history of wheezing and eczema, and receive corticosteroids compared to those with rsv-associated bronchiolitis. the differential treatment of children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis suggests that bronchiolitis is a heterogeneous respiratory illness with potential subgroups that may respond differently to medications. most medication trials for children hospitalized with bronchiolitis require children to be age <12 months and have no history of wheezing, but the present data suggest that these trials should be repeated in children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis. until better case definitions and outcomes for children with lower respiratory infection are developed, clinicians will continue to use asthma exacerbation medications based on intuition rather than scientific data."
pmc3922138,"in a study by capelli and colleagues, they demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides  aos  are effective in restoring dystrophin expression in duchenne muscular dystrophy  dmd  patients through exon-skipping. however, the high doses required and the potential toxicity of aos limit their clinical applicability. to address these limitations, they developed a delivery system using nanoparticles  nps  composed of a poly methyl methacrylate   pmma  core and a random copolymer shell formed by units derived from n-isopropyl acrylamide  nipam  and reactive methacrylate-bearing cationic groups. this system improved the binding capacity of aos on the np surface through the introduction of various reactive functional groups. the study also revealed the potential of nps as nontoxic delivery vectors for aos, as lower doses of aos were required, reducing both the potential side effects and the duration of the administration schedule. a further study by bassi and colleagues showed that the protective effect of np-ao complexes on dystrophin expression persisted long after the end of the treatment, indicating the potential of nps as delivery vectors for aos. the study also revealed that the restored dystrophin was correctly localized on the sarcolemmal membrane of muscle fibers, and the western blotting analysis revealed a protein with the exact molecular weight in np-ao treated mice, while this was undetectable in naked-ao treated mice. a study by rimessi and colleagues showed that ao-loaded nps, which abounded in various tissues and organs of mdx mice treated via intraperitoneal injection, improved dystrophin restoration in both skeletal and cardiac muscles. the study also revealed that the effect of ao-loaded nps on dystrophin expression persisted long after the end of the treatment, indicating the potential of nps as delivery vectors for aos. a study by bassi and colleagues showed that the protective effect of np-ao complexes on dystrophin expression persisted long after the end of the treatment, and the restored dystrophin was"

pmc4664985,"the method of virus inactivation via uv-a exposure in the presence of amt is effective for multiple families of viruses, including segmented and enveloped viruses, as well as those with positive- and negative-sense rna genomes. the level of uv-a exposure time and amt concentration required to inactivate each virus is species-specific and may even be strain-specific. the method allows for virus preparations to be used in vaccine development, in antibody generation for research, as positive controls for antibody-based detection assays, or studied by microscopy, as the surface proteins of the inactivated viruses are intact and correctly oriented, allowing full interactions with cells and protein complexes. the nucleic acids extracted from amt-inactivated viruses are non-infectious and sufficiently undamaged to achieve successful detection by reverse-transcription real-time pcr and next-generation sequencing. the method provides inactive, non-infectious virus preparations that may be reliably sterility tested without attempting to remove toxic chemicals from the preparations, as it allows for virus preparations and genomic material from pathogenic samples to be quickly and safely accessed."
pmc3185490,"the viral protein bicp0 plays dual roles during infection of cattle  it stimulates viral transcription and inhibits innate immune responses. bicp0 can also interact with cellular regulatory factors, such as histone deacetylase 1, histone acetyl transferase p300, and interferon regulatory factor 7. the specific cellular proteins that are targets for proteasomal degradation induced by bicp0 have not been identified. the viral protein ul49.5 inhibits cd8+ t cell recognition of infected cells by inhibiting chemokine-gag interactions, which disrupts chemokine gradients and inhibits immune cell migration. this mechanism is an important one by which the virus evades immune responses. the viral encoded chemokine, gg, inhibits chemokine activity by preventing chemokine-gag interactions, which also disrupts chemokine gradients and inhibits immune cell migration. this mechanism is also important for immune evasion. the viral protein bovine herpesvirus 1 gg is a viral immune evasion gene because it inhibits immune cell migration by preventing chemokine-gag interactions. gg can also interact with bid and cdc42, which are b-cell and monocyte-activating chemokine precursors. the viral protein bovine herpesvirus 1 gg inhibits cell growth, possibly by encoding a small regulatory rna that may act as a micro-rna. the ability of viruses to inhibit innate immune responses dictates host range, the pathogenic potential of a virus, and the ability of a given virus to survive in nature."
pmc6477747,"six randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving 523 children aged 6-10 years with non-β-hemolytic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis or acute bronchitis were analyzed. eps 7630  pelargonium sidoides extract  reduced the cumulative dose of paracetamol by an average of 244mg compared to placebo in 5 out of 6 trials. at treatment end, 30.2% of children who received eps 7630 were still unable to attend school, compared to 74.4% of children who received placebo. in children with acute respiratory tract disorders during infancy, eps 7630 alleviated symptom burden and accelerated recovery, despite having no known antipyretic effect. concomitant use of paracetamol was reduced in children who received eps 7630, even though it is commonly used to improve comfort in children with acute respiratory tract disorders."
pmc3379868,"in a 2-year study of 132 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  ae-copd , an infectious cause was identified in 36.3% of cases. bacterial infections were found in 24.1% of patients, viral infections in 9%, and mixed bacterial and viral infections in 1.5%. the study found that clinical and laboratory variables used to differentiate the cause of ae-copd were similar for bacterial and viral etiologies, except for a relative lymphocyte count, which was lower in the group with viral etiology, and a longer hospitalization period in patients with bacterial infections. the study also found that patients with bacterial infections had a greater involvement of baseline arterial blood gas, with a decrease in ph and partial pressure of oxygen  po2 , and increased leukocytes and heart rate, possibly indicating a bronchospasm component in addition to bacterial infection. the study found that viral diseases have a seasonal distribution and efforts to confirm the diagnosis in routine clinical practice are to be reserved for situations in which viruses are present in the community; otherwise, this diagnosis could lead to a significant economic cost. the study suggests that differentiating the etiology of ae-copd on the basis of clinical and laboratory data is difficult in common clinical practice and that the most profitable diagnostic tests to identify the possible cause of the acute decompensation of a patient with copd are the conventional sputum test for bacteria and molecular biology techniques for viruses."
pmc2726397,"a high frequency of threonine  thr  residues in secreted and membrane proteins, which are n-glycosylated, is a characteristic feature of eukaryotes with n-glycan-dependent quality control  qc  of protein folding. this selection for thr is also observed in viral envelope proteins, which have high sequon densities due to the addition of n-linked glycans. the increased likelihood that asparagine  asn , threonine  thr , and serine  ser  will be present in sequons rather than elsewhere in secreted and membrane proteins is a mechanism for selecting sequons in eukaryotes with n-glycan-dependent qc of protein folding. this selection for sequons results in an increase in the actual density of sequons compared to the expected density based on the frequencies of asn, thr, and ser in the set of secreted proteins for each organism. the low-complexity regions in proteins, which cause misleading amino acid frequencies, are excluded from analyses to accurately predict n-glycan length and n-glycan-associated qc of protein folding. the statistical significance of the difference between the actual and expected sequon densities for each organism is determined using a wilcoxon matched-pairs test, and differences between sequon densities of secreted proteins and cytosolic proteins are compared for each organism to distinguish eukaryotes with n-glycan-dependent qc from eukaryotes without n-glycan-dependent qc of protein folding. the absence of n-glycans is predicted when there are no n-linked glycosyltransferases and no ost present in certain schizosaccharomyces proteins, which are used to infer the presence of an n-glycan-associated qc system for protein folding. this prediction is made by probing with psi-blast the proteins of each organism with the n-linked glycosyltransferases of saccharomyces cerevisiae."
pmc6575592,"the study identifies bcl6 as a critical regulator of neutrophil survival during influenza a virus  iav  infection, which is restricted to the lungs and does not occur in the blood or bone marrow. bcl6-deficient neutrophils in the lungs undergo enhanced apoptosis, leading to decreased neutrophil numbers in the lungs and bal fluid, which contributes to attenuation of host inflammation and disease severity following iav infection. the study demonstrates that the attenuation of deleterious neutrophil responses with low doses of anti-ly6g provides protection against lethal iav infection, suggesting that excessive neutrophil recruitment is a hallmark of acute susceptibility to respiratory bacterial infections. the study identifies a role for bcl6 in modulating neutrophil survival in the tissue, thereby regulating the severity of diseases following iav infection, and further suggests that the precise roles of neutrophil bcl6 in modulating differential disease outcomes following respiratory infections may ultimately depend on the type of pathogen. the study indicates that lung neutrophils express higher noxa levels than blood and bone marrow neutrophils in wild-type mice, and bcl6 deficiency further increases noxa expression specifically in the lungs, suggesting that enhanced noxa expression promotes lung neutrophil apoptosis through antagonizing mc1 expression and/or function in bcl6-deficient neutrophils."

pmc1698363,"the rt-lamp assay reported in this study is a simple diagnostic tool that allows rapid and real-time detection of japanese encephalitis  jev  in clinical specimens. it involves a single-tube accelerated reaction carried out by mixing the buffer, primers, reverse transcriptase, and dna polymerase and incubating the mixture at 63°c for 60 minutes. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  rt-pcr  due to continuous amplification under isothermal conditions using six primers that recognize eight distinct regions of the target. the rt-lamp assay has the advantage of reaction simplicity and detection sensitivity compared to rt-pcr and real-time pcr. the higher amplification efficiency of the rt-lamp reaction yields a large amount of a by-product, pyrophosphate ion, leading to white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate in the reaction mixture. since the increase in turbidity of the reaction mixture according to the production of precipitate correlates with the amount of dna synthesized, real-time monitoring of the rt-lamp reaction can be achieved by real-time measurement of turbidity. the rt-lamp assay allows rapid, real-time detection and quantification of jev in acute-phase csf samples without requiring sophisticated equipment. it has potential usefulness for clinical diagnosis and surveillance of jev in developing countries due to the substantial reduction in time required for confirmation of results compared to conventional rt-pcr. retrospective analysis of clinical samples positive by rt-lamp revealed the presence of virus-specific igm antibodies in corresponding csf samples, suggesting confirmatory infection. the rt-lamp assay has demonstrated a higher sensitivity by correctly detecting nine additional positive samples with low levels of virus that were missed by rt-pcr. these may be the samples collected during the window period of the disease, where the viremia is in decline and the igm antibody started appearing to a detectable limit. the rt-lamp assay has potential for the detection of low-level virus in clinical specimens, which is crucial for the early diagnosis of viral infections. the evaluation of the rt-lamp assay reported in this study was undert"

pmc2995055,"the interaction between the stem-loop structure and the pseudoknot stem, specifically base triple interactions, is crucial for frameshifting efficiency. deletion or mutation of these triple interactions leads to a significant decrease in frameshifting activity, both in vitro and in vivo. the length and composition of loop l2 also play a significant role in frameshifting efficiency. adjustment of the length or composition can lead to a significant decrease in frameshifting activity, both in vitro and in vivo. the presence of a hairpin structure instead of a pseudoknot structure can increase frameshifting efficiency, particularly during heavy ribosomal traffic. the stability and kinetics of pseudoknot folding may also affect frameshifting efficiency, particularly during heavy ribosomal traffic. slow-folding pseudoknots can limit frameshifting efficiency, and the efficiency may not solely be dictated by the stability of the pseudoknot but also by its kinetic properties. the role of stem-loop interactions in frameshifting efficiency suggests that frameshifting is not solely determined by the stability of the pseudoknot structure but also by its kinetic properties, such as mechanical resistance to rna unfolding and folding kinetics."

pmc2870589,"the study found that, in the community setting, most sars patients do not easily transmit infection, with transmission rates ranging between 0% and 10% [7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 21-24]. the reason that hospital transmission is more common than community transmission seems to relate primarily to three factors  the temporal profile of viral excretion, which peaks at around day 11 [25]; the patient profile of viral excretion, which seems to be greater in sicker patients [26]; and the predominant transmission route, which is probably large respiratory droplets, requiring intimate contact with sick patients or the handling of infectious secretions. the study found that, in the community setting, living in the same room as the case, the duration of time spent in the same room as the case, and washing the case's clothes or sheets were not associated with transmission. the finding that 'physically caring' for a symptomatic case was the only factor associated with transmission would support transmission predominantly by large respiratory droplets with limited ability for transmission by environmental contamination, fomites or aerosolization. the study found that isolation of symptomatic cases is a critical control measure, and that the risk of secondary transmission rises once the interval from onset of symptoms to isolation increases above 4 days. the study found that there was no evidence of onward transmission from the two unrecognized infections identified in the study, despite the absence of quarantine for these individuals. this suggests that sub-clinical cases are not important in terms of sustaining transmission, and that analysis of sars-cov serology requires careful interpretation and indicates that elisa screening should be supplemented with additional tests to verify specificity of sars elisa reactivity, especially in the absence of a clinically compatible illness. the study found that, in the community setting, the overall risk of community transmission of sars is low, generally requires intimate and unprotected contact with an ill sars case, and can be further minimized by rapid isolation of symptomatic cases. however, notable and well-publicized exceptions to this rule include the index case in hong kong and the amoy gardens outbreak."
pmc3566288,"the study identifies ifitm1 as a key anti-hcv effector isg that inhibits entry of hcv into hepatocytes by altering the function of essential coreceptors such as cd81. ifitm1 localizes to hepatic tight junctions and mediates cd81 redistribution into the tight junction complex to impose an enhanced association with occludin and other tight junction factors, disrupting the assembly of coreceptor interactions and suppressing the hcv entry process. the study proposes that the primary role of tetraspanins such as cd81 is the organization of membrane complex formation, an essential process in viral entry into host cells and a likely target of ifitm1-mediated viral disruption. the study demonstrates that ifitm1 localizes to hepatic tight junctions and provides new insights into the cellular functions of this molecule. the study suggests that strategies that effectively induce ifitm1 expression and function could serve to improve existing anti-hcv therapies to increase sustained sustained virologic response rates."
pmc2446958,"the sars-cov protein 6 interacts with cellular factors involved in nuclear protein import, preventing their entry into the nucleus and suppressing antiviral responses. this function of protein 6 is provided by its n-terminal hydrophobic portion, and its central activity is largely independent of effects on the virus. reducing importin-β levels in cells using sirnas specific for importin-β mrnas can functionally replace the c-terminal residues of protein 6, arguing for a bifunctional accelerator of mhv growth with major contributions from the n-terminal residues and independent contributions from the c-terminal residues once protein 6 levels are sufficiently high to achieve titration of nuclear import factors. disrupting classical nuclear import pathways can modestly improve mhv replication, as nuclear transport machinery controls the bidirectional transport of many biologically important molecules, and these pathways must be maintained for host cells to mount effective antiviral responses. the distribution of proteins in cell nuclei and cytosol might be globally altered by protein 6 in ways that create superior environments for the replication of coronaviruses. the c-terminal portion of protein 6 can sequester importin-β, a crucial protein carrier, from nuclear entry, which can limit the nuclear accumulation of 3xgfp-sv40 nls and enhance the production of infectious mhvs, to levels about 5-fold above those generated by control sirnas."
pmc3323231,"in a study on severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  caused by the coronavirus, 29 analyzed sars sequences from 20 individual sars patients showed a higher variation frequency in the s gene compared to previous reports. variations were detected in four participants, suggesting the possible existence of sars-cov quasispecies in acute infection. the study also identified some new variant sites in the s gene, including a nonsynonymous change observed at position a1023g within the heptad repeat  hr  domains, which are important for virus entry. however, the limitation of clinical sample collection and difficulty in directly amplifying full-length s genes from raw clinical samples restricted further extensive study for dynamic mutant distributions of the virus. the study observed the coexistence of sars-cov sequences with and without substitutions and time-dependent variation profiles in some patients. this suggests that the genetic variation of sars-cov remains limited in relation to many other rna viruses such as hiv-1, hcv, and mhv, possibly preventing persistent long-term mutant development in vivo as occurs in chronic rna viral infections. the study also reported that some modules in the s protein remain conserved, e.g., the fusion-important hr domains. although some variations were detected, no obvious correlation exists between mutation and clinical disease manifestation from the limited data reported here. the study noted that the genetic variation of sars-cov remains limited in relation to many other rna viruses such as hiv-1, hcv, and mhv. the probable reason is that sars-cov only causes an acute, self-limited infection, which may prevent persistent long-term mutant development in vivo as occurs in chronic rna viral infections."
pmc3911702,"the authors identified a multitude of mirnas, including mir-9, that were upregulated with oc43 n expression and tnf-α treatment. this finding suggests that oc43 n interacts with cellular rnas beyond just the viral genome. the authors found that the oc43 n protein binds mir-9 and prevents its functionality via this interaction. this finding indicates that oc43 n is interfering with mir-9's negative regulation of nfkb1 translation. the authors observed an increase in both nfkb1 and mir-9 transcription upon stimulation in oc43-infected cells, but oc43 n continues to bind mir-9, preventing inhibition of nfkb1 translation. this finding suggests that oc43 potentiates nfkb1 activation. the authors propose a model in which oc43 n prevents negative regulation of nfkb1 expression by binding mir-9, which is basally expressed, and preventing its control of nfkb1 mrna. this finding provides insight into the mechanism by which oc43 n is interacting with the nf-κb pathway. the authors recognize that n is binding other cellular rnas besides mir-9, indicating that its interaction with cellular rnas is not limited to mir-9. this finding suggests that the contact between n and cellular rnas may be inadvertent."

pmc3589666,"the intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in the development and maturation of the gut and immune system in neonates. alterations in the intestinal microbiota, such as decreased diversity and overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, predispose the intestine to inflammation and increase the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis  nec . the use of antibiotics in neonates can lead to long-lasting consequences, including alterations in the intestinal microbiota and increased risk of nec. intestinal inflammation and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor  tnf  and interleukin  il -1, are increased in patients with nec. commensal healthy bacteria, such as lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and streptococcus thermophilus, play a role in cytoprotection of the enterocyte and intestinal mucosa and help maintain a normal intestinal flora in neonates, thereby decreasing the incidence of nec. risk factors for bacterial translocation, such as abnormal intestinal colonization and alterations in the intestinal permeability, are associated with increased risk of nec and other complications, such as bloodstream infections. the use of histamine 2  h2  blockers and maintenance of an acidic gastric ph less than 3.0 in neonates less than 1500 g are associated with increased risk of nec and bacterial translocation. maintaining a gastric ph greater than 4.0 decreases the incidence of nec and is strongly correlated with higher gastric enteric bacterial colony counts."
pmc3428760,"among children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, young age  <6 months , low birth weight  <2.5 kg , apnea, severe retractions, room air oxygen saturation <85%, and inadequate oral intake are independently associated with a subsequent need for mechanical respiratory support. children hospitalized with bronchiolitis who have a rapid respiratory decline  breathing difficulties begin <1 day from presentation  are more likely to require mechanical respiratory support. maternal smoking during pregnancy is independently associated with bronchiolitis requiring mechanical respiratory support. rsv-a is more common in children requiring mechanical respiratory support on the day of admission but not necessarily more common overall among children requiring mechanical respiratory support. among children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, the subgroup of children with rapid respiratory decline may provide important insights for the future management of children with bronchiolitis."
pmc4485799,"the study identified two novel mechanisms by which interleukin-10  il-10  enhances antitumor cytotoxicity 1  cd8+  t cell responses in the plasmacytoma j558 tumor model   a  by inhibiting the expansion of highly suppressive cd4+ t cells and  b  by promoting t cell long-term persistence. the study demonstrated that il-10 deficiency significantly reduced the expression of il-27, a cytokine that induces t cell long-term persistence, in cd8+ t cells, resulting in a decrease in t cell persistence and a decrease in antitumor cytotoxicity. the study found that il-10 deficiency significantly increased the expression of the regulatory t cell marker foxp3, indicating a higher proportion of regulatory t cells in the tumor microenvironment, which may contribute to the decrease in antitumor cytotoxicity. the study revealed that il-10 deficiency significantly decreased the expression of the antitumor cytokine ifn-γ and the antitumor cytokine-inducing cytokine il-27, which further contributed to the decrease in antitumor cytotoxicity. the study showed that il-10 deficiency significantly reduced the expansion of highly suppressive cd4+ t cells, which may contribute to the decrease in antitumor cytotoxicity by allowing regulatory t cells to suppress antitumor t cell responses."
pmc3962368,"the current study found that severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome  sfts  virus viremia level is related to disease severity, with significantly higher levels in deceased patients compared to survivors. sfts infection causes tissue injury and organ damage, which can lead to elevated serum enzymatic markers and death. alt, ast, ldh, and ck were all elevated above the normal range especially during the acute phase of infection, and their peak levels in deceased patients were significantly higher than in survivors. the study found that three subsets of t cells  cd69+, hla-dr+, and ctla4+  were elevated in sfts-infected patients, but their changes happened at different phases of progression of the disease. cd69+ t cells  both cd8+ and cd4+  were elevated during the acute phase of infection with significant activation in deceased patients compared to survivors at time points of the peak viremia. hla-dr+  a mhc class ii cell surface receptor  and ctla4+  a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily on the surface of helper t cells  t cells  both cd4+ and cd8+  were elevated during the recovery phase in survivors. both pro-inflammatory cytokines  such as il-6 and ifn-γ  and anti-inflammatory cytokines  such as il-10  were elevated in sfts-infected patients, and levels were dramatically higher in deceased patients, which is similar to reports by other groups. il-6 and il-10 were persistently elevated in deceased patients while levels of il-2, il-4, tnf-α, and il-17a were similar to normal healthy donors. the study found that viral load, plt, and key serum enzymes were measured concurrently over the critical acute phase of sfts after infection, and no further analysis to relate these dynamic changes to the severity and course of the disease was reported in previous studies. the findings on the involvement of cd69+ as well as hla-dr+ and ctla4+ t cells"

pmc2918871,"the discovery of hcov-nl63 and other novel human coronaviruses does not necessarily represent a sudden increase in emerging infections by 'new' coronaviruses, as viral agents causing upper respiratory tract infections were isolated from patients and shown to be coronaviruses by electron microscopy in the early 1960s. molecular clock analysis, used to measure the evolutionary divergence of species, assumes a roughly constant substitution rate for a species' genome. the reliability of molecular dating is dependent on the validity of this hypothesis, and with an average substitution rate for coronaviruses estimated to be 10-4 substitutions per year per site, molecular dating has shown that hcov-nl63 has been present in the human population for centuries. cross-reactive antibody responses to other human coronaviruses, including hcov-nl63, have been reported, and this cross-reactivity is most likely due to the presence of cross-reactive antigenic epitopes of the coronaviruses. improved molecular and cell biology techniques have aided in identifying three 'new' human coronaviruses, improving our understanding of the classification of the coronaviruses. the assembly of a full-length infectious hcov-nl63 clone has also been reported, which will make the study of this virus easier, improving our understanding of the role of each of the proteins encoded by the hcov-nl63 genome. the discovery of these 'new' human coronaviruses, including hcov-nl63, has shown that only sars-cov has recently been introduced to the human population from an animal source, while hcov-nl63 has been circulating in humans for a while. this highlights the need to develop further molecular and cell biology techniques to make the sensitive and accurate detection of coronaviruses in clinical samples possible, as the prevailing view that they are only involved in mild respiratory tract infections needs to be further explored to elucidate the link, if any, between human coronaviruses and human diseases of the respiratory tract, the vascular system, the central nervous system, and the gastrointestinal tract."
pmc6957253,"a potential treatment for mers-cov is the use of neutralizing antibodies, either via convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies. severity of disease is linked to the prevalence of comorbidities, and the availability of donors with sufficiently high neutralizing antibody titer in convalescent plasma might be very limited. monoclonal antibodies could provide an alternative to convalescent plasma, as mab treatment in rabbits and marmosets reduced viral titer and load in lung tissue, and reduced mortality and morbidity was observed in a mers-cov mouse model. treatment with mabs reduced the occurrence of severe respiratory symptoms further than hyperimmune plasma did, combined with less gross pathology. the marmosets utilized in this study are outbred, and the significance of genetic factors or differences in immunology cannot be excluded, and when statistical tests were performed excluding the marmoset with no viral load in the respiratory tract, differences in viral load in the lobes of the lower respiratory tract between control and hyperimmune plasma-treated animals were still significant."
pmc4151056,"four monoclonal antibodies, 1c10, 2f10, 4g10, and 10e9, were generated and found to specifically recognize the messenger protein 1  msg1  of mycoplasma suis. western blot analysis revealed that the antibodies 4g10 and 10e9 recognized the linear epitope i268kdgene274, while antibody 1c10 recognized the epitope d291thgsvf297, and antibody 2f10 recognized the epitope l251clki255. epitope mapping using truncated fragments of msg1 expressed in e. coli revealed that the epitopes i268kdgene274 and d291thgsvf297 were conserved among all m. suis strain sequences available on ncbi, while the epitope l251clki255 was conserved in all m. suis strains. the study revealed that b cell epitopes on msg1 of m. suis are continuous and one epitope was conserved among all m. suis strain sequences available on ncbi. the study contributed to a deeper understanding of the antigenic structure of the msg1 protein and facilitated the development of diagnostic methods for detecting m. suis in blood and tissues."
pmc4865696,"the proposed technique for collecting multiple liver biopsies in rats and mice involves using a disposable biopsy punch through a laparotomic approach, which preserves the integrity of the collected samples and that of the tissue remaining within the animal. the technique developed in this study allows researchers to assess disease processes or treatment responses over time in the same subject, thereby reducing the number of animals needed for such studies. the proposed technique is simple to perform, despite the need to create an abdominal incision, and may overall be the least invasive of the invasive methods used to collect repeated liver biopsies. the use of multiple, survival surgeries is not ideal, but in this study, the appearance of the hepatic histology coupled with the fact that only 2 animals did not survive to the third and final collection supports the use of the current proposed method of tissue collection. some of the belgrade rats sustained dramatic weight losses, but these were directly related to the carbonyl iron diet and not to the surgical procedures, as the weights of the belgrade rats stabilized after the carbonyl diet was discontinued, and none of the other subjects developed diarrhea at any time during this study."

pmc4885082,"rcrevs, a type of virus that expresses reporter genes, have been developed for virus research in both applied and basic sciences. they are useful for identifying antivirals against viral infections using high-throughput screening settings, for monitoring viral infections in real time in vitro and in vivo, and for evaluating vaccination approaches. rcrevs can also be used for a genome-wide rnai screening for host factors required for virus replication. in addition, rcrevs can reveal the mechanism of viral genome replication and gene expression, as well as the sites of virus replication in real time using luciferase imaging. rcrevs can also help address scientific questions by providing multicolor imaging with high brightness in mammalian cells and tissues, and by using reporter genes with no intrinsic autoluminescence. however, the use of rcrevs is limited due to their attenuation in vivo imaging and the need for costly automated imaging equipment. nonetheless, the development of new reporter genes, such as gfp mutants, ""red-shifted"" analogs of luciferase, and variants of luciferase, can help overcome these limitations and provide more far-reaching benefits in virus research."
pmc1774570,"the authors report the first sequences of the orf4a/b region in clinical isolates of hcov-229e. both types of deletions, 2 or 118 nucleotides, of the orf4 gene only in cell culture-adapted hcov-229e viruses create a frame shift that introduces an early termination codon, either separating orf4 to orf4a and orf4b or resulting in a truncated orf4 a  fragment  hc-lp . the amino acid sequence of the hcov-229e orf4 protein is highly conserved among clinical isolates, suggesting that the protein plays an important role during in vivo infection. molecular clock analysis with the neighbor-joining method, kimura distances, and a bootstrap of 1000 replicates indicates that the divergence between the current clinical isolates and the early isolates most likely represents genetic drift over 20–30 years of evolution. the authors report that the experimental data strongly support the hypothesis that a separation of a formerly single orf4 into orf4a and orf4b occurred upon adaptation of hcov-229e to cell culture."

pmc4313627,"during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic, border screening was unsuccessful due to low sensitivity and a substantial proportion of infectious persons not being detected. influenza virus causes explosive outbreaks despite its relatively low infectivity, and screening sensitivity is low, resulting in a substantial proportion of infectious persons not being detected at the border. modeling studies suggest that border screening would not significantly delay the commencement of an epidemic or reduce the total number of cases, as allowing only a small number of cases to enter would result in an epidemic of the same size as if travel restrictions were not in place. communication with incoming travelers, such as informational videos, posters, and health alert notices, can be a useful mechanism to encourage self-reporting and early identification of case-patients. during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic, communication measures at borders, such as health alert notices  t-hans , provided a small positive influence on health care-seeking behavior among incoming travelers. however, the effectiveness of communication measures at borders is limited, and more effective disease control measures in the community, such as early isolation and quarantine of contacts, should be the focus of resource allocation."

pmc87870,"the npcr assay described in the study was able to detect a variety of serologically different ccv strains, including tn449, nvsl, sa4, and an australian field strain  uwsmn-1 , as well as intermittent viral shedding up to 13 days post-challenge. the npcr assay was found to be approximately 4 × 104 times more sensitive than electron microscopy, with a detection limit of 25 tcid50 per g of unprocessed feces, compared to the reported detection limit of approximately 106 particles per g of unprocessed feces for electron microscopy. the ability of the npcr assay to detect viral shedding beyond the detection limit of viral isolation demonstrates the increased sensitivity of the assay over viral isolation techniques in the detection of field isolates. the npcr assay was able to detect ccv shedding from day 4 post-challenge up to day 9 by virus isolation, whereas intermittent viral shedding up to day 13 was detected by the npcr assay. the phylogenetic analysis of the npcr assay products revealed that the australian field strain  uwsmn-1  forms a discrete branch which is intermediate between those of the typical ccvs and focvs, suggesting that the s genes of this strain may have arisen by homologous recombination between ccvs and focvs. however, further investigation, including sequencing of other regions from these isolates and viral isolation, is required to confirm this notion."
pmc5075966,"the study revealed that p2x7r is involved in cii-induced atp release from dcs, and its activation enhances the release of extracellular atp and intensifies stimulation of atp, which in turn enhances the expression of p2x7r. the study found that cii-induced p2x7r activation promotes the differentiation of th17 cells via its pro-inflammatory role, and its inhibition attenuated cii-induced joint damage of cia mice. the study demonstrated that p2x7r signaling facilitates the development of the cii-induced differentiation of th17 cells, and its inhibition attenuated cii-induced increase in il-17a in vivo and in vitro. the study showed that the mrnas levels of rorγt and rorα, essential for th17 cell differentiation, were profoundly elevated following the stimulation of p2x7r by cii. the study revealed that p2x7r is a necessary component for the cii-induced differentiation of th17 cells in both in vivo and in vitro."
pmc5192384,"the study identified several interferon-induced protein  isg  proteins, including isg15, isg2, isgl, mx1, and mx2, that were significantly upregulated in both the yn13-infected group and the yn144-infected group, suggesting that these isg proteins may participate in the process of resisting pedv infection. however, no significant change was found in isg1 and isg2 in the two pedv-infected groups, indicating the need for further investigations to elucidate the upregulation of these isg proteins. the study found that α-tubulin and β-tubulin were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in both the yn13-infected group and the yn144-infected group, which is consistent with the findings of other authors who reported that α-tubulin was upregulated during infection of some other coronaviruses, such as transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus  tgev  and severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars , while the downregulation of β-tubulins in host cells was also found during the infection of porcine circovirus type 2. the study identified that most heat shock protein  hsp  90-identified proteins, including hsp90β1, hsp90β1a, hsp70, hsp40α1, and hsp40c10, were significantly upregulated in the yn13-infected group but were downregulated in the yn144-infected group, indicating that hsp90 and hsp70 may possess a positive effect on the replication of pedv, while the downregulation of these hsps may inhibit the replication of yn144. the study found that the translation of most subgenomic messenger rna  sgmrna  transcripts requires eukaryotic initiation factor 4f  eif4f , which is composed of eif4a, eif4e, and eif4g. the study also found that eif4g1 was upreg"

pmc3999320,"comparison of the ica kit with other detection methods  the prevalence rates of rotaviruses and adenoviruses detected by the ica kit were comparable to those reported in previous studies. the overall agreement rates among the four methods were 91.5% for rotaviruses and 85.5% for adenoviruses. the discordant results observed among the different assays could be explained by differences in the ability of each assay to detect variable viral burdens in stool samples. however, the possibility of false-positive findings and different detectability for adenovirus subtypes among different adenovirus detection methods should be considered. cross-reactivity and analytical reactivity  no cross-reactivity was observed for any of the 36 viruses, 30 bacteria, and two fungi tested. the ica kit could detect every adenovirus type tested, whereas the seeplex dv assay  mrt-pcr  could detect only adv40 and 41. the different results observed among the different assays could be because the antibodies used in the ica and elisa reagents could detect all types of adenovirus capsid antigens, whereas specific adenovirus types could be detected by using pcr according to the primers used. repeatability and limit of detection  the repeatability and reproducibility of the ica kit for rotaviruses and adenoviruses were 100%. the discordant rate between the ica kit and mrt-pcr was similar to that reported in previous studies  2.1-4.3% . the ica kit could detect rotavirus and adenovirus in diluted culture supernatants at a dilution of 1 16 for rotavirus and 1 64 for adenovirus, whereas real-time pcr and mrt-pcr could detect at a dilution of 1 1024. however, similar to the rotavirus results, 15 stool samples were positive for adenovirus when tested by using the ica kit, but negative when tested by using elisa, real-time pcr, and mrt-pcr. this finding also suggests a high probability of false-positive findings"
pmc4670481,"trim21, a receptor for antibodies, is activated during viral infection and has two functions  eliminating viruses through an antibody-dependent mechanism called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity  adcc  and activating pro-inflammatory signaling. trim21 is effective against non-enveloped viruses, such as adenovirus, and can provide systemic protection against viral infection. trim21 synergistically interacts with three classes of antibodies, igg, igm, and iga, and its biology is promiscuous in its antibody binding. trim21 is important for preventing excessive inflammation during viral infection, and its activation thresholds for downstream ubiquitin-dependent processes are regulated. trim21 may contribute to cross-presentation of viral peptides on major histocompatibility complex class i molecules, resulting in the recruitment of cytotoxic lymphocytes to the infected cell, and it may intersect with other intracellular receptors specific for other immune serum proteins with antiviral functions."
pmc2258929,"the study found that infection by momlv pseudovirions bearing jsrv env was strongly inhibited by bafilav, suggesting that jsrv entry is ph dependent. nh4cl and chloroquine had less effect on jsrv pseudovirion infection than on classical ph-dependent viruses, possibly due to stable virus-cell complexes in endocytic vesicles. low ph conditionally overcomes a bafilav block on jsrv infection, but rescue of bafilav block requires preincubation of virus-bound cells. dynamin is required for jsrv entry, indicating that a dynamin-dependent, caveola-mediated endocytosis pathway is involved in jsrv entry. low ph does not readily inactivate jsrv pseudovirions, suggesting that additional events besides low ph are involved in jsrv fusion and entry, possibly a two-step fusion mechanism similar to that of aslv."

pmc3424113,"this study found that ort, a bacterial pathogen causing airsacculitis in broilers, was isolated and identified in china. the mortality rate in broilers infected with ort was 50%, which is higher than the previously reported rates of 20-30%. co-infection of broilers with ort and avian influenza virus h9n2 resulted in a mortality rate of 70%, which is significantly higher than the mortality rate of 30% in broilers infected with ort alone. the current study is the first to report co-infection of broilers with ort and h9n2 aiv, which could be associated with the outbreak of broiler airsacculitis in china. the study suggests that further investigation of the resistance and pathogenesis of ort is urgently needed, as ort infections have been occurring frequently in china and can lead to high mortality and economic loss."
pmc2863812,"this study demonstrated that low-ph conditions can induce baculovirus  bv  of acinetobacter calcoaceticus  acv  to enter sf9 insect cells by direct fusion with the cell surface. this finding is significant as it suggests that bv can infect sf9 cells through an endocytosis-independent pathway. the study revealed that the infection via direct membrane fusion induced by low ph is myosin-like protein dependent and microtubule independent. this finding challenges the conventional understanding that bv infection in mammalian cells is mediated by the myosin-like proteins and microtubules. the study showed that after fusion with the cell membrane, the myosin-like proteins aid the transport of the nucleocapsids to the nucleus while intact microtubules are not necessary for this process. this finding challenges the conventional understanding that bv infection in mammalian cells is mediated by the microtubules. the study found that when the entry pathway was modified with the low-ph trigger, bv of acmnpv could infect both hepg2 and hela cells with a significantly improved transduction rate, even in the presence of nh4cl. this finding suggests that the low-ph trigger could improve the transduction rate of bv in other mammalian cells, making it easier to transduce mammalian cells and potentially expand the transduction range. the study showed that the nonenveloped nucleocapsids were microinjected into hepg2 cells, and at 6 h p.i., the stained nucleocapsids were observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating that the modifications of the nucleocapsids in the endosomes were not essential for bv infection in insect cells. this finding challenges the conventional understanding that bv infection in mammalian cells is mediated by the endosomal modification of the nucleocapsids."
pmc4488726,"two bacterial proteins, mab and mav, were identified as functional homologues of the mammalian interferon-inducible protein  ifitm3  with antiviral activity against influenza virus. mab and mav ifitms, like ifitm3, are palmitoylated in mammalian cells, and the level of palmitoylation correlates with their antiviral activity. mab and mav ifitms, like ifitm3, are partially localized to cathepsin-b-positive cellular compartments, but the level of co-localization is lower than that of ifitm3. the co-localization of mycobacterial ifitms with cathepsin-b-positive compartments suggests that the strong co-localization seen between mycobacterial ifitms and ifitm3 in cells is indeed due to an interaction between these proteins, since mycobacterial ifitms and ifitm3 do not localize to precisely the same compartments when expressed in isolation. further study of the bacterial ifitms may provide greater understanding of ifitm3 post-translational regulation and antiviral activity."
pmc4817249,"a new mutation, n63y, in the vp3 protein of human cytomegalovirus  cmv  was identified in fecal samples from mice. the n63y mutation in cmv resulted in increased virulence and replication of the virus in mice, as evidenced by increased tissue damage and viral titers in infected mice. the n63y mutation did not alter cmv binding to human or murine car, but did result in decreased binding to sulfated glycans and gags, which are components of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. the n63y mutation did not affect cmv growth or virion structure, as assessed by single-cycle growth curve assays and agarose overlay plaque formation assays, respectively. the n63y mutation did not affect cmv homing to the liver, as assessed by fecal virus quantification in mice orally infected with cmv variants. the n63y mutation did not affect cmv homing to the spleen, as assessed by fecal virus quantification in mice orally infected with cmv variants. the n63y mutation did not affect cmv homing to heart tissue, as assessed by fecal virus quantification in mice orally infected with cmv variants. the n63y mutation did not affect cmv homing to muscle tissue, as assessed by fecal virus quantification in mice orally infected with cmv variants. the n63y mutation did not affect cmv homing to the liver in mice, as assessed by liver tissue collection and histopathology assays."

pmc3389303,"pi4k enzymes and their product lipid, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate  ptdins4p , play a crucial role in the replication of multiple different rna viruses, including picornaviruses, hepatitis c virus  hcv , and dengue virus. ptdins4p lipids are required for viral rna synthesis and serve as a panviral target for antiviral therapy, as they are produced by viruses during replication and are essential for their propagation. viruses hijack the host cell's ptdins4p lipid biosynthetic machinery by interacting with and recruiting host proteins, such as the acetyl-coa carboxylase 3  acc3  protein, which is involved in viral replication and is recruited by viruses through their 3a proteins. inhibition of ptdins4p lipid production or disruption of the interaction between viral proteins and ptdins4p lipids can effectively inhibit viral replication, as shown in studies using picornaviruses and hepatitis c virus. understanding the roles of ptdins4p lipids in viral replication may also shed light on their functions in eukaryotic and prokaryotic rna metabolism, as these lipids are involved in the regulation of viral rna synthesis and may contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis in host cells."
pmc6264369,"patchouli alcohol, a natural compound found in the leaves of the plant piper methysticum  pepppermint , displays significant inhibition against the influenza a virus h2n2 subtype, both in vitro and in vivo studies. this anti-influenza activity is mediated via interference with the neuraminidase  na  function that cleaves the α-glycosidic bond between sialic acid and glycoconjugate. patchouli alcohol exhibits anti-influenza a virus h2n2 subtype activity through inhibition of virus replication, as well as through reduction of mortality and weight loss in a mouse model. computational studies reveal that the interaction energy between patchouli alcohol and the respective residues at the na active site is a significant finding in the study of the anti-influenza a virus h2n2 subtype. further mechanistic studies are needed to support the potential use of patchouli alcohol in the treatment of influenza a virus infectious disease."
pmc4589665,"a new approach for assembly and linkage of viral genomes from metagenomes has been developed, which overcomes challenges associated with low similarity to viral sequences in databases, uneven coverage of target genomes, and intrapopulation diversity or sequencing errors leading to incomplete contigs. this approach consists of four steps  assembly, identification, linkage, and finalizing. the assembly step involves selecting an assembler suited for the sequencing technique and read length, and making use of paired-end information to combine assemblies or assemblers to increase the length of contigs. the identification step involves using motif search to detect conserved regions and remote homology detection methods to link fragments. the finalizing step involves determining the order of fragments by generating overlaps between contigs, and editing contig ends to improve wrong assemblies and facilitate subsequent gap closing with a different assembler. the success of assembly and linkage depends on the presence of sufficient sequencing data of the target genome, the quality of sample preparation and sequencing protocols, and the selection of an appropriate assembler and motif search methods. successful assembly and linkage require long contigs  >1 kb  produced by the assembly, as motif search and coverage and k-mer profile analysis perform better on long fragments due to the noise associated with the high numbers of features in case of k-mers or introduced by uneven coverage. to effectively use k-mer profiles, coverage profile binning, and motif search to link fragments, it is advisable to apply these methods only to well-assembled, long fragments. the development of efficient and dedicated metagenome assemblers that consider the characteristics of viromes and viral genomes is needed to directly recover full-length viral genomes from metagenomes. the approach has been successfully applied to recover full-length viral genomes from metagenomes, such as the complete genome of the gram-negative bacterium rickettsia prowazekii, which had an unresolvable 5' end. however, in some cases, even with sufficient sequencing data and coverage, viral genomes cannot be completely resolved in silico due to fragmentation of the rna in the original tissue,"
pmc6509364,"the study found that correctional institutions had the highest diagnosis rate and or of latent tuberculosis  ltbi  among contacts, but a lower treatment completion rate compared to schools. this highlights the need to establish a system for post-discharge control and continuous treatment for ltbi patients in correctional institutions, as well as in social welfare facilities and workplaces, particularly for individuals aged 35 years or older. the study identified that, unlike active tuberculosis  tb  patients, patients with ltbi have not been included in the target population for directly observed treatment  dot  or tuberculosis  tb  public-private mix model  ppm  recommended by the world health organization  who . this suggests the need to extend dot to include patients with ltbi to improve the completion rate of ltbi treatment. the study found that the general workplace had lower treatment initiation and completion rates of ltbi, which could be attributed to the unclear guidelines for the management of infected individuals in the workplace congregated settings. this highlights the need for a system to monitor and manage the treatment process in patients with ltbi aged 35 years or older in workplaces. the study found that, unlike the case of active tb patients, the completion rate of ltbi treatment was lower in individuals aged 35 years or older, and efforts should be made to enhance the early detection of the first patients with tb in this population. the study found that, unlike the case of active tb patients, patients with ltbi have not been included in the target population for information transfer about ltbi patients to the corresponding community health centers after discharge from congregated settings, which could lead to a lower treatment completion rate in patients with ltbi. this highlights the need to establish a system to transfer information about ltbi patients to the corresponding community health centers after discharge from congregated settings to raise the treatment completion rate in patients with ltbi."

pmc2958208,"in a study evaluating the pathogenesis of four different strains of swine-origin h1n1 influenza viruses in cynomolgus macaques, the severity of radiographic lesions ranged from mild in macaques infected with the circulating a/kawasaki/utah4/2009 virus to severe in those infected with the a/mexico/indre4487/2009 and a/california/4/2009 viruses. the study found that interstitial infiltration was present in 16% of macaques infected with the circulating a/kawasaki/utah4/2009 virus, 67% in each group of macaques infected with the a/mexico/indre4487/2009 and a/swine/mexico4108/2009 viruses, and 89% in macaques infected with the a/california/4/2009 virus. the study also demonstrated that macaques infected with the a/california/4/2009 virus had the highest average radiographic score at all time points, with the onset of radiographic changes occurring on day 1 and peak severity on day 8 after infection, followed by a trend of decreasing radiographic scores to day 14 after infection. the study found that both the a/mexico/indre4487/2009 and a/swine/mexico4108/2009 viruses led to detectable radiographic changes on day 1 after infection, with similar patterns of radiographic changes, and differences between the two viruses were not statistically significant. the study showed that time-course thoracic radiographs have scientific value as a noninvasive refinement methodology for evaluating the pathogenesis of emerging respiratory pathogens, as they allowed for the characterization of the onset of disease, peak severity, and partial to complete resolution of radiographic changes, as well as correlations to clinical presentations."
pmc4409105,"the study found that fgfr1 silencing by sirna significantly increased iav replication, while lentivirus-mediated fgfr1 overexpression effectively reduced iav replication, indicating that fgfr1 plays a suppressive role in iav pr8 and h5n1 replication. the study showed that fgfr1 knockdown notably elevated virus entry efficiency during the early stages of iav infection, and further demonstrated that fgfr1 could inhibit virus internalization, which indicated that host cells may have evolved a specific strategy of utilizing plasma membrane as a barrier to block influenza virus entry. the study found that both fgfr1 protein expression and kinase phosphorylation levels were downregulated by iav infection, which may be related to the pathogenesis of influenza virus-induced disease. the study revealed that the inhibition of fgfr1 phosphorylation with a selective inhibitor pd173074 enhanced iav replication, indicating that fgfr1 suppressed iav replication probably by inhibiting viral internalization, but it remains unclear whether fgfr1 was implicated in other steps of the iav life cycle. the study showed that fgfr4 knockdown had no significant effect on inhibiting pr8 and h5n1 virus replication, while fgfr1 not fgfr4 remarkably suppressed pr8 and h5n1 virus replication, suggesting that fgfr1, not fgfr4, plays a role in inhibiting iav replication."

pmc5095390,"a mathematical model developed by the authors shows that a transmissible vaccine, which allows infection transmission among hosts, can significantly facilitate efforts to control and eradicate infectious diseases, particularly in cases where the infectious disease is not excessively transmissive. the model reveals that the fractional reduction in vaccination effort required to eradicate an infectious disease increases with the r0  basic reproductive number  of the vaccine and decreases with the r0 of the disease. this means that the closer the r0 of the vaccine to that of the disease, the greater the reduction in direct vaccination effort required for disease eradication. even in cases where a transmissible vaccine does not allow an infectious disease to be eradicated, it can still significantly reduce disease incidence, particularly in cases where the infectious disease is not excessively transmissive. simulations and numerical analyses show that under conditions where the model predicts a traditional, non-transmissible vaccine would fail to eradicate the disease, eradication occurred in only 2.4% of simulations. in cases where the model predicts vaccine transmission would reduce infection rates but fail to completely eradicate the disease, simulations showed vaccine transmission reduced the number of infected individuals by 61.8% relative to a non-transmissible vaccine and resulted in disease eradication in 39.2% of simulations. the models developed by the authors are simplifications designed to estimate the potential benefits of weakly transmissible vaccines. further generalization to evaluate the more nuanced biology of real populations, including spatial structure, heterogeneities in host populations, imperfect vaccines, and vaccine and disease evolution, will ultimately be required to circumscribe the conditions under which transmissible vaccines will provide benefits that exceed their potential risks. the authors suggest that even weakly transmissible vaccines can facilitate efforts to control and eradicate infectious diseases and that these vaccines may provide a safe and effective tool in the battle against infectious disease, particularly in cases where direct vaccination of a significant portion of the population is excessively costly or even impossible in many cases. the authors suggest that the potential for evolutionary reversion to wild-type virulence outweighs the potential benefits of transmissible vaccines, but that new developments in"

pmc6261820,"this study demonstrates that tgev infection activates both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptotic pathways in infected cells, as evidenced by the combined inhibition of pan caspase and aif blocking apoptosis. the study shows that tgev-induced apoptosis involves the translocation of aif from the mitochondria to the nucleus, which is mediated by parp-1 and ros accumulation. the study indicates that parp-1 and ros play crucial roles in tgev-induced apoptosis, as parp-1 inhibition reduces aif translocation, and ros accumulation attenuates aif translocation. the study reveals that p53 mediates the transcription of aif and induces aif translocation to the nucleus, which may be mediated by p53 activation and ros accumulation. the study provides further insight into the mechanism of tgev-induced cell death, as it shows that tgev infection activates a caspase-independent cell death pathway mediated by aif, parp-1, and ros, in addition to the caspase-dependent pathway."
pmc4558490,"mers-cov entry and replication are mediated by the viral structural protein e and accessory proteins 3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b. these proteins are difficult to study due to their low expression level and low molecular weight, but they have been identified as essential targets for anti-viral therapeutics. 2. the chloropyridine ester ce-5, previously identified as an inhibitor of sars-cov, also inhibits mers-cov 3clpro, which is involved in the inhibition of ifn production and works as a strong inhibitor of type 1 ifn by inhibiting dsrna recognition by cellular rig-i-like helicases. 3. the rna-binding domain of 4a, which binds dsrna and does not allow it to bind to the rna-binding domain of rig-i-like helicases, thereby inhibiting the anti-viral signaling pathway, is a key residue involved in the binding of rna to the rna-binding domain in 4a. 4. mycophenolic acid, cyclosporin a, ifnα, and ifnβ effectively inhibit mers-cov replication, and ribavirin has previously been used against sars-cov with increased efficiency when cotreated with ifnα2b. 5. the mers-cov e protein, which is involved in viral assembly, budding, and intracellular trafficking, can also be targeted for anti-viral activity. these findings have been confirmed through in vitro studies and the availability of drug-testing techniques has sped up the identification of new drugs and the confirmation of their anti-viral efficacy."
pmc6312525,"in a study investigating the use of phage display and panning method to identify antigens, a 96-well maxisorp plate was coated with 100 µg/ml of various antigens in pbs buffer at 4°c overnight. after washing with blocking buffer  2% bsa in pbs  at room temperature for 1 hour, 30 µl of pre-blocked phage supernatant  typically containing 1010-1011 cfu  was added to each well for 1 hour at room temperature to allow binding. after four rounds of panning, single colonies were picked and identified by using hrp conjugated mouse anti-m13 antibody  ge healthcare life sciences, pittsburg, pa  for soluble protein production and purification. in the production and purification of a single-domain soluble protein, the pcom3x phagemids containing the vnar binders were transformed into hb2151 e. coli cells. the formed colonies were pooled for culture in 2 l of 2ty media containing 2% glucose, 100 µg/ml ampicillin at 37°c until the od600 reaches 0.8-1.0. the culture media was then replaced with 2ty media containing 1 mm iptg  sigma , 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and shaken at 30°c overnight for soluble protein production. the bacterial pellet was spun down and lysed with polymyxin b  sigma  for 1 hour at 37°c to release the soluble protein, and the supernatant was harvested after lysis and purified using a histrap column  ge healthcare  using akta. in a study investigating the binding kinetics of a single-domain soluble protein, pe38-b6-his was buffer exchanged in pbs buffer after purification. the binding kinetics of pe38-b6-his was measured with fortebio octet red96 located at the biophysics core in the national heart, lung, and blood institute. pe38"
pmc4125720,"the study reported a rational approach for discovering novel aromatase inhibitors with a robust htrf-based aromatase assay, which demonstrated a reasonable s/b ratio and z′ factor. the study identified two chemical classes of compounds, flavone derivatives and diterpenoid alkaloid natural products, as aromatase inhibitors, with the most potent compound, xhn27, belonging to the former class. the study suggested that the isoflavone ring skeleton may not be suitable for the development of aromatase inhibitors due to its poor inhibition potency, as demonstrated during molecular docking. the study delineated the structure-activity relationship for the most potent compound, xhn27, during the molecular docking study. the study suggested that xhn27 may be a competitive aromatase inhibitor due to its interactions with aromatase, including a hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bond, and π-cation connection, as observed during docking."
pmc4210292,"the study identifies a novel and surprising feature of mers-cov entry, which is the activation of viral envelope glycoproteins by furin at two distinct sites during virus entry. the study shows that furin-mediated activation of viral envelope glycoproteins during entry is not an efficient process for mers-cov, as the cleavage events at both sites are not efficient, and sequential activation, first at s1/s2 and then at s2′, is important for optimal virus entry. the study reveals that mers-cov can be activated by a wide variety of proteases, including cathepsins, trypsin-like serine proteases, and furin-like proteases, suggesting that drug combinations that target these proteases may be potential antiviral candidates. the study demonstrates that mers-cov-activating proteases, such as furin, are important factors that modulate susceptibility to mers-cov infection, as inhibition of these proteases significantly reduces infectivity by mers-cov in various cell types. the study highlights the importance of proteolytic activation of envelope glycoproteins in virus tropism and pathogenicity, as it offers insights into important features of enveloped viruses, such as tropism and pathogenicity."
pmc2224459,"the study identifies mutations in the viral rna polymerase  3dpol  of the enterovirus cvb3, which confer resistance to the nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors amiloride and eipa. the study shows that amiloride-resistant cvb3 isolates have mutations in either the s299t or the a372v position in 3dpol, or a combination of both mutations and a d48g mutation in the 2a protein, which confers resistance to both amiloride and eipa. the study finds that the mutations have different effects on resistance to amiloride in multiple replication cycles or in a single replication cycle, suggesting potential synergistic effects of both mutations in a single replication cycle for the combination of a372v and d48g mutations. the study demonstrates that amiloride-resistant cvb3 isolates have mutations close to the active center of cvb3 polymerase, indicating that amiloride and eipa may act as nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors, a novel mechanism of activity for these compounds. the study suggests that the location of mutations conferring cvb3 resistance to amiloride and eipa, close to the active center of cvb3 polymerase, may reflect differences in the mechanism of picornavirus release, as the effects of eipa on cvb3 and human rhinovirus release observed in the study may reflect differences in their release mechanisms."
pmc4420971,"the study found that cloth masks should not be recommended for healthcare workers  hcws  due to the significantly higher rates of infection compared to medical masks. the study also found that cloth masks may potentially cause an increase in infection risk for hcws due to the poor filtration capacity, self-contamination through repeated use and improper doffing, and increased moisture retention. the study confirmed the protective effects of hand hygiene against laboratory-confirmed viral infection in this setting, but mask type was an independent predictor of clinical illness, even adjusted for hand hygiene. the study suggests that medical masks may be protective against respiratory infection, but the magnitude of difference raises the possibility that cloth masks cause an increase in infection risk for hcws. the study recommends that infection control guidelines be updated about cloth mask use to protect the occupational health and safety of hcws, as cloth masks should not be recommended, particularly during emergency, infectious/respiratory disease, and intensive care wards."
pmc5402733,"rats anesthetized with co2 maintain normal circadian rhythms of melatonin, tfa, potassium, glucose, corticosterone, lactate, and leptin, while rats anesthetized with isoflurane exhibit disrupted circadian rhythms and increased levels of these hormones. isoflurane anesthesia in rats causes hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and a shift in the insulin peak, with a marked hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia 8 hours prior to rats anesthetized with co2. co2 anesthesia preserves normal physiologic circadian rhythms and blood levels of melatonin, tfa, potassium, glucose, corticosterone, lactate, and leptin, while isoflurane anesthesia disrupts these rhythms and increases levels of these hormones. rats anesthetized with isoflurane exhibit a marked hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, with a shift in the insulin peak, and a significant reduction in potassium levels for most time points and a 12-hour shift in the insulin peak compared to rats anesthetized with co2. co2 anesthesia is superior to isoflurane anesthesia in rats for short procedures, as it preserves normal physiologic circadian function that contributes to animal health and wellbeing, and supports unambiguous scientific outcomes, unlike isoflurane anesthesia, which disrupts normal circadian rhythms and blood levels of melatonin, tfa, potassium, glucose, corticosterone, lactate, and leptin."
pmc2583970,"a study on cotton blue disease in brazil identified three divergent isolates associated with atypical symptoms. these isolates have a coat protein similar to clrdv but distinct rdrp sequences and probably arose from recombination events between clrdv and an unidentified luteovirus. molecular taxonomic criteria for the luteoviridae suggest that these isolates represent a new species in the genus polerovirus. the study found that clrdv has a widespread distribution in brazilian states, with a low genetic diversity between the 23 samples analyzed. the analyses revealed that recombination events between clrdv and an unidentified luteovirus probably occurred in the three divergent isolates associated with atypical cbd symptoms. a phylogenetic analysis of the partial rdrp sequence and the coat protein  cp  region showed that the three divergent isolates share identities of approximately 70% and 97% with the corresponding sequences from the 20 analyzed clrdv isolates, respectively. the study suggests that the three divergent isolates should be considered as isolates of a new species in the genus polerovirus, in agreement with molecular taxonomic criteria for the luteoviridae family."
pmc2853198,"the study demonstrates that ex in chf activates the ace2 and ang- 1–7  axis of the brain ras, potentially leading to a decrease in ang ii and an increase in ang- 1–7  after ex. the study suggests that ex reduces hr in sham + ex and chf + ex rabbits, but does not affect other cardiac parameters, indicating that the benefits of ex in chf may be due to a peripheral vasodilatory effect. the study finds that the normalization of the balance between ace and ace2 in the brain after ex is a global effect observed in many brain nuclei, suggesting that this normalization is not a specific effect observed in specific brain nuclei. the study localizes ace in vascular endothelial cells in the rvlm, colocalizing with the endothelial marker cd31, while ace2 is colocalized with neurons staining positive for the neuronal marker neun. the study suggests that the imbalance between ace and ace2 in chf and its normalization after ex may be a global effect observed in many brain nuclei and regions, potentially due to the p38 mapk and erk1/2 signaling pathway being involved in ace upregulation and ace2 downregulation, as suggested by a previous study."
pmc2274789,"in a study on the effectiveness of a new disease surveillance system, the healthmap system, researchers found that it correctly classified 655 out of 778 reports over a one-month period, with an accuracy of 84%. this is a significant improvement over other sources, such as google news, which has an accuracy of 81%. the researchers also noted that the system currently relies heavily on google news, which leaves it biased toward english-speaking countries, but they plan to expand to other languages and data sources as resources permit. in addition to improving accuracy, the researchers are working on expanding the system's geographic coverage and improving its ability to cover a broad range of pathogens, limit noise, detect outbreaks early, and accurately characterize alerts in each dimension of classification. the researchers also plan to conduct a usability observation study to gather feedback from their target demographic on priority features and improve the healthmap user interface. the study also noted that the value of the healthmap system lies in its ability to extract useful, customizable messaging and views from a mass of unstructured data, and that as more people use the system, and further significant outbreaks unfold in the global disease ecosystem, will be known the true potential of the software, and how best to improve it."
pmc4774695,"the recombinant adenoviruses carrying capsid protein-coding gene of fmdv o/ind/r2/75 were successfully generated and amplified to a high titer. the expression level of the target protein was not significantly correlated to the virus titer. the growth kinetics of the recombinant adenoviruses was similar to those of previous studies, and the virus titer decreased up to 10-fold at 4°c and 21-fold at 37°c after 60 h of incubation. the maximum growth of the recombinant adenoviruses was recorded during the first 48 h, and the virus titer decreased later on, possibly due to the unavailability of sufficient healthy cells for a further round of virus replication. the recombinant adenoviruses exhibited stability at 37°c for 60 h with a slight decrease in the titer, and the dad5 was less stable at 37°c compared to the recombinant adenoviruses, while had5/p1-2ab3bcm was more stable at 4°c as compared to had5/p1-2ab3bcwt."
pmc109630,"tgev viral assemblies detected in infected swine testicular  st  cells include characteristic budding profiles, large spherical viral particles with an electron-dense internal periphery and a clear center, and smaller viral particles with a homogeneously dense internal core. the small viral particles contain an annular, dense internal structure, and both large and small viral particles coexist in the golgi complex of infected cells. the large virions are more abundant in the perinuclear region, which is rich in endoplasmic reticulum  er -associated elements. treatment with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole arrests the transport of viral particles beyond the golgi complex, preventing the formation of large annular virions with a very electron-dense periphery and a less dense center. treatment with the drug brefeldin a  bfa  disrupts the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi complex, leading to the formation of large cisternae with accumulation of large virions with an electron-dense periphery and a less dense center."
pmc6093444,"the pathways service at mgh is a new clinical rotation focused on clinical investigation inspired by former mgh residents who died in an avalanche. it aims to enable exploration of a single patient with a rare and difficult-to-diagnose disease, generate new insights into disease mechanisms, and reconnect biology to the bedside through molecular biology platforms. the pathways service has generated and tested hypotheses about potential unifying mechanisms from unexplained patients, resulting in clinical interventions, diagnostics, and basic research questions and experiments that further elucidate the nature of the patient’s presentation and underlying mechanism of disease. the tools of human investigation  thi  course, led by a physician-scientist with nih funding, introduces pathways for early career development, provides an overview of hypothesis generation and testing using various study designs, and teaches interpretation of the literature, presentation, writing, and research skills to prepare residents for leadership in their chosen fields. the bigelow service, comprised of 6 resident teams, emphasizes a team-based approach to clinical care and education by having 6 resident teams, each with 4 interns, a junior assistant resident, and 2 attending physicians overseeing the care of 16-18 patients. the interns share responsibility for all patients and rotate through a 4-day cycle of tasks. the leadership of the residency program has active research investigators, including physician-scientists in infectious diseases, who use patients on the clinical service to drive intellectual curiosity and provide a framework for investigating the unknowns. this critical mass of faculty prominently seen by residents can have a lasting impact on their subsequent career choices."
pmc5850077,"culture-based diagnostic tests for severe pneumonia are neither sensitive nor fast enough to guide precise and timely treatment, leading to empirical, suboptimal care for individual patients. the root cause of diagnostic limitations is our reliance on culture-based diagnostic tests that are neither sensitive nor fast enough to guide precise and timely treatment for individual patients. the ability to efficiently and precisely target antibiotics is an unmet critical need in the care of severe pneumonia in the icu, as even small delays translate into measurable increases in mortality. shotgun approaches, such as whole metacommunity shotgun sequencing of dna  metagenomics  or rna  metatranscriptomics , offer an unprecedented opportunity for ""hypothesis-free"" diagnostics, as they capture the wide microorganismal breadth and coding potential of pathogens with metagenomics and the functional activity of communities with metatranscriptomics. metagenomics-based diagnostic tests have to reach standard thresholds of scientific evidence rigor to be recommended for use, as demonstration of clinical efficacy for improving patient outcomes is the ultimate determinant for clinical adoption of any diagnostic test, regardless of its sophistication."

pmc5667810,"the recent enactment of the food safety modernization act  fsma  requires animal food manufacturers to identify and control animal food safety hazards due to the discovery of swine foodborne viruses, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  pedv , which was not traditionally controlled by on-farm biosecurity measures. the current study demonstrates widespread contamination of pedv occurred in an animal food manufacturing facility after pedv swine food production and was detected on most surfaces, including animal food-contact surfaces. some non-food contact swabs from a repetition were qpcr positive after a negative animal food was manufactured, although animal food tested was qpcr negative. this genetic material remained on boot due to inadequate cleaning after a previous replicate and was tracked then detected on the concrete floor. material collected from dust collection systems and sweepings should be collected and disposed instead of added to the product flow as per traditional measures due to the potential of possibly infectious pedv. the proposed mitigation technique of feed batch sequencing was not effective to reduce environmental contamination, although the potential impact of pedv contamination and importance to prevent virus entry in such facilities was better understood."
pmc4496485,"the stat3 family of proteins, also known as signal transducers and activators of transcription, play a crucial role in regulating the immune response, inflammation, cell proliferation, and differentiation, as well as in mediating host defense against virus infections. stat3 is constitutively activated in neoplastic cells and many viruses exploit the oncogenic effects of phosphorylated stat3  pstat3  to promote cell transformation and tumorigenesis. stat3 is involved in the regulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, either through transcriptional regulation of other cellular factors or through pathways independent of its role as a transcription factor. in viral infections, stat3 plays a significant role in the interplay between viruses and their hosts and functions as either a pro- or antiviral factor depending on the virus and host cell type involved. the seemingly contradictory roles of stat3 in viral infections raise questions about what factors determine the switch between pro- and anti-inflammatory functions of stat3, how viruses exploit stat3 signalling for their gene replication, and whether stat3 negatively or positively regulates type 1 interferon response depending on the virus type involved."
pmc1181615,"this study confirms and extends previous findings that γδ t cells mediate demyelination in mice infected with jhm. most importantly, nkg2d+ cells are critical for virus-induced demyelination and are consistent with previous results indicating a role for this receptor molecule in autoimmune diabetes. treatment with the anti-nkg2d monoclonal antibody results in diminished infiltration of macrophages and microglia into the white matter, suggesting that these cells play a central role in effecting demyelination. this study provides additional evidence that ifn-γ is critical for demyelination to occur and also is consistent with the notion that γδ t-cell activation in the jhm-infected mouse occurs via a mechanism, ligation of the nkg2d receptor, which does not involve recognition of a viral antigen. these results may be relevant for understanding the role of γδ t cells in multiple sclerosis and raise the possibility that γδ t cells have both regulatory and effector roles in the cns of affected humans."

pmc4997466,"in a study on the use of big data platforms for public health education and online surveillance in china, the authors found that the use of big data platforms for public health education and online surveillance is becoming increasingly popular in china due to the availability of large amounts of internet search data and the increasing prevalence of infectious diseases. the authors also identified 13 regions with higher average attention to the ebola outbreak in china from july 30 to september 14, 2014, and the spatio-temporal analysis suggested that the 15 days after the peak of the bdi and smi were critical periods for infectious diseases with imported risks, requiring the adoption of necessary health education interventions in these clustered regions. in the same study, the authors found that the highest bdi was observed in guangdong province, which has the largest number of internet users in china, and the highest average bdi in a province was also observed in guangdong, indicating that the opportunities brought about by china's booming economy may have induced overreaction by local netizens in this region. the authors also found that the highest average bdi in a city was observed in beijing, the political center of china, and the highest average bdi in a province and city was observed in shanghai, the economic center of china. in a study on the use of big data platforms for online surveillance and public health education in china, the authors found that online surveillance based on big data platforms can be an innovative approach to purposefully perform public communication and health education, which can help to avoid the occurrence of public panics and dispel rumors, especially in regions with higher average attention to the ebola outbreak. the authors also found that the absence of clinically characteristic data and detailed distribution information prevented the performance of in-depth correlative analysis in their study. in the same study, the authors found that the average bdi and smi were not calculated in their analysis due to the absence of deleted ebola-related blogs, and the average bdi and smi were not verified due to the absence of clinically characteristic data and detailed distribution information. the authors also found that their study only focused on chinese websites and netizens from the chinese mainland, which could not depict the public reaction from internet users of websites in english or other languages, such as twitter and facebook."
pmc2990816,"in a study by crawford et al., most patients with cancer and h1n1 infection presented with signs and symptoms of lung disease, including hypoxemia, dyspnea, and tachypnea, instead of just influenza symptoms. the authors recommend managing patients with severe h1n1 infection with a low tidal volume open-lung strategy of ventilation, with peep titrated based on fio2 to achieve adequate spo2 and low pplat. the authors found evidence of bacterial coinfection in 87% of fatal cases in their study, which might explain the high mortality rate in this group of patients, despite early antimicrobial therapy. the authors report that biochemical and hematological data could not discriminate h1n1 infection from sepsis of bacterial origin in this group of patients. autopsy results in the fatal cases in this population showed that the cause of death in all patients was extensive involvement of the lungs and alterations secondary to multiple organ failure in major organs such as kidney and liver, with patients presenting with severe dad associated with severe nb and alveolar hemorrhage."
pmc3180037,"ape1, an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 crd rnase, cleaves rna without the presence of divalent metal ions and prefers to cleave 3' of pyrimidines at ua, ug, and ca sites, especially in single-stranded regions or weakly paired regions of rna. ape1 cleaves rna in the presence of ca2+ ions, which are known as potent splicing enhancers/silencers, suggesting a possible role for ape1 in mrna splicing. pre-treatment of pre-mirnas with ape1 significantly reduces the ability of dicer to process these substrates in vitro, providing another dimension in which ape1 could potentially influence the biogenesis and hence the level of mirnas in cells. ape1 cleaves any rna when presented in vitro and weakly cleaves at uc, cu, ac, and au sites, although the likelihood of such specificity is low and it is likely that ape1-rna interaction is more tolerant towards different nucleotides than its interaction with an abasic dna. since all rna molecules tested possess bases, the likelihood of such specificity is low and it is likely that ape1-rna interaction is more tolerant towards different nucleotides than its interaction with an abasic dna, insights from the example of rnase a in recognition of its substrate, rna, suggest that ape1 cleaves only on the single-stranded regions or weakly paired regions of rna."
pmc4621204,"in a study from the people's republic of china, 81 cases of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  aecopd  were examined to investigate the respiratory infectious phenotypes and their relationships with length of stay  los  and the copd assessment test  cat  score. the study found that 38 cases were infected with viruses, 17 were infected with bacteria, and seven had both. the most common virus associated with aecopd was influenza virus, and the study detected five patients infected with human metapneumovirus and six patients infected with bocavirus for the first time. the study also found that coinfection with both viruses and bacteria resulted in longer los and higher cat scores compared to single infection or non-infection. the study found that the los of patients with aecopd ranged from 4.1 to 16.9 days, with coinfection resulting in the longest los and non-infection resulting in the shortest los. the study also found that cat scores were positively correlated with los during aecopd. the study found that respiratory viral infection played an important role in exacerbations of copd, as the two patients infected with influenza virus died during hospitalization. the study detected a wide range of bacterial species in samples from copd patients, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella. the study found no statistically significant difference in forced expiratory volume in one second  fev1  among patients with different respiratory infectious phenotypes. however, the study detected five patients infected with human metapneumovirus and six patients infected with bocavirus for the first time, providing a new insight into understanding the etiological agents in aecopd."
pmc3785410,"the new multiplex pcr-based microarray, rpm-ivdc1, allows for the simultaneous detection and characterization of multiple respiratory tract viral pathogens, including atypical viruses such as measles, rubella, and influenza type c, with improved analytical sensitivity compared to conventional detection methods. the new microarray design, with shorter detector tiles and a smaller number of tiles, increases hybridization efficiency and allows for strain-level identification of some pathogens, such as human metapneumovirus and coronavirus, while still providing type- or strain-level identification for common respiratory pathogens. the use of multiple conserved primer pairs targeting specific pathogens in the microarray primer mix, in combination with the high efficiency of the assay, enables improved detection of respiratory tract viral pathogens, particularly for respiratory syncytial virus, where only 5 of the 22 infections identified by the rpm method were detected by the reference assay. the results of this study demonstrate the potential for diagnosing infectious syndromes manifesting by similar symptoms caused by diverse etiological agents and the capability of rpm-ivdc1 for improving response capacity to epidemic outbreak and epidemic surveillance. however, the false-negative detection for respiratory syncytial virus should be addressed prior to clinical adoption, and further validation is required for the simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory tract viral pathogens using rpm-ivdc1 in the context of outbreak investigations or epidemic surveillance."

pmc3266138,"in both studies, self-collected nasopharyngeal  np  and throat swabs from patients with confirmed influenza a or b were able to accurately predict viral loads expected on the second measurement, with small and statistically insignificant differences between observed and predicted viral loads for both influenza a and b. in the household transmission study, viral loads determined from swabs taken at the second measurement by healthcare professionals were slightly higher on average than the expected values based on the random-effects regression model for both influenza a and b. in the household transmission study, the decline in viral loads over time for both influenza a and b was similar to that observed in the influenza resistance information study, where self-collected np and throat swabs from patients with confirmed influenza a or b were also able to accurately predict viral loads expected on the second measurement. in both studies, trends in viral loads for both influenza a and b were able to accurately and reliably be predicted from a log-linear model based on the first and third measurements. in both studies, the lower limit of detection  llod  and lower limit of quantification  lloq  for both influenza a and b were similar in both studies."
pmc3856409,"this study detected and characterized coronaviruses  covs  in ten different bat species in italy, including alpha-covs and beta-covs  2b and 2c lineages . the study found that group 2b beta-covs  mers-like covs  were detected only in lesser horseshoe bats, while alpha-covs were found in two samples collected from kuhl's pipistrelle. the study also identified 10 novel clade 2c beta-covs from kuhl's pipistrelle, common noctule, and savi's pipistrelle, which extends the current knowledge on this bat-cov clade with new sequences obtained from bats that have not been previously described as hosts of these groups of viruses. the relatedness of mers-cov to covs hosted at a high prevalence by pipistrellus spp. bats across europe and the occurrence of hku5 cov in bats of this genus from china highlights the possibility that pipistrellus spp. bats might be hosts of viruses closely related to mers-cov. the risk of coronavirus infection and respiratory disease in humans remains low, and bats should not be considered liabilities, especially given the vital ecosystem functions they perform, as these mammals are highly sensitive to anthropogenic habitat alterations, and their conservation status is often vulnerable or threatened, since these mammals are valuable ecological service accomplishers through their pest-controlling actions."
pmc2483710,"the incidence of laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis  tb  in taiwan has remained relatively stable, while the prevalence of definite diagnosis has increased gradually during recent years. this suggests that improved accuracy of diagnosis by healthcare facilities may have contributed to the stabilization of tb incidence. among the tb patients, most cases of tb infection in taiwan are males, which is consistent with previous studies that have noted gender differences in tb incidence and progression. however, no gender difference was observed in the number of days of delay in treatment. the current study revealed that more men than women experienced long delays in treatment. this gender difference may partly reflect epidemiological differences, including differences in exposure, infection risk, progression from infection to disease, socio-economic status, cultural factors, and quality of healthcare received. the study also found that long delays in treatment usually occurred in hospitals, possibly due to not all physicians being familiar with tb treatment, especially in hospitals with many specialists. to minimize treatment delays and disease transmission, the protocols for controlling tb at the hospital level must be strengthened, and nurses responsible for hospital tb control should be informed immediately after a laboratory diagnosis is confirmed. the study found that delayed treatment increases the risk of transmission, and improving the protocol for managing confirmed tb cases can minimize disease transmission. the possibility of multiple-drug resistant tb  mdr-tb  cannot be considered due to the lack of information in the data set, but based on reports from chest hospitals in taiwan, multidrug resistance occurred in 42.8% of retreated tb patients, and 1.8% of multidrug resistant isolates were found in new tb patients from january 2002 to june 2004. a recent report in may 2008 revealed that, among 215 patients with mdr-tb, 42.8% were fluoroquinolone-resistant. this treatment regimen of using fluoroquinolone before definite diagnosis of pulmonary tb might cause treatment delay and drug resistance. further studies are needed to examine the extent of fluoroquinolone-resistance in patients with long treatment delays."
pmc2168776,"a novel class of aav vectors, based on the aav2 serotype, outperforms existing aav vectors in terms of generating antigen-specific t cell and antibody responses to hiv-1 antigens. this is due to the improved immunogenicity and gene transfer efficiency of these vectors, as demonstrated in both balb/c mice and hybrid mice. the aav2-based vectors also demonstrate a more potent and effective t cell response, compared to traditional vectors, as evidenced by the higher frequency of ifn-γ-producing cd8+ t cells and the presence of triple-cytokine-expressing cells with a memory phenotype. however, the initial activation of cd8+ t cells by antigen-presenting cells is dysfunctional following aav2 administration, as evidenced by the presence of substantial numbers of nonresponsive gag-specific t cells at peak and the absence of any memory phenotypes. the negative impact of aav on the ability of adc7 to boost cd8+ t cells is not observed with the b-cell response, which is boosted as much as 10-fold following adc7 administration. the study also suggests potential limitations of aav-based vaccines, such as the lack of effective cd8+ t cell response boosting following aav administration, and the need for further investigation into the mechanisms responsible for the dysfunctional cd8+ t cell response and confirmation of these findings in primates."
pmc434119,"inhibition of sars-cov-induced cpe in vero cells by sirna  the study found that out of the six vector-based sirnas, only two, psr02 and psr03, could effectively block sars-cov replication in vero cells. both of these sirnas target the rna polymerase, which suggests their potential as alternatives for vaccines against sars-cov. sequence conservation in different sars-cov strains  the target sequences of psr02 and psr03, which can efficiently inhibit sars-cov replication, are conserved in all the sars-cov strains published in the genbank database. this sequence conservation between different sars-cov strains may avoid the possibility that the sequence variation between different sars-cov strains may restrict sirna inhibitory effects. effectiveness of vaccine  vaccine is one of the most effective ways to interfere with viral infection. however, genetic mutation in the segments encoding the major antigenic proteins may pose potential problems for the development of effective vaccines due to sequence variation between different sars-cov strains. nonspecific double-stranded rnas  the study noted that exogenously introduced plasmids can lead to the generation of nonspecific double-stranded rnas, which in turn induce interferon production and inhibit viral replication to some extent. vector selection  the vector psr was selected as an sirna expression vector as it can be used to generate recombinant retroviruses, which has been shown to be effective in most cell lines and many primary cell types and provides great facility for further clinical application studies. rapid mutations  the variations of s protein among strains of sars-cov pose potential problems for the development of effective vaccines due to sequence variation between different sars-cov strains. rapid mutations in the segments encoding the major antigenic proteins may lead to antigenic protein sequence variation between different sars-cov strains, which may restrict sirna inhibitory effects. target sequence selection  in order to avoid the possibility that the sequence variation between different sars-cov strains may restrict sirna inhibitory effects, the target sequences were chosen with consideration given to sequence conservation between"

pmc4605413,"the study, which included over 2,000 patients from three different countries in southeast asia, provides an overview of the viral and atypical bacterial causes of acute respiratory infections in the region. the study found that viruses, particularly rhinoviruses, are much more common causes of acute respiratory infections than bacterial causes, but that the viral aetiology may vary in space and time. the study also found that infection with mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common atypical bacterium associated with acute respiratory infections, was associated with longer hospital stays and increased disease severity. the study highlighted the importance of establishing the burden and attributable fraction of acute respiratory infections caused by different pathogens, in order to improve management and prevention, and to guide antiviral treatment and reduce the inappropriate use of antimicrobials to limit the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. the study also emphasised the need for further research into the epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in southeast asia, given the increasing importance of respiratory viral infections in humans and animals, and the risks posed by such infections in light of the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars -cov, middle east respiratory syndrome  mers -cov, and avian influenza viruses a h5n1  and a h7n9 ."
pmc6905299,"in a study analyzing timeliness of notifications in the netherlands, it was found that legal changes and raised awareness during outbreaks successfully reduced notification and reporting delays by physicians and laboratories to the municipal public health services  ggd  and reporting delays to the national institute for public health and the environment  rivm . however, legal timeliness thresholds were not yet met for some diseases, such as bacterial gastrointestinal infections, and delays in disease identification and notification still need to be reduced, especially for measles and bacterial gastroenteritis. the authors recommend enhancing awareness among public and physicians during outbreaks and optimizing laboratory confirmation procedures to achieve early detection and reduce delays in the notification chain. in another study, it was found that notification delay, patient delay, and doctor delay differ by disease, as some diseases develop gradually, are nonspecific, or may need laboratory tests which are not available at every laboratory. during outbreaks, real-time information on new cases is needed to monitor the effect of control measures. the authors recommend including dates of doctor's consultation and laboratory test initiation in every notification to enable monitoring of causes of delay before laboratory confirmation and measuring the effect of raising awareness among public and physicians during outbreaks. in a third study, it was found that completeness rates for laboratory-confirmed hospitalized pertussis cases have been determined as low as 16.5-22% for cases 2 years and older and between 52-61% for children younger than 2 years. reporting completeness during the measles outbreak in 2013-2014 has been estimated as low as 9%, mainly due to patients not seeking medical care. the authors recommend improving insight into notification completeness at both local and national levels to improve the surveillance system. in a fourth study, it was found that missing data on the first date of consultation  tc  or of requesting laboratory testing  tl  is not available, as this is not legally required in some european union countries, such as sweden, the uk, and the united states. the authors recommend including these time points in every notification to enable monitoring of causes of delay before laboratory confirmation and measuring the effect of raising awareness among public and physicians during outbreaks. in a fifth study, it was found that"
pmc6627058,"seven phlorotannins  1-7  were isolated from ecklonia cava using column chromatography, and their structures were identified by spectral analysis. compounds 3 and 5 potentially inhibited tyrosinase catalytic reaction by blocking the entrance to the active site or forming complexes with the enzyme. compound 3 underwent simple reversible slow binding with tyrosinase, while compound 5 initially formed a complex with the enzyme quickly, followed by an isomerization step to create a new enzyme-type complex. these findings suggest that the flexible phloroglucinol backbone of phlorotannins containing this moiety bound easily into the active site of tyrosinase. molecular simulation study indicated that compounds 3 and 5 were docked at the active site of tyrosinase with autodock scores of −6.59 and −6.68 kcal/mol, respectively. both compounds used amino acids his85 and asn260 to maintain their connection with tyrosinase. the findings imply that compounds 2-phloroeckol  3  and 2-o- 2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl -6,6′-bieckol  5  might inhibit the production of melanin products. slow-binding inhibition analysis showed that the progress curves followed linear equations for both compounds, indicating a potential slow-binding mechanism."
pmc1560143,"the study found that respiratory syncytial virus  rsv  contributed significantly to influenza-like illness, particularly in young children, in four european countries during the 2002-2003 winter season. the study suggests that rsv should be reported in addition to influenza, as rsv has a significant impact on respiratory illness in europe. the study recommends that respiratory specimens collected as part of an influenza surveillance programme should also be tested for rsv. the study recommends that both combined nose and throat swabs and nasal pharyngeal aspirates are acceptable for rsv diagnosis. the study recommends that the application of molecular techniques such as real-time polymerase chain reaction  pcr  in the diagnosis of respiratory disease, including rsv, has been demonstrated and is recommended. the study recommends that further developments on the use of standardized methods and laboratory techniques for rsv diagnosis should be considered. the study recommends that the development of a sentinel approach of representative hospitals should be considered for rsv surveillance. the study recommends that the new networks joining eiss should integrate rsv surveillance alongside influenza. the study suggests that discrepancies in positivity rates for rsv between countries may reflect several factors, including sampling bias and differences in laboratory methods and diagnostic criteria."

pmc1426958,"longer  ≥30 bases  ps-ons are more potent hiv-1 entry and fusion inhibitors than shorter  <30 bases  ps-ons due to their increased hydrophobic character. the interaction of ps-ons with the hydrophobic regions of gp41 is not dependent on their polyanionic nature but rather on their increased hydrophobic character. ps-ons inhibit both hiv-1 attachment and hiv-1-mediated membrane fusion by interacting with multiple target sites along the gp41 amphipathic α-helices, rather than a specific active site that is sensitive to point mutation. the interaction of ps-ons with the α-helices of gp41, the prototypical type i viral fusion protein, has important implications for the potential broad-spectrum antiviral activities of longer ps-ons due to the conservation of these domains in viruses from several different viral families. the mechanism of action described herein shows the potential of α-helix bundle formation as a target for therapeutic activity due to the unaltered activity of longer ps-ons against several t-20-resistant strains and also by the fact that ps-ons have potent in vivo activity against viruses with type i fusion proteins in the families of herpesviridae, orthomyxoviridae, paramyxoviridae, and filoviridae."

pmc3094234,"a randomized controlled trial  rct  is being conducted to investigate the effectiveness of azithromycin in indigenous australian infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis. this study aims to determine whether azithromycin is an effective additional treatment for bronchiolitis in this population, as well as to prevent hospital readmissions from respiratory illnesses within a 6-month period. the study also addresses a large clinical research gap for an important and common cause of hospitalization in indigenous australian children. the study found that indigenous australian infants with bronchiolitis have more severe presentations and higher readmission rates compared to non-indigenous infants. this may be due to an increased likelihood of recurrent infections and virus-bacteria interactions from an early age, as well as heavy bacterial colonization of the nasopharynx. the study found that indigenous australian children and adults have high rates of long-term respiratory dysfunction, which is associated with recurrent hospitalization for acute lower respiratory tract infections  alris  and severity of previous alris. the study found that indigenous australian infants with bronchiolitis often come from remote communities and may have multiple co-morbidities that influence their discharge. therefore, the study used length of stay defined as ""ready for respiratory discharge"" to address this limitation. the study found that the impact of variable presentation, particularly the potential influence of azithromycin's acute immune modulation effect, is a limitation of the study. however, the study's design minimizes the impact of variable presentation by standardizing inclusion criteria, limiting enrollment to within 24 hours of hospitalization, and adopting a strategy  double blind, placebo controlled, allocation concealed methodology  that would theoretically distribute any effect equally between groups. the study also noted that in the event that differences in baseline data between groups are found, statistical methods  multivariate analysis  will be used to adjust as required."

pmc4399404,"high prevalence of streptococcus pyogenes infection in patients with pharyngitis varies widely in the asia-pacific region, ranging from 0 to 28%. this variation is due to differences in patient selection criteria, age, season, and laboratory methods. antibiotic prescribing rates for pharyngitis in the asia-pacific region are highly variable, with overprescribing reported in china, thailand, and korea. antibiotic choices may also be inappropriate in some countries, such as frequent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in japan. patient, healthcare provider, and healthcare system factors contribute to overprescription of antibiotics for respiratory infections. patient factors include excessive patient expectation, lack of knowledge or misconception about antibiotics' effectiveness, and financial incentives. healthcare provider factors include diagnostic uncertainty, fear of complications or medico-legal problems, and lack of communication skills. health system factors include cost constraints, lack of rapid laboratory tests, and patient overload. interventions to reduce antibiotic prescribing for respiratory infections have been done in the asia-pacific region, but narrow scope interventions focusing on key steps of the point-of-care using diagnostic aids and fairly straightforward management strategies have demonstrated effectiveness. multi-faceted interventions combining parent education with clinician behavior change have also decreased antibiotic prescribing rates by between 6 and 21%. health insurance system implementation in low and medium income countries may improve access to medicines, but evidence on its positive impact on appropriate medicine utilization is limited. a multi-prong approach by governments, health training institutions, professional societies, pharmaceutical companies, consumer organizations, and international organizations is needed to promote judicious antibiotic use at the point-of-care through a multi-prong approach targeting patients/consumers, healthcare providers, and healthcare systems."

pmc4455802,"in order to accurately predict the potential for disease spread in livestock, it may not be necessary to collect data on all livestock farms, but only those that contribute most significantly to the livestock trade. this method, called targeted movement sampling, involves recording movements only from the most highly connected farms. it was found to be less effective than using data from all farms, but it may be more practical to implement as it does not require prior knowledge of the relative connectivity of the farms in the network. when within-market transmission occurs, less than 20% of all farms would need to be surveyed in order to accurately predict epidemic sizes for outbreaks seeded in cumbria, devon, and aberdeenshire. the model also gives a very good approximation of the spatial spread of the disease, the size of the epidemic peak, and the epidemic duration. the role played by markets in disease transmission may have a significant effect upon the predictability of the sampling methods. when markets do not contribute to disease transmission, only a very small percentage of nodes would need to be sampled using the targeted network sampling method. however, when markets are explicitly included in the model, assuming that all batches on a market are well mixed, a much larger proportion of the nodes must be sampled. the model presented in this paper uses a weighted static network to simulate the risk of transmission between livestock farms. weighted static networks are regularly used in livestock disease models, but they may potentially underestimate variability when compared with results on dynamic networks. future studies will focus upon constructing a dynamic network and testing network sampling schemes and temporal sampling schemes  whereby sampling is targeted based on time of year  on their ability to predict epidemic behavior. the model framework described here would not be appropriate for a disease of the nature of bovine tuberculosis  btb , where it may be crucial to track movements of individual cattle. this is because animals infected with btb can remain asymptomatic carriers for several months before becoming infectious. the model presented in this paper assumes that infected movements result in all livestock on the destination farm becoming rapidly infected, which is not the case for all livestock diseases. future work will focus upon the development of optimal sampling strategies for slow-spreading diseases such as btb, where it may be crucial to track movements"

pmc6883026,"the current hepatitis a outbreak in korea highlights the need for fundamental changes and advancements in the public health system in the country. this is due to the country's low level of immunity in the adult population, high population density, and increased risks of outbreaks of new types of infectious diseases or healthcare-related infection, resulting from factors such as close contact in schools and workplaces, high healthcare services utilization, cultural habits of eating out with company, and shellfish aquafarming. to prevent hepatitis a outbreaks, three basic policies can be implemented  eliminating infectious agents by identifying and isolating hepatitis a patients who are the source of viral spread, blocking the spread of infection by removing or disinfecting contaminated water, food, and tools used in daily life by susceptible individuals, and increasing immunity among people at risk of infection. natural immunity, acquired through infection at a young age, is currently difficult to acquire in korea due to the country's low incidence of hepatitis a. as a result, large-scale vaccination is a cost-effective measure in countries, such as korea, with a high incidence of hepatitis a, as many people tend to be infected when they are young, and even lower in urban areas. the immunity levels are relatively low among koreans born in the 1970s to 1990s and even lower in urban areas, resulting in a high hepatitis a fatality rate in future outbreaks. therefore, a long-term plan of five years or more is required for organizations such as public health centers to provide adult vaccines at a lower cost than that of private hospitals to provide an alternative for those who are not vaccinated due to cost. the introduction of timely infant vaccination should be considered to improve herd immunity in certain age groups, and a vaccination registration record system may be needed to provide adequate measures for effective control of hepatitis a outbreaks. the establishment and implementation of a long-term plan of five years or more can help overcome hurdles such as securing budgets, vaccine supply, and low vaccination rates."
pmc5372666,"the study found a relationship between coinfection with other viral agents and severity of rsv disease, but this association was not significant. this may be explained, in part, by the older age of the coinfected group. the study confirmed the alternating dominance of rsv-a and rsv-b antigenic groups during winter outbreaks in santiago, chile, in agreement with previous studies. however, no association was found between the rsv antigenic group or genotype and clinical severity. the study found that a delayed viral clearance might be associated with greater airway injury and disease severity. the study suggests that a delayed viral clearance might contribute to greater airway injury and disease severity, as new antiviral drug therapies hold the promise of shortening the clearance of rsv in the respiratory tract and thus might mitigate severity of disease. the study found that higher viral loads were found when sampling occurred earlier during the respiratory illness, but this was only significant for hmpv and not for rsv."

pmc5474348,"in the context of mouse hepatitis virus  mhv -infected mice, regulatory t cells  tregs  play a critical role in suppressing the immune response, which helps to dampen immunopathology. however, their effects on virus clearance are complex, as their presence at early times after infection inhibits virus clearance, which results in more severe demyelination and clinical disease during the chronic phase. in mhv-infected mice, the host immune response is critical for virus clearance, as depletion of tregs or treatment with anti-il-10 antibodies delays virus clearance, resulting in more virus-induced tissue damage. however, treatment with exogenous tregs during the chronic phase reduces inflammation and demyelination, suggesting that use of exogenous tregs in this setting requires careful consideration of the phase of the infection. in the context of tick-borne encephalitis virus  tbev -infected mice, higher numbers of tregs are present in the brains of susceptible mice compared to resistant mice. treg depletion results in increased recruitment of t cells at early times after infection, with no effects on the kinetics of virus clearance or disease outcome. however, treatment with exogenous tregs during the chronic phase reduces inflammation and demyelination, suggesting that use of exogenous tregs in this setting requires careful consideration of the phase of the infection. in tbev-infected mice, treatment with ifn-β or poly i c diminishes demyelination and decreases the number of autoreactive cd4 t cells. concomitant with these changes is an increase in il-10 expression within the cns, consistent with a change from a th1 to th2 response. however, studies of il-10 in the context of tbev are all correlative, and whether il-10 actually has these postulated roles will require additional work. in the context of tbev-infected mice, il-10 produced largely by t cells is elevated in infected mice, and postulated to contribute to delayed virus clearance, much like tregs did, as described above. il-10 expression remains elevated even when treg numbers"

pmc428489,"in the context of estimating spatial spread parameters, a technique using the conservation of conditional pairs is presented. this method is computationally efficient and practical for estimating parameters from a single spatial sample, as collecting spatial data is frequently a time-consuming and difficult process. the estimation technique can work from a single spatial sample, providing accurate estimates from the initial sample without the need for secondary follow-up studies. the method can be used with multiple snapshots by minimizing the deviation ξ across all snapshots. the technique is robust to moderate spatial heterogeneities and multiple seeds before coalescence of invading wave fronts. the estimation technique is applicable to a variety of other uses, from the invasion of unwanted species to understanding the spatial interactions of competing organisms. in the context of estimating parameters for the spread of diseases, the method is shown to be practical for estimating parameters from a single spatial sample. the technique is shown to be robust to moderate spatial heterogeneities and multiple seeds before coalescence of invading wave fronts. the estimation technique can provide accurate estimates from the initial sample without the need for secondary follow-up studies. the method can be used with multiple snapshots by minimizing the deviation ξ across all snapshots. the estimation technique is applicable to a variety of other uses, from the invasion of unwanted species to understanding the spatial interactions of competing organisms. in the context of estimating spatial spread parameters, the technique is shown to be computationally efficient and practical for estimating parameters from a single spatial sample. this method is shown to be robust to moderate spatial heterogeneities and multiple seeds before coalescence of invading wave fronts. the estimation technique is shown to be applicable to a variety of other uses, from the invasion of unwanted species to understanding the spatial interactions of competing organisms. the estimation technique is computationally efficient, providing accurate estimates from the initial sample without the need for secondary follow-up studies. in the context of estimating parameters for the spread of diseases, the method is shown to be practical for estimating parameters from a single spatial sample. the technique is shown to be robust to moderate spatial heterogeneities and multiple seeds before coalescence of invading wave fronts. the estimation technique is shown to be computationally efficient, providing accurate estimates from the initial sample without the need for secondary follow-up studies. the method can be"
pmc3835772,"the study utilized a computer program to detect potential pseudoknots in the full-length genomic mrnas of various viruses, and found that over 90% of detected pseudoknots conform to the cpk-1 family, a common structural motif for maintaining a stable and compact pseudoknotted scaffold. the lengths and compositions of stem 1 and loop 2 of these pseudoknots showed variations, especially when viruses from different evolutionary groups were compared, suggesting the need for fine-tuning of frameshifting efficiency in different viruses. the study also found that the frameshift or readthrough stimulating pseudoknots, especially those in the cpk-1 family, are among the most stable pseudoknots within the viral genomic mrnas, and their stabilities have been fine-tuned during evolution to be optimal for decoding events. the study found that some hiv-1 viruses may utilize a novel mechanism that involves three pseudoknots to regulate frameshift efficiency at the gag-pol junction. the study proved the usefulness of its pseudoknot-detecting program, as over 70% of the detected pseudoknots ranked among the most stable pseudoknots within the viral genomic mrnas. the study showed that viral genomic mrnas do not contain strong roadblocking pseudoknots that would significantly stall ribosomes and induce no-go decay, as equilibrium-based mechanisms for the regulation of read-through efficiency were shown to play a functional role in translational recoding in murine leukaemia virus."
pmc3514223,"a study conducted in a large cohort of children with severe childhood malaria revealed that there are distinguishable changes in the plasma proteome profile associated with different malaria syndromes. this study showed that there are significant differences in the plasma proteome profiles between children with severe malarial anemia or cerebral malaria and those with uncomplicated malaria. the study also found that the degree of overlap between the plasma proteome profiles of children with cerebral malaria and those with severe malarial anemia is lower than that observed between the severe groups. these findings suggest that beyond the common underlying mechanisms, such as acute inflammation, there are significant differences in the pathogenesis of the severe malaria syndromes studied. the study further highlighted the need for more specific protein markers to further deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of severe malaria syndromes."

pmc5128919,"the study identified two non-structural proteins  nsp2 and nsp3  in the chikungunya virus that exhibit rna interference  rnai  suppressor activity. the findings suggest that nsp2 and nsp3 have rnai suppressor activity by binding to small rna molecules and suppressing rnai-mediated gene silencing. the study revealed that the rnai suppressor activity of nsp2 and nsp3 is conserved among alphaviruses, including chikungunya virus. electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to evaluate the binding of small rna molecules to the chikungunya virus nsp2 and nsp3 proteins. the study showed that the rnai suppressor activity of nsp2 and nsp3 is also conserved among small rna molecules in other alphaviruses, as predicted using bindn software."
pmc2719066,"the study found that the hpre and wpre elements, which promote the nuclear export of intronless transcripts, can enhance expression of heterologous genes in vitro, particularly when combined with appropriate promoter/enhancer elements at the transcription level. the study demonstrated that hpre or wpre has a greater effect on gag gene expression in vitro than cmv introna, and pinhgag carrying both elements induced the best immune responses among all groups. the study showed that dna vaccine carrying an hiv gene with native codon usage could achieve impressive in vitro expression and in vivo immunogenicity in a rev-independent manner if the elements were appropriately optimized at the posttranscriptional level. the study highlighted the application of this alternative gene optimization strategy in high-throughput screening experiments involving native or hiv genes or the production of lentiviral vectors where the codon-optimized gene is not available. the study observed that pinhgag plasmid in general showed the strongest immunogenicity among all constructs, and immune responses induced by 10 μg of pinhgag were comparable to those induced by the same amount of codon-optimized gag dna vaccine."
pmc5197931,"a study on adult respiratory viral infections found that the rate of fever in laboratory-confirmed cases was lower compared to children, with only 23.1% of influenza cases and 40.5% of other respiratory viral infections presenting with fever. this suggests that for rapid treatment and reducing the risk of transmission of infection, clinicians should be aware that a diagnosis of viral respiratory infection, even influenza, is possible in the absence of fever. the study also found that smoking was a significant predictor of fever, with smokers around five times more likely to have fever compared to non-smokers. this highlights the need for further epidemiological and clinical studies to explore the possible mechanisms behind this finding. the study found that co-infection with more than one virus was the strongest predictor of fever for adults with confirmed viral respiratory infections. this highlights the need for clinicians to consider the possibility of co-infection if a patient presents with fever, as co-infection cases are associated with higher rates of hospitalization and icu admission. the study found that rates of fever in co-infection cases were higher compared to single viral infection. this highlights the possible increased severity of symptoms in co-infection cases, which could be due to an altered immune response associated with co-infection. the study found that the rate of fever in chinese hcws was lower compared to vietnamese hcws. this highlights the need for further epidemiological studies to explore the possible reasons behind this finding, as it could be due to differences in circulating viruses  and their pyrogenicity  between the two countries when the studies were conducted."
pmc371061,"in response to neurotropic viral infections, brain immune cells, such as astrocytes and microglia, produce a more elaborate proinflammatory immune response, including up-regulation of a set of five proinflammatory cytokines, than in response to nonneurotropic viral infections. this differential immune response is parallel to the th1 proinflammatory response of t-helper lymphocytes and is crucial for the development of inflammatory demyelinating diseases. the proinflammatory cytokine response to neurotropic viral infections consists of cytokines, such as il-12, tnf-α, il-15, il-6, and il-1β, that would normally be associated with the recruitment of inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and macrophages, to the site of infection. these cytokines contribute to the characteristic manifestations of encephalitis and the disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which facilitates additional dissemination of the virus within the cns. the differential immune response to neurotropic and nonneurotropic viral infections is consistent with the idea that cytokine induction is a pivotal factor in the development of an inflammatory cns disease. this differential response is important because it has many similarities with the human demyelinating disease ms and has been reported in ms and other animal models of ms. il-12 induction involves innate immune responses in viral and autoimmune conditions, such as theiler's virus encephalomyelitis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  eae , and experimental colitis. il-15 mediates t-cell responses and innate activity and is also known as an inducer of additional tnf-α. il-6 is a cytokine frequently induced by tnf-α and other proinflammatory regulatory molecules and has been associated with neurotropic viral infections, eae, and other autoimmune conditions of the cns. the relevance of the proinflammatory cytokine response to mhv-a59-induced"

pmc552329,"the study provides evidence for homologous recombination  hr  in negative-sense rna viruses, specifically in hantaviruses, through the generation and spread of advantageous genetic combinations and the purging function attributed to hr, i.e. recombination between homologous parental molecules through crossover at homologous sites. the study reports the first evidence for hr in negative-sense rna viruses, specifically in hantaviruses, through the identification of a mosaic-like structure of the s rna segment and the n protein of tula hantavirus  tulv , which is formed by a relatively long hairpin-like structure within the ""hot-spot"" between nt 332 and nt 368 in the s rna segment. the study shows that hr occurs in hantavirus, which is maintained in nature in persistent infection in natural host species, resulting in the formation of a recombinant virus, which presents no real match to the original cell adapted variant and has a stable genotype, as observed in the case of rectulv, which forms foci similar in size to those of the original variant, tulv02, and grows to similar titers. the study reveals that the survival time of the recombinant virus, in this case rectulv, in the presence of the parental virus, tulv02, is sufficient for transmission of a recombinant virus, in a hypothetical in vivo situation, from one rodent to another, as observed in the case of hantavirus. the study suggests that the hairpin-like structure formed by a highly conserved inverted repeat in the 3'-noncoding region of the s rna segment of tulv, which presents obstacles for sliding of the viral rna polymerase along the template, might be involved in hr events, as observed in the case of puumala hantavirus."
pmc6305816,"the study aimed to construct a positive control based on ar rna technology using hiv-1 rna as a model. the researchers cloned the hiv-1 subtype crf-ad35 sequence into the ms2 genome in the pet32a expression vector in e. coli de3  bl21  strain. the resulting ar rna was stable after treatment with dnase i and rnase a, similar to previous studies. the ar rna was assembled in ms2 phage capsid using peg 6000 and further purified with sephacryl s-200. the researchers used the taqman method for real-time rt-pcr, which is more specific than dsdna-binding dye. the study also indicated that the stability of ar rna in the presence of rnase and durability of ar rna and naked rna were similar to previous studies. the researchers prepared a duplicate of the real-time rt-pcr assay, which had a high sensitivity, and the lod of the channel  fam  was 101 copies/µl of ar rna, indicating a constantly high amplification efficiency  >99% . the study suggested that the stability of ar rna in the presence of rnase and durability of ar rna and naked rna were similar to previous studies. the researchers also compared the stability of ar rna and naked rna. the study could serve as a basis for stabilizing other infectious agents due to the high cost of commercial rna controls based on ar technology, limiting their usage in developed countries. the researchers also developed a virus-based control that requires an accurate analysis and evaluation with a panel of other infectious agents, as well as hiv-1-positive samples. this positive control could be used as a basis for launching an in-house hiv-1 virus assay and could be made readily available to laboratories and hiv research centers."

pmc2824282,"in a study on the spread of foot-and-mouth disease  fmd  in the united states, the authors found that using random spatial locations to predict optimal control strategies, such as ring culling, still leads to a substantial improvement in epidemic impact, as long as the models are reparameterized to match the epidemic data. however, the optimal ring size predicted from random spatial locations is typically an overestimate of the true optimal radius, and using this overestimate still leads to a significant improvement in epidemic impact and is only slightly worse than using the true value optimized to account for spatial structure in the distribution of farms. the authors also found that when precise demographic data are unavailable, alternate methods need to be adopted for mathematical modelers to predict control of epidemics with spatially localized transmission. in the united states, where precise knowledge of farm location is unknown but aggregate farm statistics are available, this work provides an insight into the role that mathematical modeling can still play in informing disease control policy. the authors noted that when case report data are available in real time and parameterization is performed using state-of-the-art methodology, this work can provide rapid policy advice that could minimize potential losses, as it is likely that the approach can be used robustly in many situations, providing timely policy advice that could minimize potential losses, given the simplicity and parsimony of the approach. the authors also found that the effect of ring culling at the optimal radius rrr, based on a random-location model, is still a significant improvement in epidemic impact, even when the models using random spatial locations are reparameterized to match epidemics from real or surrogate sources. however, the optimal ring size predicted from random spatial locations is, in general, a slight overestimate of the true optimal radius, and using this overestimate still leads to a substantial improvement in epidemic impact and is only slightly worse than using the true value optimized to account for spatial structure in the distribution of farms. the authors concluded that recognizing that epidemics take place in a spatial landscape is vital, but once a model has been parameterized to match the epidemic data, much of the spatial structure is subsumed into the reparameterization. as such, aggregate data and aggregate case reports can be used to derive predictions for control of epidemics with spatially local"
pmc5029822,"the study found that mice housed in intracage ventilation  icv  systems had significantly higher rates of water consumption, urine osmolality, and insensible water loss through the skin  tewl  compared to mice housed in static  closed-top  cages. this difference was seen in all strains of mice studied, including scid, skh, fvb, and c57 mice. the study also found that hairless c57 mice housed in icv systems had significantly higher rates of insensible water loss through the skin compared to mice housed in static cages. this finding suggests that the epidermis of these mice may not be able to compensate for depilation, increasing the risk for dehydration in mice already compromised due to experimental manipulation. the study found that c57 mice, which is a primary mouse strain used in biomedical research, had significantly higher rates of insensible water loss through the skin compared to mice housed in static cages. this finding is important, as it indicates that the increased insensible water loss in c57 mice housed in icv systems is a strain-specific difference that should be considered in studies involving renal function or water restriction. the study found that mice housed in icv systems had significantly higher rates of water consumption and urine osmolality compared to mice housed in static cages, regardless of mouse sex or strain. the study found that mice housed in icv systems had significantly higher rates of insensible water loss through the skin compared to mice housed in static cages, regardless of mouse sex or strain. however, further investigation is needed to determine whether the increased insensible water loss in c57 mice housed in icv systems is a result of altered vitamin a metabolism, excessive grooming, or the robust t-helper immune response of this strain, as these factors have been associated with subacute changes in the dermis of these mice."
pmc5148018,"the longitudinal profiles of igg and igm antibodies against mers-cov in sera from a mers patient showed that seroconversion of antibodies against s, s1, and rbd occurred earlier than seroconversion of antibodies against the whole mers-cov virus particle. the s, s1, and rbd elisas were more sensitive than other elisa formats, especially the s1 and rbd elisas, as they are smaller than the full-length s and easier to express and purify. the ppnt assay, which does not require biosafety level 3 facilities, showed an excellent correlation with the s elisa, although the latter is a binding assay while the former is a functional neutralizing assay. the np-based elisa, which is an immunodominant antigen used to detect sars-cov infection, showed later seroconversion of np-specific antibodies compared to seroconversion of antibodies against several s proteins and inactivated mers-cov. the s, s1, ntd, and rbd elisas, as well as the ppnt assay, can be used for mers-cov diagnosis and seroepidemiology, with the s, s1, and rbd elisas being more sensitive than other elisa formats."
pmc4534810,"as of march 2015, there have been 1102 laboratory-confirmed cases of mers-cov, with a case fatality rate of 37.7%. most cases  973  have been reported in saudi arabia and other countries in the arabian peninsula, with cases reported outside the region linked to travel to or from the area. mers-cov belongs to the c lineage of the genus betacoronavirus, with the taphozous perforatus as a probable natural reservoir. bat guano, saliva, and/or urine contaminate food and water resources in areas with palm orchards, potentially serving as an indirect source of transmission to camels, people, and other animals. dipeptidyl peptidase 4  dpp4 , also known as cd26, is the functional receptor for mers-cov. the virus can cause severe respiratory illness, particularly in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, although asymptomatic and mild cases have also been reported. co-infection with other pathogens, including influenza a, parainfluenza, herpes simplex, and pneumococcus, has been reported in mers-cov cases. the annual mortality associated with mers-cov is lower than that of many other viruses that induce acute viral infections, such as seasonal flu, rotavirus, measles, rabies, yellow fever virus, dengue fever virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and lassa fever virus. the virus is prone to replicate efficiently in primate, pig, and goat cell cultures, but people in direct contact with camels are at the most risk of contracting mers-cov infection, with other possible indirect contact including the consumption of unpasteurized camel milk. mers-cov positive sera has been found in samples from as early as 1983 in somalia and sudan, indicating that the virus has been circulating for at least 31 years in the horn of africa countries without causing large-scale fatalities in humans."

pmc3544629,"the study identified pediatric lower respiratory tract infections  lrtis  and respiratory syncytial virus  rsv -associated lrtis as a significant burden on the acute care setting in british columbia, with a pronounced seasonal variability. the study found that infants less than 1 year of age and high-risk infants had a higher incidence of lrtis and longer hospital stays compared to other pediatric patients. the study estimated an increase in the pediatric population of approximately 17% by 2030, which may be a conservative estimate compared to other published reports, and may significantly impact the demand for lrtis on pediatric inpatient settings. the study suggests that non-pharmacological intervention strategies, such as frequent hand washing and separating infected people from non-infected people, can significantly contribute to reducing the demand of lrtis on pediatric inpatient settings, particularly during seasonal lrti and rsv outbreaks. the study highlights the significance of developing targeted prevention strategies, as improved surveillance on the cause of pediatric lrtis may provide valuable insight for assessing current and future demand, as well as for developing prevention strategies to be implemented at specific times of the year."
pmc5871024,"a study in a low-felv prevalence region in the uk found that while 27% of clinically healthy cats were positive for feline leukemia virus  felv  antigenemia, only 4% tested positive for felv provirus dna. this suggests that a portion of felv-exposed cats, previously believed to be progressively infected, may actually be regressively infected, with the potential for future viral reactivation. the study also found that while rapid felv antigen immunoassays can serve as an initial screening test, they cannot identify cats with regressive infection, and a portion of felv-antigen positive cats are actually regressively infected. therefore, screening with a rapid felv antigen immunoassay alone carries the risk of false-positive results, and any positive antigen results from stand-alone rapid felv antigen immunoassays could be followed up with a rapid felv antigen immunoassay and a felv proviral dna test, as suggested above. the study demonstrated that both felv proviral dna and antigen tests can be carried out simultaneously using a single reagent set, the felv reverse transcription-insulated isothermal pcr  rt-iipcr  reagent set, which allows for the detection of both viral rna and proviral dna template. this reagent set can potentially work with a rapid felv antigen immunoassay as a suitable patient-side tool to aid felv infection confirmation and diagnosis. the study found that while rapid felv antigen immunoassays can serve as an initial screening test, they cannot identify cats with regressively infection, and a portion of felv-antigen positive cats are actually regressively infected. therefore, screening with a rapid felv antigen immunoassay alone carries the risk of false-positive results, and any positive antigen results from stand-alone rapid felv antigen immunoassays could be followed up with a rapid felv antigen immunoassay and a felv proviral dna test, as suggested above. the study found that while rapid felv antigen immunoassays can serve as an initial screening test, they cannot identify cats with regress"

pmc3297554,"the pilot study in kilifi, tanzania, identified a viral etiology in 76% of hospitalized children with pneumonia, with rsv as the predominant virus. in this study, the etiology of pneumonia remained unknown in a quarter of hospitalized children, despite fairly comprehensive testing. the collection of induced sputum specimens was accepted by parents, well tolerated, feasible for use in a rural developing world setting, and provided useful diagnostic information. the study found that the collection of is specimens was accepted by parents, well tolerated, feasible for use in a rural developing world setting, and provided etiological information. the study found that lung aspirates and postmortem studies were not performed in their pilot, but these procedures are critical to a better understanding of pneumonia etiology and fatal pneumonia in children, and they will be incorporated in selected sites in the perch study."
pmc4281269,"in the context of the brome mosaic virus  bmv  replication cycle, a previously validated mathematical model was applied to investigate interactions between the virus and host factors in synthetic yeast. the model was developed to describe an experiment performed in synthetic yeast that contained plasmids for rna3 and protein 1a, whose expression is controlled separately by the concentration of galactose and copper, respectively. the results suggest that experimental input manipulation can produce non-equilibrium system dynamics, leading to a greater information content in collected data. optimizing only the experimental input resulted in acceptably narrow confidence intervals for m, the parameter for the interaction between rna3 and protein 1a, as well as extremely narrow confidence intervals for all other parameters regardless of the choice of optimal design criteria. in the context of the development of a new class of materials, the authors found that the structure of the ω-limit set affects the convergence of the iterative algorithm  equations  4 ,  5   used to investigate the system dynamics. this algorithm can be applied in other genetic network systems that approach a periodic equilibrium to test whether the structure of the ω-limit set affects algorithm convergence. in the context of the development of a new class of materials, the authors discovered that the addition of a new component to the system resulted in a decrease in the number of degrees of freedom required to achieve a certain level of complexity in the system behavior. this finding suggests that the design of complex materials with a reduced number of degrees of freedom could lead to a more efficient and controlled manufacturing process. in the context of the investigation of a new class of materials, the authors found that the system's response to external stimuli could be controlled by modifying the interaction strength between the components. this finding suggests that the design of complex materials with controllable response to external stimuli could lead to a more versatile and functional class of materials. in the context of the investigation of a new class of materials, the authors found that the addition of a new component to the system resulted in a change in the system's symmetry. this finding suggests that the design of complex materials with controlled symmetry could lead to a more tailored and optimized performance in specific applications."
pmc3020023,"the study identified a type ii transmembrane serine protease, tmprss2, as a critical factor in enhancing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  sars-cov  entry into human cells. tmprss2 is a member of the hepsin/tmprss subfamily and is known to cleave other viral and cellular proteins. tmprss2 cleaves the sars-cov spike  s  glycoprotein, a process that is required for efficient viral entry into cells. tmprss2-mediated activation of s is achieved by at least two divergent proteases, as the study found that s is shed by both tmprss2 and tace, an unrelated protease known to cleave sars-cov s. ace2, the sars-cov receptor, is cleaved by tmprss2, which is consistent with the finding that tmprss2 and ace2 colocalize in cells. the study also found that tmprss2 degraded ace2, making it challenging to microscopically identify cells in which both of these proteins were present. however, when rare ace2+ tmprss2+ cells were found, clear colocalizations were immediately evident. the study found that tmprss2 does not influence sars-cov-mediated entry into adjacent ace2+ cells, despite the fact that wild-type tmprss2, but not the inactive zymogen, coprecipitated ace2. the study also found that tmprss2 did not digest ace2 when the two membrane proteins were expressed in adjacent cells. therefore, the study suggests that the cells most susceptible to sars-cov infection are those in which ace2 and tmprss2 are simultaneously present and that tmprss2-mediated activation of s occurs in cis, rather than in trans. the study also found that the sars-cov spike is activated by tmprss2 during or after exocytic transport in cells, analogous to influenza virus ha0 activation and numerous furin-cleaved viral glycoproteins. the study suggests that tmprss2 provides a certain ""immediacy"" of s activation that can"
pmc343853,"during the peak of the first phase of the sars outbreak in toronto, 64.7% of hospital staff reported concerns about their own health, and 62.7% reported concerns about their family's health. nurses were the occupation with the highest proportion of staff who reported concerns  76.3% . of the hospital staff who completed the ghq-12, 29.0%  148/510  scored above the threshold of 3, indicating probable emotional distress. the proportion of nurses who scored above the threshold was 45.1%  37/82 . the most bothersome precautionary measure was wearing a mask, with physical discomfort being the most commonly cited difficulty. three-quarters  75.0%  of the respondents reported that the control measures were sufficient to prevent contracting sars. logistic regression analysis identified 4 factors associated with increased levels of concern about personal or family health  perception of a greater risk of death from sars, living with children, personal or family lifestyle affected by sars, and being treated differently by people because of working in a hospital. logistic regression analysis also identified 4 factors associated with the presence of emotional distress  being a nurse, part-time employment status, lifestyle affected by sars, and ability to do one's job affected by the precautionary measures. positive aspects of the sars outbreak were also reported, including increased awareness of disease control, learning experiences, and a greater sense of togetherness and cooperation among hospital staff. part-time staff were more likely than full-time staff to experience emotional distress, which may be attributed to part-time staff's receiving less current information, having a reduced sense of involvement in the hospital's response to the sars situation, and having a weaker social support network within their work environment. the study has several potential limitations, including a low response rate, as well as limitations related to the use of the ghq-12 and the fact that the response rate for the ghq-12 was limited to a subsample of staff."
pmc3407897,"the effects of lectins on hpv-2 infection were studied. three lectins, con a, lca, and pna, were used to analyze the inhibition of virus entry, rna synthesis, and protein synthesis. the lectins, which do not bind to the sugar moieties of hpv-2, were found to partially inhibit virus rna synthesis and largely inhibited protein syntheses. the lectins non-specifically prevented the entry of hpv-2 into cells by binding to the cell surface lectin receptors. the study showed that the lectins had a partial inhibitory effect on hpv-2 rna synthesis and largely inhibited protein syntheses. the results suggest that the prevention of hpv-2 adsorption to the cells may be due to the non-specific hindrance caused by the lectins binding to the cell surface sugar moieties."
pmc3146865,"the effectiveness of weekend-extension strategies in controlling and preventing influenza epidemics depends on the length and pattern of extensions, as well as the compliance level of businesses. the three-day extension strategy is the most effective to confine the spatial spread of seasonal flu, as it greatly reduces the travel between homes and workplaces and allows people to move freely to anywhere they want during the extended weekend. longer and less frequent interruptions on influenza transmission would be more effective in disease control than shorter and more frequent interruptions, as the transmission of influenza would be doubly effective if infectious individuals constantly meet with susceptible individuals at both homes and workplaces. the weekend-extension strategy could be a feasible measure for countries with limited health resources, as it does not require stockpiles of vaccines and antiviral drugs for fighting emerging infectious diseases that are poorly understood and unprepared for, such as new strains of influenza, sars, and ebola. the shares of infections at neighbor households and service places are greatly enlarged by the three discontinuous extension strategies, as the possible routes for transmission are quickly exhausted at homes, and epidemics cannot further develop until individuals go back to work."
pmc3834272,"the study demonstrates that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system  raas  plays a role in the pathogenesis of bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and fibrosis through the regulation of mononuclear phagocyte phenotype switching. spironolactone, a clinically approved drug that targets the raas, attenuates bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and fibrosis by inhibiting the expansion of circulating inflammatory ly6chi monocytes and reducing the alternative activation of mononuclear phagocytes in the alveolar compartment. the study highlights mineralocorticoid receptor  mr  as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit ly6chi monocyte-mediated inflammatory response in acute lung injury and fibrosis. the study suggests that spironolactone-induced amelioration of lung injury is multifactorial, as it affects not only mononuclear phagocytes but also neutrophils and macrophages lacking mr, which exhibit alternative activation  m2 polarization . the study highlights the limitations of the current understanding of the effects of spironolactone on bleomycin-induced lung injury, including the need for monocyte-targeted approaches, the complexity of the algorithms used to identify macrophages, and the need for in vitro studies to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying suppressed ly6chi monocytosis by mr antagonism."
pmc1488829,"the study found that a combination of fluticasone and salmeterol  fps  was more effective than either drug alone in reducing asthma exacerbations caused by respiratory syncytial virus  rsv  infection in ovalbumin  ova -sensitized mice. this synergistic effect was observed in terms of reducing airway hyperreactivity  ahr , lung inflammation, and rsv titers in the lungs. the study showed that fps treatment resulted in a significant decrease in rsv-induced inflammation and rsv titers compared to mice receiving the drugs individually. this suggests that the use of combination therapy can be effective in reducing virally-induced asthma exacerbations using already available therapies. the study found that fps treatment reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the lungs of mice infected with rsv, indicating that the combination treatment can exert additional antiviral effects. the study demonstrated that fps treatment decreased the expression of the inflammatory marker icam-1 in the lungs of mice infected with rsv, suggesting that the combination treatment can further reduce lung inflammation. the study showed that fps treatment resulted in an increase in interleukin-4  il-4  production in the lungs of mice infected with rsv, which is a characteristic feature of the th2-type response observed in human infants suffering from acute rsv bronchiolitis. this suggests that the combination treatment can exert additional antiviral effects and may be effective in managing rsv-induced asthma exacerbations."
pmc3514351,"the study found that the virulence of the chinese highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  prrsv  strain rjxwn06 is significantly different from that of the prototype strain vr-2332. this was demonstrated through the analysis of gene expression profiles in tracheobronchial lymph nodes of pigs infected with either strain at a snapshot of 13 days post-infection. the study identified a significant number of differentially expressed genes between the two strains, which were mapped to genetic networks available in the ingenuity database. these networks were ranked based on the number of significantly expressed genes they contained and also listed diseases that were most significant. the study found that the expression of genes involved in the regulation of the immune system was significantly downregulated in pigs infected with the highly pathogenic strain rjxwn06, while the expression of genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell death was significantly upregulated. the study also found that the highly pathogenic strain rjxwn06 caused more severe lesions in the lungs of infected pigs than the prototype strain vr-2332. the study utilized a computational pipeline comprised of gsnap for alignment and genome construction, and cufflinks to determine if differential expression and changes in transcript abundance were statistically significant. the pipeline also involved the use of cuffmerge to create a single transcript dataset from multiple reconstructions, and gene annotation using a mysql database matching to the ensembl sscrofa9.56 reference genome currently supported by the integrative genomics viewer  broad institute ."
pmc4957429,"the study aimed to develop a statistical model to quantify the risk of mers importation at the country level using openly accessible data, including airline transportation networks. the model assumed that the hazard of mers importation followed an inverse function of the effective distance, calculated from airline transportation data. the model showed high predictive performance, with an area under the curve of 0.943 and 100% sensitivity. the study identified 30 countries at highest risk of mers importation, with 17 of those countries already reporting at least one importation. the model's predictive performance was not significantly improved by including country-specific religion, suggesting that the effective distance metric is a powerful predictor of mers importation risk."
pmc4987038,"open science practices, including open access, open data, and open notebook science, have become widespread in the health sciences landscape, facilitating accelerated advances in public health. major research sponsors, such as the national institutes of health and the bill & melinda gates foundation, have implemented policies encouraging or requiring data sharing. during the ebola and zika epidemics, researchers rapidly shared data in public repositories, allowing for collaborative analysis and discovery. challenges to data sharing include lack of established standards for data users to credit providers, doubts about the value of sharing data for career advancement, and inadequate technology, standards, or human capacity in lower-resource settings. initiatives to facilitate discovery of datasets, provide measures of academic contribution, establish common platforms for sharing and integrating research data, and improve data-sharing capacity in resource-limited areas are critical to improving preparedness and response to future epidemics."
pmc4445510,"in this study, 3 proteins  alpha-1-acid glycoprotein  agp , apolipoprotein-a1  apo-a1 , and apolipoprotein-a1 precursor  pre apo-a1   were identified as potential biomarkers for feline pancreatic disease using proteomic analysis of plasma protein profiles. higher agp concentrations tended to be found in cats with pancreatic disease, although there was considerable overlap among cats with pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma, and healthy controls. apolipoprotein-a1  apo-a1  appeared lower in cats with pancreatic disease, although this difference was not statistically significant due to the low sample size. pre apolipoprotein-a1  pre apo-a1  appeared higher in cats with pancreatic disease, and the mean pre apo-a1 spot volume was significantly higher in cats with pancreatic carcinoma than in healthy controls. the study suggests possible alteration of lipid metabolism associated with feline pancreatic disease in relation to shifts in apo-a1 and pre apo-a1."
pmc5023329,"the study found that vaccine-derived newcastle disease virus  ndv  is widely circulating in wild bird populations worldwide, with at least 17 species from 10 different orders identified as shedders. the study also revealed that four different types of vaccine-derived ndv have been identified in at least 17 wild bird species from 10 different orders, with lasota- and b1-like viruses being shed more frequently than the rest. the study highlighted that the order columbiformes, comprising primarily rock pigeons, had a high incidence of shedding vaccine-derived ndv, and this may be associated with the higher vulnerability to disease of juveniles due to their increased movement requirements for foraging, in concert with naïve immune systems. the study also suggested that the order anseriformes, which has a high rate of detection of vaccine-derived ndv from wild birds representing declining species or species at imminent risk of decline, may reflect a higher degree of contact between wild birds and domestic members of this order as a result of the larger populations of ducks and geese used as poultry in asia. the study also noted that species reported to shed vaccine-derived ndv are listed by the international union for conservation of nature as taxa of conservation concern, and some of the vaccine-derived viruses were obtained from wild birds representing declining species or species at imminent risk of decline, but the ecological implications of this finding are currently unknown."
pmc2238845,"the discovery of acquired immune deficiency syndrome  aids  has led to renewed appreciation of the consequences of emerging infectious diseases. biomarkers, molecules that can be sensitively measured in the human body, are by definition potentially diagnostic and are increasingly important in both therapeutic and diagnostic processes. vast resources have been devoted to identifying and developing biomarkers, but the rate of development of novel biomarkers has been falling, suggesting that a resource that leverages existing data is overdue. the infectious disease biomarker database  idb  catalogs putative and validated biomarkers, relates them to research tools for sequence and structural analyses of the data, and provides resources for sequence and structure analysis. idb currently includes information on 611 biomarkers from 66 infectious diseases and 70 pathogens, and its goal is to collect a complete dataset of validated or potential biomarkers used in the detection of infectious diseases and to generate a knowledgebase that would be a valuable tool for users interested in the discovery of infectious disease biomarkers."

pmc6604270,"the study found that a mixture of 5 compounds called vb, as well as a mixture of 3 compounds called pm, both containing polyhexamethylene biguanidine, showed broad-ranging antimicrobial and antiviral effects against various pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, as well as against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  mrsa  and human immunodeficiency virus  hiv . the study demonstrated the stability of the elements contained in vb and pm compounds over an approximately 3-month period, indicating their stability in physical properties. the study found that the use of vb or pm compounds in moist hand towels resulted in significant reductions in adhesive bacterial counts compared to the use of a commercially available moist hand towel supplemented with ethanol. the study also suggested that adding vb to moist hand towels enabled them to serve as effective hygienic tools in ordinary daily life. the study noted that the use of hypochlorous acid in combination with vb or pm compounds at optimum concentrations provided persistence to the individual effects of hypochlorous acid."
pmc5411280,"the dna vaccine encoding the mers-cov s1 protein induced potent humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, including high levels of neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific cytokine production. the dna vaccine accelerated virus clearance in ad5-hdpp4-transduced mice infected with the mers-cov emc strain, indicating that the neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov s1 protein were protective. the dna vaccine induced antigen-specific immune responses in mice, including antibody generation, neutralizing antibodies generation, and cytokine secretion, following three immunizations without adjuvant. the dna vaccine did not induce adverse effects in vaccinated animals, suggesting its safety and potential use in non-human primates and camels for gene-based vaccine development. the dna vaccine using the s1 protein of mers-cov as an antigen was effective in eliciting antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, supporting its use as an effective target for gene-based vaccine development against different mers-cov strains."
pmc3323182,"during the sars outbreak in california from march to july 2003, 73 out of 165 patients had a pathogen identified using polymerase chain reaction  pcr , culture, and serologic tests. rt-pcr was the most sensitive diagnostic method, identifying a likely causal agent in 41% of patients with suspect sars cases and 32% of patients with probable sars cases. serologic testing identified a likely etiologic agent in specimens from an additional 6 patients who met the sars criteria, including 3 with suspect sars cases and 3 with probable sars cases. hmpv, whose role in sars-cov infection remains undefined, was detected by pcr in four patients with suspect sars cases and two patients with probable sars cases. determining a commonly recognized cause for an influenza-like illness allowed cases to be removed from the suspect or probable sars categories, alleviating the required epidemiologic investigation, hospitalization or isolation, strict infection control precautions, and additional specimen collection and contact tracing."

pmc3160845,"symptom profile distributions for influenza and non-influenza cases were proposed to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the distribution of symptom profiles for influenza and non-influenza cases using data from a survey. these symptom profile distributions were examined through simulations in section s3. the proposed method assumes that while the overall distribution for symptomatic non-influenza cases may not change significantly during different time periods, the distribution of symptom profiles for influenza cases may change due to an influenza outbreak with ""atypical"" symptoms, and this group is correlated with a weaker presentation of symptoms during different time periods. therefore, a large non-influenza outbreak with ""atypical"" symptoms may still be robust due to a relatively small sample size in section s2. the accuracy of the estimation of the distribution of symptom profiles for influenza and non-influenza cases using data from a survey is sensitive to the ability to accurately estimate the distribution of symptom profiles for non-influenza cases due to the fact that there are many more symptomatic non-influenza cases compared to the number of symptomatic influenza cases in a survey, and a misattribution of a certain percentage of non-influenza cases to influenza is magnified relative to the flu data due to the high flu circulation during different time periods. the proposed method assumes that since the distribution of symptom profiles for influenza cases may be different from the overall distribution for symptomatic non-influenza cases during different time periods, a larger non-influenza outbreak with ""atypical"" symptoms may still be robust due to a relatively small sample size in section s2. the proposed method suggests including this agent into the list of infections whose incidence is estimated through the deconvolution process in section s3, where a large non-influenza outbreak with ""atypical"" symptoms is added as an unobserved component. alternatively, one may stick with flu and symptomatic non-influenza cases as the two infectious profiles and use the excess fever approach  symptom profile given by equation  2b   in section s2. the latter may still be robust due to a relatively small sample size in section s2, where no statistically significant difference could be detected for the small sample of cases"
pmc6062100,"the study found that the accumulation of flaviviral satellite rna  sfrna  in jev-infected cells does not require viral rna replication, as demonstrated by the accumulation of sfrna in cells electroporated with nonreplicating rna constructs. the study identified a putative promoter element, the slii structure, as essential for sfrna accumulation, as deletion mutants made on the slii structure abolished all sfrna formation but did not give rise to smaller sfrna species. the study found that the initiation site of jev sfrna is located at a 3'-cyclization-like motif, complementary to the 5' cyclization sequences, and may be involved in genome cyclization during antigenome synthesis. the study found that the jev sfrna is likely synthesized by transcription initially and then could be further trimmed by exoribonuclease xrn1 and/or other unidentified enzymes. the study found that the slii structure is responsible for sfrna synthesis, and the accumulation of smaller jev rna species did not occur upon deletion of the cyc-like motif in vivo."

pmc5113152,"long single-stranded rna  ssrna  molecules exhibit coarse-grained structure characterized by their molecular length  molecular length distribution, mld  and degree of branching  radii of gyration, rg  in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on the mld alone. however, there are notable discrepancies between predicted and measured sizes, particularly for long rnas, which can be remedied by estimating mld from structure-probing data or selecting structures with mlds compatible with experimentally determined hydrodynamic radii. hydrodynamic size reduction is observed in the presence of multivalent ions, indicating the importance of repulsive electrostatic interactions and formation of tertiary contacts stabilized by multivalent cations, not accounted for in the theoretical approach used here. the observed differences in compactness and extendedness of rna molecules may reflect various biological functions they perform. for example, viruses with segmented rna genomes may preferentially utilize extended, less branched rna conformations for their segment precursors to minimize the formation of nonspecific intersegment rna-rna contacts, while enabling formation of specific interactions facilitated by viral rna chaperones. the effects of di- and polyvalent cations are more prominent for smaller rnas, such as riboswitches and ribozymes, which adopt compact and unique tertiary structures in the presence of mg2+ via formation of specific tertiary contacts. due to the heterogeneity of secondary structures in long rnas, such specific contacts would be harder to achieve, while also explaining why long rnas often require auxiliary proteins to guide their folding into a unique structure. long rnas exhibit a broad distribution of mlds, and the size of rna molecules can be estimated using coarse-grained theoretical predictions based on ensembles of predicted secondary structures and mld averaging, even in the presence of multivalent ions stabilizing tertiary contacts. this feature of rna, likely due to a limited repertoire of interactions offered by the four nucleobases, points to a fundamental limitation of rna as a complex biopolymer when compared to proteins."

pmc4222379,"study examined travel patterns of veterinarians, milk tanker drivers, artificial inseminators, maintenance technicians, and livestock hauliers in sweden. participating organizations provided data for professionals in each category and region, except for dairy service technicians and livestock hauliers who did not provide data from all regions. milk tankers visited most farms per week and traveled over the largest areas, while veterinarians traveled over the smallest areas. milk tankers could visit between 23 and 90 farms per week and travel over areas between 717 km² and 23,512 km² per week. the study indicates that a highly contagious disease could spread over a large area in the time span of one incubation period in sweden, and highlights the importance of indirect contacts for many diseases. the difficulties in contacting some professionals visiting farms could also pose a problem in outbreak situations."
pmc3589764,"individual hosts and species can make disproportionately large contributions to disease transmission, termed ""superspreaders"" and ""superspreading species"", respectively. these hosts and species are responsible for a greater than expected fraction of transmission events in a population, and identifying them before infecting others can greatly enhance disease control strategies. transmission heterogeneity occurs not only among hosts, but also across space, with certain locations or environmental conditions facilitating elevated transmission rates. these ""hotspots"" or ""foci"" can be analogous to superspreaders in their ability to amplify transmission and should be targeted in disease control efforts. transmission heterogeneity is intimately linked across scales, with host and spatial transmission heterogeneities influencing each other. understanding these connections will aid in developing an integrative theory for understanding transmission heterogeneity across scales. transmission heterogeneity can have important consequences for disease dynamics and host-pathogen evolution. for example, it can affect the probability of major outbreaks, slow epidemic growth rates, and alter the co-occurrence of diseases across host species. the causes of transmission heterogeneity, as well as the pathogen transmission modes most commonly associated with heterogeneity, are important avenues for further research. for example, heterogeneity in contact rates may be more important than heterogeneity in infectiousness, and environmental transmission heterogeneity may be more prevalent among pathogens with density-dependent transmission or environmentally transmitted stages."
pmc114243,"infection of pregnant sows with prrsv results in high rates of in utero infection and birth of viremic piglets, leading to increased mortality and susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection, particularly with staphylococcus suis type ii. piglets infected in utero with prrsv display severe immunosuppression, with reduced numbers of thymocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils in peripheral lymph nodes and bone marrow, as well as thymic involution. piglets infected in utero with prrsv and subsequently challenged with staphylococcus suis type ii have a significantly higher rate of mortality and infection compared to those infected with prrsv or staphylococcus suis type ii alone. the extreme susceptibility to staphylococcus suis type ii may stem from the age of the pig at the time of prrsv infection and the route of infection, as pigs infected at birth display more profound effects on the immune system and increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection. the exact mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility to staphylococcus suis type ii is not known, but may be related to changes in patterns of lymphocyte trafficking, loss of bactericidal function in tonsillar macrophages, or a loss of normal thymocyte development and selection processes."

pmc2739265,"in a study on the mechanisms of viral replication in cells, researchers identified a protein called lc3 as a key component in the replication of the virus bvdv. lc3 promotes the replication of bvdv by inducing the formation of double-stranded rna intermediates, which are necessary for viral replication. this discovery provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying viral replication and may lead to the development of new strategies for the treatment of viral infections. another study found that the viral protein ns2b, which is encoded by the human papillomavirus  hpv , interacts with the cellular protein e2f1 to promote viral replication. this interaction is required for the activation of the viral oncogene e6, which is involved in the transformation and cancer development associated with hpv infection. in a study on the role of autophagy in viral infection, researchers found that the autophagy protein atg5 is required for the replication of the virus hcv. atg5 promotes hcv replication by mediating the formation of double-stranded rna intermediates, which are necessary for viral replication. a study on the mechanism of viral assembly found that the viral protein vp1 of the virus hiv-1 interacts with the cellular protein tia1 to promote viral assembly. this interaction is required for the formation of infectious viral particles. in a study on the role of viral proteins in immune evasion, researchers found that the viral protein nsp1 of the virus chikungunya interacts with the cellular protein tbk1 to inhibit the activation of the host immune response. this interaction allows the virus to evade the host immune response and facilitate viral replication."
pmc2822845,"the study identified a new influenza virus strain, h1n1sw, in a french summer camp in 2009, which co-circulated with the pandemic h1n1 strain and showed a lower attack rate in children under 15 years old compared to the pandemic strain. the study found that the prevalence of antibodies to h1n1sw was low under 30 years of age, suggesting previous exposure to influenza virus es  antigenically related to the current h1n1sw strain, possibly before 1970 and potentially between the first and the second world war. the study found that the attack rate of infection among teenagers was 3 times the risk of the youngest  under 8 years old  and that the shedding of higher titres of virus by children was the major parameter associated with high attack rates. the study revealed that the mechanism of emergence of i106-d248 strains, which are currently dominant, remains unclear and may have emerged from a common ancestor or through convergent evolution towards id strains originating from various vn ancestors. the study found that the prevalence of antibodies to h1n1sw was similar in young adults supervising children and in children under 15 years old, but the attack rate observed in children  median age 11  was similar to that observed in young adults supervising them  median age 22 ."

pmc2446986,"to effectively infect humans, sars-cov needs to undergo two major adaptation mutations at residues 479 and 487 on rbd. the former largely determines whether sars-cov can infect humans, while the latter likely determines whether sars-cov can maintain sustained infections in humans. a common theme running through these two mutations is that a free charge embedded in a hydrophobic environment is energetically detrimental to virus/receptor binding, while once formed, a salt bridge in a hydrophobic environment is highly stabilizing due to the low dielectric constant of the hydrophobic environment. therefore, such free charges must be either neutralized or removed from the interface before effective viral infections can occur. the interactions between sars-cov and ace2 from other hosts, such as raccoons, domestic cats, ferrets, and monkeys, impose an important initial selection on sars-cov infections, while other host cell factors may impose selections on later steps of the infections. among the eight ace2s, human, cattle, orangutan, and monkey ace2s  with residues lys31 and asp38  appear to accommodate human viral strain htor02  with rbd residues asn479 and thr487  but not civet strain csz02  lys479 and ser487 , civet strain cgd05  arg479 and ser487 , or human strain hgd03  asn479 and ser487   table 2 . civets and raccoons have the widest range of accommodations for different sars-cov strains and, therefore, may play the most important roles in transmitting different sars-cov strains. these findings provide important initial evaluations of the interactions between sars-cov and ace2 from hosts other than humans and civets and highlight the need for future biochemical and structural studies to fully understand these virus-receptor interactions."
pmc6805739,"a study conducted in guinea found that while some participants strongly supported quarantine measures, 18% believed that quarantine should never be used, even in cases of highly contagious and lethal diseases. this finding echoes similar diversity among commentators in other contexts, such as in hong kong, singapore, taiwan, and the us, as well as in canada. the study also found that most participants  66%  believed that quarantine was justified if three criteria were met  the infected individuals were really contagious, the disease was lethal, and those in quarantine were provided with support services. this finding is consistent with those of previous studies in canada and taiwan, and reflects upshur's ethical framework for the justification of quarantine measures. the study found that providing support services to quarantined communities was crucial in ensuring compliance, as demonstrated by the high voluntary compliance with quarantine measures during the 2003 sars epidemics in taiwan, china, and canada. however, providing support services in low-resource contexts, such as in west africa, may be challenging due to poor infrastructures, severe deficiencies in logistical and transport systems, and lack of investment in needed supplies. the study also found that while the vast majority of respondents did not reject quarantine in an absolute manner, the opposition to quarantine can also be explained by more general doubts about the effectiveness and optimal use of social distancing measures. the study found that beliefs and social attributes associated with socio-demographic variables, such as gender, age, and religion, influenced the perception of quarantine. however, it is uncertain whether these beliefs and social attributes underlay respondents' position, and future studies using qualitative methods are needed to understand the respondents' justifications."
pmc3189341,"many viruses, including those causing serious human diseases, utilize sialic acid as a binding site for cell attachment. viruses achieve specificity for a single type of sialylated oligosaccharide through the formation of additional contacts with functional groups beyond the sialic acid itself, and by excluding some possible ligands through steric clashes. the viral attachment protein adenovirus fiber knob achieves selectivity for its gd1a glycan receptor by multivalent binding to a single receptor carrying two terminal sialic acid moieties separated by a defined spacer. the interaction between adenovirus fiber knob and its gd1a glycan receptor involves a bivalent interaction in which two protomers interact with the same receptor carrying two terminal sialic acid moieties separated by a defined spacer. structural analysis of the interaction between adenovirus fiber knob and its gd1a glycan receptor has led to the design and synthesis of a trivalent compound that blocks attachment of adenoviruses that cause ekc."
pmc2929207,"the study identified a few distinct csf proteins, some of which have biological functions that appear of direct interest for mscl, such as protein jagged-1 and vitamin d-binding protein. jagged-1 has been implicated in mscl, as its differential abundance was not observed in any of the pp mscl samples but small peaks of this peptide were detected in 6/11 rr mscl samples. vitamin d-binding protein has pleiotropic functions beyond vitamin d metabolism, as it can significantly enhance the chemotactic response to complement fragment c5a and has substantial stimulatory effects on macrophages. the study showed that serum levels of vitamin d-binding protein were decreased significantly in rr mscl patients compared to other neurological disorders. vitamin d, which directly and indirectly regulates the differentiation, activation of cd4+ t-lymphocytes, and can prevent the development of autoimmune processes, may be involved in mscl, as the neuroprotective function of vitamin d is increasingly recognized in the progressive phase of mscl pathogenesis. the study identified peptides of albumin and serotransferrin, but only 2.4% and 4.8% of the identified albumin and serotransferrin peptides, respectively, had p-values below 0.01. this indicates that the values for the peptides of these two particular proteins are most likely due to other reasons than large abundance differences in these two proteins, as most of the other differentially abundant proteins found to be differentially elevated in the comparisons of both mscl types with the controls were either identified by a single peptide with a low p-value or by a small number of peptides with a low p-value. the study identified ryanodine receptor 1, which is involved in the maintenance of the calcium-equilibrium in brain tissue. the release of toxic levels of positively charged calcium ions may represent a key mechanism of axonal degeneration in disorders such as mscl due to the deleterious effects of excitotoxicity. the study showed that apolipoprotein d is a lipocalin that is mainly expressed in glia, but also in neurons"
pmc5526166,"enos, an endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase, was found to be upregulated significantly through recombinant plasmid transfection in the mouse pancreatic β cell line min6, leading to increased sirt1 expression through direct protein-protein interaction. the present study showed that overexpressed enos promoted mouse pancreatic β cell proliferation and protected mouse pancreatic β cells from cell apoptosis, indicating a potential therapeutic target for diabetes. the study suggested that enos-mediated nitric oxide may regulate sirt1 expression during aging of endothelial cells, as the interaction of sirt1 and enos is important in the augmentation of the protective effect of statins against endothelial senescence. the findings also highlighted the importance of the interaction of sirt1 and enos in the augmentation of the protective effect of statins against endothelial senescence, as testosterone-induced enos activity increased sirt1 expression in endothelial cells in type 2 diabetic rats. the study implied that enos may induce sirt1 activation, which is indicated to have a protective role in endothelial cells, and that future research may focus on the identification of an effective drug playing a protective and therapeutic role for diabetes through the targeting of enos and regulation of sirt1."
pmc270701,"sars disproportionately affected healthcare workers and their families in icus, causing physical discomfort and emotional distress due to isolation and quarantine measures. the lack of accurate information and conflicting reports from authorities created confusion and lack of trust among healthcare workers, who had to balance patient needs with safety concerns. public health policies, such as mandatory isolation and quarantine measures, challenged notions of professional integrity and relationships with patients and families, leading to feelings of guilt and frustration. resource allocation during sars outbreaks required balancing patient needs with safety concerns, leading to difficult decisions about accepting or denying referrals and managing delays in transfer and treatment. the psychological distress experienced by patients, families, and healthcare workers during sars outbreaks underscores the need for contingency plans, access to scientific information, and ethical and practical frameworks to minimize damage and support all parties."
pmc3541562,"gene therapy using ribozymes, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, and small interfering rna  sirna  has shown promising results in targeting herpes simplex virus  hsv-1  genome and viral components, such as the reverse transcriptase, surface receptors, and replication proteins, for antiviral drug discovery. these approaches have demonstrated high specificity and efficiency in disrupting biological processes and preventing viral entry into cells. the delivery of genes encoding agents that are capable of disrupting numerous biological processes is a key concept in gene therapy. targeting the reverse transcriptase can block the transcription process, and viral surface receptors represent attractive targets, as well as other strategies such as the inhibition of dna polymerase, nuclear localisation signalling molecules, and protein-protein interactions. gene therapy for new targets, such as the inhibition of hsv-1 replication by sirnas against specific viral sequences, has shown promising results in animal models. the choice of the appropriate vector for targeting hsv-1 is essential for successful gene therapy, and the expression profile, bioavailability, biodegradability, and specificity of the vector are the main variables currently evaluated by several research groups. for chronic cases not requiring surgery, local application to the cornea is usually preferred, and the potential in the treatment of many genetic diseases and viral infections is progressively elevating the attention and awareness towards this new era of highly specialized treatment. choices are made based on the ability of the targeted cells to uptake the vector, expression of the transgene in a cell-specific manner, and maintenance of expression for the period of time needed to tackle the disease. pretreatment of corneas ex vivo in eye banks with specialized areas and trained staff is a new practical approach to corneal hsv-1 gene therapy that can help decrease transplants rejection due to chronic herpetic keratitis and minimize the risk of in vivo gene therapy."
pmc3754091,"the study identifies palmitoylation on conserved and nonconserved cysteines of mifitm1, a viral restriction factor, as a mechanism for regulating protein stability and abundance. palmitoylation on mifitm1 prevents its proteasomal degradation and promotes higher cellular levels of the protein, which is important as the protein is instable in the absence of palmitoylation. overexpression of the palmitoyltransferase zdhhc7, which increases palmitoylation, leads to a 4-fold increase in mifitm1 palmitoylation and a corresponding 1.8-fold increase in its protein level. the study shows that mutation of the three conserved cysteines of mifitm1 leads to an increased rate of infection compared to wt mifitm1, demonstrating a role for these cysteines in antiviral activity. the study reveals that palmitoylation of mifitm1 at the conserved and nonconserved cysteines is required for anti-influenza virus activity, increasing the support for an intramembrane topology with both n and c termini facing the cytoplasm."

pmc3196420,"the study reveals a previously uncharacterized functional domain in lmp1, called ctar3, which is critical for its interaction with the e3 ubiquitin ligase ubc9. deletion or overexpression of ctar3 inhibits the lmp1-ubc9 interaction, leading to decreased sumoylation of cellular proteins and reduced cell motility, respectively. the study demonstrates that lmp1 induces protein sumoylation, and this effect is lmp1-specific and not due to increased expression of ubc9. the study shows that approximately 80% less sumoylation of cellular proteins occurs when the lmp1-ubc9 interaction is inhibited, either by deletion of ctar3 or by overexpression of inactive ubc9. the study suggests that lmp1-induced protein sumoylation may modulate signal transduction pathways induced by ctar1 and ctar2."
pmc2659398,"this study demonstrates that the cgmmv vector has a preference for read-through codon signals, specifically the leaky uag codon. chimeric cgmmv transcripts utilizing this signal were not infectious, but a chimeric cgmmv carrying a read-through sequence from the wild-type cgmmv genome was infectious. this study also suggests that there is a preference for read-through codon signals between different species of tobamoviruses, as the leaky uag codon utilized by cgmmv is the same as the one used by tmv, the closest genome similarity to cgmmv. however, the study shows that the efficiency of the leaky uag codon for tmv is not high, as transcripts utilizing this signal for tmv were not infectious. this study shows that the order of removal of the transgene from a chimeric virus in a natural host is speculated to be the 5' to 3' direction. two additional nucleotides, together with the read-through sequence ""cc-aaa-tag,"" were detected downstream from the cgmmv cp orf. the study shows that the efficiency of the leaky uag codon for the chimeric cgmmv transcripts utilizing this signal was relatively high, giving a ratio of modified to unmodified cp of approximately 1 1. this is further supported by the detection of relatively equal yield of chimeric and wild-type cgmmv cp. this study provides a rational harvesting timeline for the chimeric virus carrying inserted foreign peptides, making this system exploitable for implementation in a plantation scale in the future. the study suggests that once host plants are infected with the chimeric virus carrying inserted foreign peptides, the optimum harvesting time would be at around 14 dpi or not more than 20 dpi in order to obtain maximum yield of the full-length transgene. growth of the infected plants for longer periods to obtain higher yields of the chimeric virus may induce unwanted transgene deletions."

pmc2876644,"the quantitative proteomics analysis identified 74 differentially expressed host proteins in response to sars-cov replication, with 14 of them also found to be altered at the mrna level. this study represents a complementary strategy for understanding the mechanisms by which sars-cov replicates in host cells, as previous studies have shown an approximately 60 to 80% discordance between mrna and protein abundances. among all differentially expressed host proteins, significantly upregulated bag3, a member of the bag cochaperone protein family, was selected for further functional studies. bag3 knockdown results in greatly diminished virus replication, suggesting the possibility that upregulation of bag3 may be part of the machinery that sars-cov relies on for replication. other proteins of interest uncovered in this study include 14-3-3 proteins, which have emerged as critical regulators of diverse cellular responses in eukaryotic organisms. the increase in 14-3-3 protein expression is likely part of the cell's response to sars-cov replication and appears to represent a homeostatic mechanism for cell defense. two regulatory molecules, cdc42 and rhoa, were found to be downregulated in replicon cells. modulation of sars-cov replication by cdc42 and rhoa may be mediated by the pi3k-mtor pathway, which is important for establishing persistent sars-cov infection in vero e6 cells. the quantitative proteomics analysis identified many host factors that potentially affect sars-cov replication, including 40s ribosomal subunits, 60s ribosomal subunits, and eif2s1, eif5b, and eif4a2. downregulation of the host translational machinery may play an important role in sars-cov replication in host cells."
pmc6398585,"spatial models that take into account the patterns of human spread and mobility can improve our ability to characterize and anticipate spatial expansion of infectious diseases. during the 2015-2016 yellow fever outbreak in central africa, estimates of geographic spread to provinces outside luanda, the capital of angola, were published over 6 months after the last cases were reported. this information could guide public health institutions to decide where and when to implement surveillance and control programs. the challenge to accurately reconstruct the epidemic pathway of the virus in the americas during the 2014-2017 zika outbreak was further complicated by its relatively unspecific clinical presentation. this may explain why the initial studies that aimed to understand the geographic origin of the zika epidemic in the americas were published over 1 year after the first reports of human cases. during the 2013-2017 middle east respiratory syndrome  mers  outbreak, estimates of geographic spread to provinces outside luanda, the capital of angola, were published over 6 months after the last cases were reported. this information could guide public health institutions to decide where and when to implement surveillance and control programs. integrating data sources, such as spatial, genomic, and epidemiological, can provide insights into heterogeneity in transmission and the characteristics of the inter-human transmission. for example, during the 2014-2017 zika outbreak in the americas, combining genomic data from the outbreak with epidemiological analysis revealed that the outbreak was driven by a large number of introductions rather than by persistent local transmission. the perceived ability of models to successfully or unsuccessfully make ‘correct’ predictions can generate considerable controversy. there are few studies that systematically investigate forecasting accuracy and its relationship to the length of time that is being predicted and to the quantity and quality of data available. this is an important area for future research."
pmc4713849,"in the outbreak of mers-cov in the republic of korea, most clinical laboratories had sufficient capacity to respond to the outbreak, with immediate testing available seven days a week. the median turnaround time for mers-cov rt-pcr testing was less than six hours, and results were reported within 24 hours in all medical institutions except one. the majority of clinical laboratories  75%  used phosphate-buffered saline  pbs  for pretreatment of sputum specimens. most laboratories  85%  used commercial lysis kits or systems for mers-cov rt-pcr testing, with the kogenebiotech powerchek mers-cov real-time pcr kit being the most commonly used. in response to the mers-cov outbreak, class ii biosafety cabinets were adequately supplied, but high-end engineering facilities such as negative pressure sputum collection and pretreatment rooms were not readily available. however, no laboratory-acquired infections were reported during the outbreak, indicating that standard precautions with droplet precautions were sufficient for the prevention of laboratory-acquired infection of mers-cov. the number of positive results from mers-cov rt-pcr testing was significantly higher in specimens obtained from the lower respiratory tract  1.01%  compared with specimens from the upper respiratory tract  0.6% . this highlights the importance of using lower respiratory tract specimens for mers-cov diagnosis, as recommended by the laboratory diagnostic guidelines for mers-cov testing in the republic of korea. the survey contributes to the comprehensive view of clinical laboratory responses to the recent mers-cov outbreak in the republic of korea. the results suggest that clinical laboratories in korea were able to expand their diagnostic capacity in a short time and achieve a turnaround time of less than nine hours, with testing available seven days a week, to respond to the mers-cov outbreak. however, improvements in engineering laboratory biosafety are needed for preparedness to test agents with a higher biosafety level."
pmc3867435,"the study reports the first isolation and complete genome sequence of the chikungunya virus in zhejiang, china, in 2012. the study reveals that the chikungunya virus in zhejiang is distributed inside the southeast asian clade that initially spread from india, and it shares its greatest identity with a strain imported to taiwan from indonesia. the study suggests that the chikungunya virus in zhejiang is distributed inside the southeast asian clade that initially spread from india, and it diverged along two different routes  one to southeast asia from the 1950s to 1980s where it became locally endemic, and the other through the indian ocean to southeast asia and europe. the study indicates that there is no mutation from alanine to valine in the e1 226 position in the chikungunya virus in zhejiang, while there were many alanine-to-valine substitutions in e1 glycoprotein isolates in the indian ocean lineage. the study highlights the need for more detailed molecular epidemiology data to further understand, monitor, and evaluate the threats to the zhejiang region as more imported viruses emerge and are detected in china.  bonus finding  the study proposes a modified workflow using cdna-aflp for virus discovery, involving two steps  sample pre-processing, including wga and ethanol precipitation for purification, and library construction using platinum taq for substitutions, with added quality control steps to ensure sample concentration. this modified method is suitable for determining an unrecognized viral agent in samples from patients of great medical interest or novel viral pathogens in some circumstances."

pmc3544582,"the study found that school-level transmission of influenza, as measured by classroom-based fever surveillance using fri reporting by teachers, is more common than school-wide transmission, as measured by daily monitoring of temperature in schools. this finding suggests that classroom-level transmission may dominate, and that fri reporting by teachers in schools could be a useful method for detecting transmission clusters during future pandemics or severe seasonal influenza epidemics. the study also revealed wide-spread variation in fri rates at the level of classrooms, but not schools. this finding highlights the potential accuracy and usefulness of fri reporting by teachers in schools for monitoring influenza epidemics and may be particularly useful in resource-poor settings due to the minimal costs involved. the study further revealed that notifications of laboratory-confirmed influenza  sch-lcc  and school-wide daily monitoring of temperature  sch-dtm  were unlikely to have detected a sufficient fraction of influenza cases to allow effective school-level interventions. this finding suggests that school-based fri reporting by teachers at sentinel schools could be a more feasible and effective method for detecting transmission clusters during future pandemics or severe seasonal influenza epidemics when interventions such as school closures and targeted administration of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis are being considered. the study also found that not all presentations of acute respiratory illness, including self-reported febrile respiratory illness in children, were included in the serological surveys used for comparison in other countries following a single epidemic wave. this finding highlights the need for more comprehensive and representative serological surveys to accurately estimate influenza incidence rates in future pandemics or severe seasonal influenza epidemics. the study also noted that the estimates of infection rates in the study were fairly similar to other serological surveys of corresponding age groups in other countries following a single epidemic wave. however, the study also highlighted the need for more comprehensive and representative serological surveys to accurately estimate influenza incidence rates in future pandemics or severe seasonal influenza epidemics, as the data used to adjust for the sensitivity of the hi assay was based on results from adults, and there was a lack of data specific to younger populations."

pmc7002972,"the study demonstrated that icariin, a natural compound extracted from horny goat weed, promoted osteogenic differentiation in bone marrow-derived stem cells  bmscs  through the upregulation of the circadian clock gene bmal1 and its downstream target bone morphogenetic protein 2  bmp2  signaling pathway. the study found that icariin at a concentration range between 10^-9^ and 10^-5^ mol/l significantly promoted the proliferation of bmscs, especially at 10^-7^ mol/l. the study revealed that reduced expression of bmp2/runx2 was observed during osteogenic differentiation of bmscs with bmal1 deficiency, and mineralized nodule formation was suppressed both in bmscs with bmal1 deficiency and in icariin-mediated bmscs with bmal1 deficiency. the study suggested that bmal1 deficiency decreased bmp2 expression during osteogenic differentiation of bmscs, and the disorder and downregulation of clock genes may be the cause of disease, and in some cases could also be used as a target of drug action to improve disease symptoms and treat disease. the study highlighted the potential of icariin as a novel preventive and therapeutic agent for circadian clock-related diseases, as it demonstrated the bone-strengthening activity of icariin and its potential mechanism via which osteogenic differentiation is mediated between icariin and bmal1."
pmc2725845,"the study found that the newly created large and small influenza-like illness  ili  groups based on correlation with positive respiratory pathogen specimens and signal-to-noise ratio had very similar temporal trends during each of the previous three seasons when compared to nationwide centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  sentinel providers surveillance network data. the study identified that approximately half of the international classification of diseases, ninth revision  icd-9  codes within the ili syndrome group were associated with specimens positive for respiratory pathogens, including influenza, and that most codes followed the same temporal trends over time as positive specimens. the study recommended that health agencies use the ili-large and ili-small groups as a model for developing similar systems, but emphasized that developers perform critical analysis of the individual codes collected in their data and carefully consider which diagnoses are more likely to cause background ""noise"" rather than contribute to the signal. the study found that the less-specific ili-large group may be more useful for the initial detection of influenza season and for detecting other respiratory illnesses that initially cause similar symptoms, whereas the ili-small group is more specific but also more likely to signal slightly later than the large group because providers should use these codes cautiously until influenza cases have been confirmed. the study supported evidence that using nontraditional electronic data for syndromic surveillance may enable health providers to recognize and detect the influenza season faster than with traditional means. the study also emphasized the importance of critical review in defining and assessing syndrome groupings for icd-9-based surveillance, as developers parse, analyze, and interpret their own data."

pmc2916077,"the study presents a host cell-based assay system for general detection of enveloped viruses based on lipid raft-mediated uptake of the reporter gene by the virus. the natural gpi-anchor of placental alkaline phosphatase can be incorporated effectively into the membrane of diverse enveloped virus particles. the system described allows the detection of multiple enveloped viruses, as it is based on expression of the reporter in trans, thus enabling the detection of multiple viruses. the study offers several advantages, including the ability to detect and subsequently analyze enveloped viruses without prior reference to their composition, and the fact that it allows the detection of multiple enveloped viruses that bud from the plasma membrane. one limitation of this system is cell culture adaptation as a pre-requisite for virus screening, as vero cells have proven as suitable host for multiple cell culture adapted viruses, but may not be suitable for all enveloped viruses, and in such cases, the use of alternate hosts such as mrc5 or mdck cells can be explored."
pmc2268373,"this study developed a multitarget approach for ar preparation, which allows for the simultaneous amplification of three respiratory viruses in a single reaction mixture, including influenza a virus, influenza b virus, and sars-cov. the method involves the design of specific primers and probes to amplify highly conserved regions of the matrix gene, which are then packaged into ar-2. this approach enables almost all influenza viruses with different serum types to be detected in a real-time rt-pcr format, making it suitable for screening of influenza a and b viruses at the molecular level. the current ar purification method, which involves the combined use of gradient ultracentrifugation, column chromatography, and co2+ affinity chromatography, is efficient and easy to operate compared to traditional cscl fractionation methods. ar-2 is purified as an rna-protein complex and electroeluted from an agarose gel with a gebaflex tube, which allows for a higher sensitivity in multiplex real-time rt-pcr assays. the positive coincidence rate for the multiplex real-time rt-pcr format was 96.8% among 290 respiratory samples for influenza a virus, 95.3% among 80 respiratory samples for influenza a virus, and no bni 1 fragment-positive samples were monitored. the average ct values for the three genes in single primer-probe reactions were 25.92, 26.46, and 26.95 for the am, bm, and bni 1 fragments in single primer-probe reactions, respectively, and the average ct values for the three genes in the multiplex format were 26.07, 26.34, and 27.15 for the fam, hex, or rox channels, respectively. the current ar preparation method provides a means of evaluating all steps of the assay, as ar-2 could provide a safe, stable, and physically characteristic substitute for the three target viruses within the respective real-time rt-pcr assays. ar-2 is able to mimic the natural virus within the respective real-time rt-pcr assays for each of the"

pmc5069963,"culture-independent molecular methods have revealed vastly greater microbial diversity in indoor environments compared to traditional culture- and microscopy-based methods. indoor air in buildings contains a smaller quantity of culturable bacteria than what is found outdoors, and indoor air includes a combination of mostly gram-positive cocci and rods. indoor spaces often harbor unique microbial communities in ways that we did not previously understand. for example, indoor air samples from 29 homes in san francisco, ca, contained major contributions from nearly 20 other taxa ranging from comamonadaceae to methylocystaceae, with staphylococcus making up only ~4% of the identifiable taxa in indoor air. human and pet sources dominate indoor bacterial communities, and humans are also major sources of bacteria to indoor surfaces and indoor air. for example, repeated studies of varied indoor environments have used source-tracking algorithms to illustrate that humans  and pets, if present  often dominate bacterial communities found on indoor surfaces. building design and operation can influence indoor microbial communities. for example, spaces with a high human occupant diversity and a high degree of physical connectedness to other spaces contained a unique collection of bacterial taxa compared to spaces with low levels of connectedness and occupant diversity. exposures to the “right” number of the “right” kinds of microbes may be beneficial for human health. for example, mice exposed to dog-associated house dust had a distinct gut microbiome composition and were protected against airway allergen challenges, and lower fungal diversity in house dust was significantly associated with childhood asthma development in a small case-control study."

pmc3317351,"viruses, such as adenovirus and herpes simplex virus 1  hsv-1 , use caspase cleavage as a mechanism to combat apoptosis. in some cases, such as in hsv-1 variants, caspase cleavage leads to viral attenuation by generating new viral products acting as dominant negatives of non-structural proteins  ns1  or unfit for virus packaging when structural proteins are concerned. conversely, in other viruses, such as adenovirus and human papillomavirus  hpv , caspase cleavage allows the removal of specific regions that reveal or eliminate functional domains or signals. in some instances, such as in amv d120 mutant, caspase cleavage leads to full viral amplification, as seen in ns1 protein of amv. the functional consequences of some viral protein caspase cleavages still remain debated or elusive due to the difficulty of investigating hazardous entities, such as influenza and human cytomegalovirus  hcmv , the multitude of strains and genotypes, or the lack of appropriate tools, such as cellular or animal models allowing to recapitulate the viral life cycle, such as in tgev and mcv. viral protein caspase cleavage probably allows the removal of specific regions that reveal or eliminate functional domains or signals. for example, in mcv, caspase cleavage leads to the generation of an additional product  mr35,000  acting as a dominant negative of ns proteins or unfit for virus packaging when structural proteins are concerned  mcv capsid protein . viruses use caspase cleavage as a strong strategy to handle apoptosis due to its direct combat against apoptosis, as seen in acmnpv and wssv. viruses, such as hsv-1 and hpv, express proteins acting as strong and broad inhibitor caspase substrates. viruses prove their fascinating adaptability by managing to use the molecular effectors of apoptosis to protect themselves from eradication without any additional genetic information required. caspase-related products, such as structural or non-structural proteins, are mostly stable and suggest they are"
pmc4829150,"this study demonstrates a novel equilibrium in the vascular wall of ace2-deficient mice through processes associated with increased aortic oxidative stress and decreased •no bioavailability, leading to endothelial dysfunction. the study reveals a drastic reduction in •no availability in ace2-deficient mice, which is caused by two different effects of ace2 depletion  a reduction in active enos and an inactivation of •no by ros. the study shows that endothelial dysfunction in ace2-deficient mice is associated with increased local and systemic tbars levels, indicating increased lipid peroxidation. the study reveals that ace2-deficient mice show a significant decrease in ucp2 mrna levels in aorta, which may directly contribute to the increase in ros bioavailability and decreased •no bioavailability, leading to endothelial dysfunction. the study provides insights into the role of ace2 in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis and the role of the ras in both vascular and systemic redox balance, highlighting ace2/ang- 1–7 /mas axis as a potential target for the development of novel cardiovascular protective and/or antioxidant drugs."

pmc1200711,"plague, caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis, has a long history of causing social and economic devastation, with an estimated 200 cases annually reported worldwide. plague is essentially a disease of wild rodents that is transmitted by fleas, and control of this wild animal population is inherently difficult, as the burrows are often located in inaccessible areas. plague is not a major health concern at present, but it persists due to its epidemiology, as the infected animal reservoir could be completely destroyed, but this would not guarantee the extinction of the disease, as y. pestis can survive in animal carcasses and litter for several years, thus being a source of reinfection of other rodents. concerns have been raised about the possibility of bioengineered organisms resistant to standard antibiotics used for treatment and prophylaxis, as multidrug-resistant plague bacilli have recently occurred naturally. the recent emergence of variant strains and the possibility of resistance to current treatment regimens should lead to continuous research on y. pestis and identification of possible new treatment modalities, as the medical community as well as the public should be educated about the basic infectious disease epidemiology and control measures to increase the possibility of a calm and reasoned response if an outbreak should occur."
pmc3163493,"in a study published in nature communications, researchers have used cryogenic electron microscopy  cryo-em  to reveal the structure of a virus, herpes simplex virus  hsv , during its entry into mammalian cells. the findings shed light on the distinct structural rearrangements of the virus core and its surface spikes during assembly and maturation. the study also revealed similar membrane recruiting subunits in the major capsid protein  mcp  of hsv and vaccinia virus  vv , but with different outcomes, as hsv mcp forms membrane-containing viruses while vv d13 is a scaffold that leaves the membrane during virus maturation and is not present in viruses. a study published in the journal of structural biology used cryo-em to capture the release mechanism of stiv, a virus that causes pyramid-like protrusions on the surface of cells. the study found that a single viral protein was sufficient to induce pyramid formation, even in the absence of virus infection. the pyramids have sevenfold symmetry and display sharp facets, and the process of pyramid protruding out of a thinning cell wall and perturbing the s-layer was also captured by cryo-em. in a study published in the journal of virology, researchers used cryo-em and electron microscopy  em  to follow the assembly of flock house virus  fhv  in insect cells. the study allowed viral arrays to be visualized with both fluorescence and em analysis and showed that heavily modified mitochondria were the sites of viral rna replication. a study published in the journal of structural biology used cryo-em to reveal the structure of the inner-membrane-containing particles of stiv and vaccinia virus  vv . the study found that the similar inner-membrane-containing particles are visualized, and the similar tertiary structures of the stiv mcp and vv d13 protein share similar folds. the study also showed that virus factories or viroplasm have been reported in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems where proteins and newly synthesized genomes are confined within specific compartments for efficient viral re"

pmc415820,"mhv infection results in the inhibition of dna synthesis and cell cycle progression in the g0/g1 phase, leading to the accumulation of cells in these phases. mhv infection reduces the amounts of g1 cyclins, resulting in decreased cdk4/6 and cdk2 activities, which blocks cell cycle progression in the g0/g1 phase. mhv infection induces a reduction in the amounts of g1 cyclins through both transcriptional and translational mechanisms. mhv-induced cell cycle arrest potentially has additional important biological significance for virus-induced pathogenicity as noncycling cells are less likely to be killed efficiently by cytotoxic t cells. mhv-induced cell cycle arrest potentially assists in efficient mhv assembly by providing increased amounts of ribonucleotide pools for efficient mhv rna synthesis, as ribonucleotides are the precursors for synthesizing deoxyribonucleotides, and a reduction in cellular dna synthesis most likely increases the levels of ribonucleotide pools in cells."
pmc4959078,"the study evaluated the kinetics of inactivation of bacillus subtilis subsp. niger spores and salmonella typhimurium by chlorine dioxide  cio2  gas using a mathematical model. the findings showed that the survival curves exhibited a nonlinear behavior, with a downward concavity  shoulder  for b. subtilis subsp. niger spores and an upward concavity  tailing  for s. typhimurium. this suggests that spores are more resistant to cio2 than vegetative bacteria during the early phase of inactivation. the study also found that the inactivation efficiency of cio2 gas was higher under conditions of high relative humidity  rh , with a more rapid improvement in inactivation efficiency at rh values above 70%. this is attributed to the fact that water vapor condenses onto the surface of the organism, acting as a carrier for cio2 gas, and swelling of spores increases the diameter of the channel for access of gases into spores, expanding the spore coat to improve penetrability. the study established a mathematical model, the weibull-h model, to reveal the tendencies and kinetics of inactivation by cio2 gas under different rh conditions. the model produced a better fit to the survival curve than the first-order model under different concentrations of cio2 gas. the study calculated the time required to achieve a six-log reduction based on the established models. the findings showed that b. subtilis subsp. niger spores were more resistant to cio2 gas and required longer treatment times for effective inactivation than salmonella typhimurium. the study's findings will be useful for clarifying the effective conditions for cio2 gas required to inactivate airborne pathogens in contaminated air and other environments."

pmc2790717,"ole and ht inhibit the fusion-promoting refolding of gp41, a hydrophobic pocket on the inner core of hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein, by binding to it. this pocket is highly conserved among different hiv-1 clades, and ole and ht are active against a panel of hiv-1 primary isolates that includes both m and t tropic strains from different clades. ole and ht are small molecules with molecular weights of 539 and 153, respectively, and their inhibition of the fusion-promoting refolding of gp41 is an excellent example of how small molecules can block formation of protein-protein complexes. ole and ht can also be easily prepared from natural olive leaf extract in only two steps  deglycosylation and oxidation, or by chemical synthesis involving only two steps  acetylation and reduction. the fact that ole and ht act both outside and inside of the cellular environments in viral entry and integration offers unique benefits to these small molecules against viral resistance. ole and ht may be useful against other viruses with type i transmembrane envelope glycoprotein, including sars-associated coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, ebola virus, measles virus, and avian flu virus. fuzeon, the only fda-approved hiv-1 fusion inhibitor, is a peptide derived from the chr region of gp41 that partially overlaps with the c34 sequence. however, its manufacturing process is very complex, involving 106 chemical steps."
pmc3502135,"this study identified that the general public in melbourne, australia had a good understanding of the clinical features of pandemic influenza and of the precautions required to minimize its spread in the community. health literacy and behavior change were reportedly well emphasized in the dhs campaign. however, 70% of respondents thought that pregnant women and indigenous groups were not vulnerable groups, despite being central dhs messages at the onset of the outbreak and during vaccination campaigns. the study showed that 85% of respondents believed that the government and media had provided sufficient information about pandemic influenza, but that the message was repetitive and led to loss of interest in the issue. ""pandemic fatigue"" is of concern because it may lead to decreased risk perception and may explain the attitude of the study's participants towards government and media on the matter. the study found that only 40% of respondents intended to adhere to government recommendations in case of a future pandemic, and that only 40% of respondents believed that future pandemics would be serious enough to mandate preventative measures. campaigns should address the feeling of exaggeration and the loss of interest to ensure prompt compliance with pandemic measures. the study showed that only 20% of respondents had received the new vaccine, despite 80% knowing about it. this is consistent with kamate's study on sars in india, where only 16% of the population would want to be vaccinated. the study found that use of traditional mass media was prevalent, whereas new technology such as twitter updates was not. the use of the internet, mainly composed of viewing online newspapers, was higher than other pandemic studies. for example, kim's study on sars in 2003 showed only 3% of the population had access to the internet to find out about the disease. it is surprising that higher results were not obtained for newer forms of communication since this sample was composed of relatively young people with a median age of 36. thus, it would appear that future campaigns should still emphasize traditional modes of communication."

pmc3228346,"the majority of zoonotic pathogens infect and are amplified by multiple reservoir species, despite the tendency to focus on a single ""primary"" reservoir species. reservoir species are qualitatively high-quality patches that make a positive contribution to the overall abundance of the zoonotic pathogen. however, each reservoir species has a quantitatively different impact on pathogen abundance and human disease risk. dilution species negatively impact the abundance of pathogens and can decrease human disease risk. this can occur by reducing rates of encounter between pathogens and reservoir species, regulating the abundance of reservoir species, or regulating the abundance of vectors. vector-borne diseases comprise some of the most virulent human diseases, and transmission can be enhanced by debilitating symptoms as immobilized hosts are poorer at avoiding mosquito bites than are asymptomatic hosts, resulting in longer feeding bouts that increase the probability of acquiring blood-borne pathogens. species that play no direct role in increasing or diluting pathogen abundance can affect pathogen abundance by regulating the density, distribution, and timing of resources for reservoir hosts."
pmc6767964,"a study conducted in saudi arabia has provided molecular evidence of influenza a virus infection in dromedary camels imported from sudan and djibouti, but not in locally raised camels. the study detected viral rna from both male and female camels of various ages, suggesting that dromedary camels could serve as a potential unknown host and zoonotic source for influenza a viruses. the study found that viral rna was detected in both male and female camels of various ages, indicating that dromedary camels could potentially serve as a host for influenza a viruses. the study detected viral rna from camels arriving from two different african countries, sudan and djibouti, at multiple time points over two years, which reduces the possibility of environmental contamination or simple respiratory exposure to infected humans or animals. the study suggests that dromedary camels could be a source of influenza a virus transmission to other livestock, highlighting the need for enhanced field surveillance for influenza a viruses as well as other pathogens in dromedary camels to implement better preventative one-health plans and programs."
pmc6315117,"the study found that veov infection in astrocytes leads to a delay in the cell cycle, primarily at the g0/g1 phase, due to a block in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking caused by the viral capsid binding to host cell import and export proteins. the study found that veov infection results in decreased expression of cyclins and cdks, which are necessary for progression through the cell cycle, leading to cell cycle delay. the study found that veov infection in astrocytes leads to decreased expression of cyclin d1, which is necessary for entry into g1, and rb phosphorylation, which is regulated by cyclin e2 and cdk2. the study found that veov infection in astrocytes leads to a decrease in cyclin e and a expression at both the mrna and protein levels. the study found that veov infection in astrocytes results in decreased expression of cyclin d1 protein levels, but not mrna expression, and that a block in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking may be influencing the expression of transcription factors, cell cycle regulators, and/or mitotic assembly factors affected following veov infection."

pmc2878213,"in the context of pandemic influenza, the study found that travel restrictions can delay the spread of the disease between cities by several weeks, but this delay is highly sensitive to assumptions about the transmissibility of the influenza virus and demographic factors such as city sizes, travel rates, and the origin of travelers. the study suggests that travel restrictions could have a greater effect in more isolated communities that lack international ports, as these communities may have lower effective values of the reproduction number and shorter average times between infections. the study found that moderate delays in the pandemic could be achievable when the epidemic growth rate is low, but if the estimated growth rate is high, the additional median delay between 20 cases occurring in city 1 and 20 cases occurring in city 2 might be just 3 days, providing little benefit from longer term implementation of travel restrictions. the study found that travel restrictions would be most applicable for extended use in the protection of small, relatively isolated centers due to the strong influence of epidemic growth rates and demographic factors such as city sizes, travel rates, and the origin of travelers on delays induced by internal border control. the study highlights that travel restrictions would be ineffective if frequent importations are not considered, as this could greatly reduce the benefits of internal restrictions for cities with international airports or ports."
pmc6277082,"a novel amirna-based therapy against the emerging jev virus has been developed using vector-delivered amirnas targeted against the conserved 3' untranslated region  utr  of jev. the amirna-based therapy was found to efficiently inhibit jev replication in neuronal cells, with the amirna #2 seed sequence exhibiting the most significant inhibitory effect. the amirna #2-mediated effect was sequence specific and did not induce an additional interferon-stimulated gene  isg  response compared to control. the amirna #1-mediated effect as observed in the study may be the combined result of both sequences, specific as well as isg-mediated response. the amirna-based therapy offers a proof of concept for the development of novel amirna-based therapeutics against emerging jev, due to the unique benefits provided by the polymerase-ii-promoter-driven plasmid vector used, which provides comparatively less toxic rnai molecules inside the cells."

pmc3302375,"the study identified a diverse range of viruses in pine marten and european badger feces, including viruses from the orders caudovirales, picornavirales, paramyxoviridae, parvoviridae, and microviridae. the study also discovered a new potential mycovirus in european badgers. the study revealed that the majority of bacteriophage sequences in pine martens and european badgers belonged to the order caudovirales and to single-stranded dna viruses in the family microviridae, as was observed before in viral metagenomics studies of the feces of horses, humans, and california sea lions. the study identified a new potential mycovirus in european badgers and a new anellovirus from pine marten rectal swabs, as well as a new potential circovirus-like virus from european badgers. the study found that the newly identified pine marten anellovirus belongs to a new genus within the anellovirus family, which was provisionally named xitorquevirus in analogy to the classification of torque teno viruses in nine genera named alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, eta-, iota-, theta-, and zetatorquevirus, and the proposed four genera kappa-, lambda-, mu-, and nutorquevirus. the study discovered a new potential bocavirus from pine marten feces, representing a new bocavirus species. the discovery of these viruses highlights the need for expanding our knowledge of virus diversity present in the animal reservoir, as sequence-independent amplification of viral nucleic acid in combination with a next-generation sequencing platform provides a relatively simple, unselective technology to identify new viral species, as was observed previously with similar techniques."
pmc3480482,"the study identified a novel protein family that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of a bacterial infection. analysis of the genome sequences in the seed database revealed the presence of previously unknown bacterial strains that are closely related to known human pathogens. the investigation uncovered a new mechanism by which virulence factors in bacterial infections are regulated. the study demonstrated the effectiveness of a new approach for the treatment of bacterial infections, using a seed compound that has been previously identified through the use of the seed servers. the analysis of the metabolic models in the seed database provided insights into the metabolic pathways that are disrupted during bacterial infections, suggesting potential targets for the development of novel antibacterial therapies."
pmc1913238,"the study synthesized and evaluated novel β-l-deoxycytidine analogues, including β-l-hyd4c, hy3tc, and β-l-hyddc, as potential anti-hepatitis b  hbv  agents. the study found that β-l-hyd4c was the most effective anti-hbv agent, with an inhibitory concentration  ic50  of 0.03 μm, followed by hy3tc  ic50, 0.51 μm  and β-l-hyddc  ic50, 0.55 μm . the study also evaluated the triphosphates of these compounds and found that the ic50 of β-l-hyd4c triphosphate was 0.9 μm, while the ic50s of hy3tc and β-l-hyddc triphosphates were 0.21 μm and 0.99 μm, respectively. the study found that the cytotoxicity of these compounds was much lower than their anti-hbv activity, indicating a unique and high selectivity index. the study suggests that the 4-nhoh group of the β-l-deoxycytidine derivatives, including β-l-hyd4c and some other derivatives, is responsible for the strong inhibition by their triphosphates, and further investigation is warranted as potential anti-hbv agents."
pmc1895271,"electron microscopy and immunofluorescence staining showed that both mature and immature dendritic cells  dcs  can be infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  sars-cov , suggesting that cell types lacking ace2, the functional receptor for sars-cov, may also be infected by sars-cov, and other receptors may be involved in virus entry. initial postgenomic characterization of the sars-cov revealed 23 potential n-linked glycosylation sites, some of which are of high-mannose structure. this finding suggests that cell-mediated transfer of retroviral vectors pseudotyped with the sars-cov spike  s  protein can bind to dc-sign and enter mature dcs, further supporting an important role played by dcs in sars-cov replication. sars-cov infection in dcs appears to be incomplete, as there was expression of the viral genome, including negative and positive strand rna templates, but no increase in viral copies over 6 days of culture, no virus budding, or production of infectious virus into the culture medium. sars-cov infection in dcs did not induce significant cell death under light and electron microscopy or in active caspase-3 assays, suggesting that the immunosuppressive effect of sars-cov may not be mediated through direct cytopathic effect on dcs. sars-cov infection in dcs did not up-regulate the expression of cd83, cd86, mhc class i, or mhc class ii molecules on immature dcs, but maturation of sars-cov-infected dcs can still be induced by lps, suggesting that sars-cov did not impair dc maturation."
pmc4801244,"the current study identifies the chimeric sars-like virus wiv1-cov as a potential threat for future emergence in human populations due to robust replication in primary human airway epithelial cell cultures. in vivo studies in transgenic mice with airway-targeted overexpression of human ace2 reveal that wiv1-cov replication is attenuated in mice expressing human ace2, whereas it replicates efficiently in mice lacking human ace2. studies in aged mice reveal that wiv1-cov replication is attenuated in aged mice, whereas it replicates efficiently in young mice. studies in transgenic mice with airway-targeted overexpression of human ace2 reveal that wiv1-cov replication is attenuated in mice expressing human ace2, whereas it replicates efficiently in mice lacking human ace2, and that aged mice have a reduced capacity to control wiv1-cov infection compared to young mice. studies in transgenic mice with airway-targeted overexpression of human ace2 reveal that wiv1-cov replication is attenuated in mice expressing human ace2, whereas it replicates efficiently in mice lacking human ace2, and that the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of wiv1-cov is critical for efficient replication in human airway epithelial cells and in mice."
pmc1900074,"the sars-cov genome encodes eight putative accessory proteins, including the 7a protein. while most of these viral proteins are expressed during sars-cov infection, they appear to be dispensable for viral replication in cell culture and the mouse model. the overexpression of the sars-cov 7a accessory protein induces apoptosis in a caspase-3-dependent manner. the efficient cleavage of the signal peptide of 7a suggests that newly synthesized 7a translocates first to the endoplasmic reticulum. the sars-cov 7a protein interacts predominantly with aa 224 and 225 within the c-terminal transmembrane domain of bcl-xl, a prosurvival member of the bcl-2 family. the replacement of a critical residue within this domain  y101→k  reduces the strength of the interaction significantly. besides the 7a and envelope proteins, numerous other sars-cov proteins, such as the 3c-like protease, spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane, have also been shown to induce apoptosis. some of these viral proteins, such as envelope, nucleocapsid, and membrane, induce apoptosis only in the absence of growth factors, while others, such as 3c-like protease, spike, and orfs 3a, 3b, and 7a, induce apoptosis under normal growth conditions. the overexpression of the prosurvival member of the bcl-2 family, bcl-xl, can block the induction of apoptosis by the sars-cov envelope protein. however, the induction of apoptosis by these viral proteins and their relative contributions to sars-cov-induced apoptosis have not been investigated in detail."
pmc1186024,"the study provides evidence for isolation by distance in the spatial pattern of genetic variation in fox rabies virus variants in southern ontario, canada. the analysis reveals a very strong correlation between pair-wise genetic distances and pair-wise geographic distances, indicating a pattern of isolation by distance. the study identifies two distinct viral age groups  one older virus population circulating in the northeast and one younger population circulating in the southwest. the age-distance relationship was computed against a fixed geographic location to define subgroup distances, and within each subgroup, there is a genetic distance-geographic distance relationship. the study suggests that the spatial organization of sequence variants is best explained largely as a consequence of isolation by distance rather than local adaptation. although the hypothesis of local adaptation generating spatial genetic organization of populations must be evaluated against an appropriate null model based on isolation by distance, the current analysis suggests that approximately 90% of the geographic structure of the ontario rabies virus population can be attributed to isolation by distance rather than local adaptation. the study provides evidence for the reduction in isolation by distance in the southern region of ontario due to multiple waves of infection crossing the southern peninsula, but restricted transmission back into the eastern sections of ontario. this would lead to increased mixing among the southern isolates of the virus and the disruption of isolation by distance. the study suggests that two populations of virus of slightly different age exist on the ontario peninsula, each showing isolation by distance within their respective endemic regions, indicative of the historical dynamics of fox rabies spread during its decent into southern ontario. each population shows reduced isolation by distance within their respective endemic regions."
pmc3100509,"this study, which compared data from a temperate and a subtropical climate, found a consistent association between seasonal influenza circulation and acute myocardial infarction  mi -associated hospitalizations and deaths in two different settings characterized by differing populations, climates, and patterns of health-seeking behavior. the study estimated that up to 5.6% of mi-associated deaths in hong kong and 3.4% in england and wales were attributed to influenza, with the effect of influenza on mi occurring mainly in elderly persons who are relatively highly vaccinated. the study found that acute cardiac events should be considered when anticipating influenza outbreaks, and that differences in consulting behavior may explain the reduced reporting delay in hong kong influenza data. the study showed that associations between influenza and mi-associated deaths and hospitalizations were most marked in the oldest-aged persons, who are more likely to have extensive underlying coronary disease. the study found that after the severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  outbreak in 2003, official advice in hong kong was to consult a doctor as soon as influenza-like symptoms are experienced, which could potentially have a greater impact on mi events due to influenza outbreaks."
pmc3497641,"this study identified linear determinants as the main targets of chikungunya virus  chikv  antibodies in infected individuals, which are more easily identifiable in a medium-throughput approach. the antibody response against linear determinants was attributed to a persisting igg3 response, which was detectable even at 21 months post-infection  p.i. . this study found that only three structural proteins  capsid protein and e2 and e3 glycoproteins  and one nonstructural protein  nsp3  contained linear epitopes recognized by patient anti-chikv antibodies. computational analysis revealed that the differential binding capacity of patient plasma antibodies to different chikv isolates with different epitope sequences could be due to a loss of epitope-antibody binding capacity when the amino acid at position 252 is changed from q to k between sgp11 and imt isolates. this study showed that the chikv e2 glycoprotein epitope recognized by patient anti-chikv antibodies, between amino acids 2800 and 2818, is still detectable at 21 months p.i., making it an attractive candidate for seroepidemiology studies."
pmc2677401,"respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus  rsv , rhinovirus  rv , and human metapneumovirus  hmpv , are commonly associated with asthma exacerbations. rsv and rv can cause inflammation and airway reactivity through strain differences and the host immune response. hmpv has a smaller amount of viral replication and a low number of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of infected mice due to a decreased type i interferon response, potentially leading to a more successful infection. atypical bacteria, such as mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydophila pneumoniae, are also associated with asthma exacerbations, but the mechanisms leading to these conditions are not fully understood. preexisting allergic inflammation impairs the ability to up-regulate tlr2 and il-6 in the lungs, leading to decreased clearance of m. pneumoniae and an increase in airway inflammation."
pmc6545738,"controllability analysis identifies key regulating host factors of the infected cell's progression during influenza a virus infection. virus interacting and driver host proteins are significant both topologically and in controllability, playing important roles in cell behavior during infection. topological and controllability analyses provide evidence of wide-reaching network effects stemming from the addition of viral-host protein interactions. functional analysis finds overlap with previous sirna studies of host factors involved in influenza replication, nf-kb pathway, and infection relevance, and roles as interferon regulating genes. 24 proteins are identified as holding regulatory roles specific to the infected cell by measures of topology, controllability, and functional role, recommended for further study as potential antiviral drug targets."
pmc2796142,"in the context of instructional design, a key finding is the importance of designing learning experiences that are adaptive and responsive to the needs and preferences of individual learners. this finding is supported by research that shows that such personalized learning approaches can lead to significant improvements in learning outcomes and student engagement  gasevic et al., 2015; kizilcec & schunk, 2014 . in the context of health care, a significant finding is the role of social support in promoting positive health behaviors. a study by christakis & fowler  2009  found that social networks can have a significant impact on health behaviors, with social contagion playing a critical role in the spread of both positive and negative health behaviors. this finding has important implications for the design of interventions to promote health behaviors, as it highlights the importance of targeting social networks and leveraging social support to promote positive health behaviors. in the context of climate change, a crucial finding is the importance of addressing the social and institutional factors that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. this finding is supported by research that shows that mitigating greenhouse gas emissions requires addressing social and institutional factors, such as cultural values, social norms, and institutional arrangements  hulme, 2014 . this finding has important implications for the design of climate change policies, as it highlights the need to address these social and institutional factors to promote effective mitigation strategies. in the context of educational technology, a key finding is the importance of designing learning experiences that are engaging and interactive. this finding is supported by research that shows that interactive learning experiences can lead to significant improvements in learning outcomes, particularly for students who are at risk of academic failure  graesser et al., 2014 . this finding has important implications for the design of learning experiences, as it highlights the need to incorporate interactive and engaging elements to promote effective learning outcomes. in the context of instructional design, a significant finding is the importance of incorporating feedback and reflection into learning experiences. this finding is supported by research that shows that incorporating feedback and reflection into learning experiences can lead to significant improvements in learning outcomes and student engagement  kizilcec & schunk, 2014 . this finding has important implications for the design of learning experiences, as it highlights the need to incorporate"
pmc6421468,"the study reveals that dnmti's, such as aza and dac, induce cell death through the activation of oas-rnase l, which is mediated by the mda5-rig-i/mavs/irf3–irf7-nf-κb signaling pathway. the study demonstrates that basal levels of oas isozymes are sufficient to mediate cell death through rnase l activation, as seen in cancer cells with wild-type p53. the study shows that aza-induced cell death through oas-rnase l is likely to preferentially target cancer cells expressing high levels of oas expression, as observed in many different primary malignant tumors. the study suggests that dnmti treatment of cancer cells with mutant p53 leads to massive dsrna accumulation, which can culminate in a cell-suicidal type i ifn response. the study implies that treatments that increase rnase l activity, such as the inhibition of pde12 or akap7, are predicted to increase the anticancer effects of aza or dac, while inhibitors of rnase l, such as val, are expected to mitigate the cytotoxicity of aza."

pmc5324816,"the study found that llamas and pigs are susceptible to middle east respiratory syndrome  mers  coronavirus infection, shedding infectious virus for up to 4 weeks post-inoculation, although at lower levels than in dromedary camels. the study identified differences in virus susceptibility and pathogenicity between animals of different species, potentially due to distinct tissue distributions of the mers-cov receptor, dpp4, and host factors associated with innate immunity. the study found that horses, unlike llamas and pigs, were not productively infected by the mers-cov strain used in this study, possibly due to differences in the number of goblet cells in the lining epithelium and mucus production covering epithelial surfaces, which may have impeded the binding of the virus to the respiratory epithelium of horses. the study highlighted that members of the family suidae, including common warthogs  phacochoerus africanus , bushpigs  potamochoerus larvatus , and wild boars  sus scrofa scrofa , could be potential reservoirs for mers-cov, as they are commonly found in the greater horn of africa or the middle east, sharing territories and water sources with dromedaries. the study suggested that differences in the number of goblet cells in the lining epithelium and mucus production covering epithelial surfaces could have influenced mers-cov transmission within and among species, as these animals are commonly found in the greater horn of africa or the middle east, sharing territories and water sources with dromedaries."
pmc5733625,"a large outbreak of influenza a h3n2  virus  h3n2v  infection occurred in april-july 2012 in 10 states in the united states, with 306 laboratory-confirmed cases. most patients presented with mild illness and had a history of exposure to swine at agricultural fairs, with direct contact with swine on multiple days preceding illness onset. the majority of hospitalized patients and the single fatality had underlying medical conditions or were young children, highlighting the importance of treatment and prevention strategies for high-risk individuals. the outbreak underscores the need for continued cooperation among animal and public health agencies in surveillance, preparedness, and response activities involving novel influenza a h3n2  virus infections. the outbreak suggests that swine contact at agricultural fairs is a key risk factor for infection, and that direct exposure to swine on multiple occasions may make a considerable contribution to infection with this virus, although limited instances of person-to-person spread were identified."
pmc6314580,"in a study on dengue fever in children in myanmar, the prevalence of g6pd deficiency was lower than in a previous study in the same setting, possibly due to differences in the cut-off level for g6pd activity. the study did not find an association between g6pd deficiency and dengue severity, although some previous studies have suggested that g6pd-deficient individuals may be more susceptible to dengue infection and have higher replication of the virus. the study found that young age is a risk factor significantly associated with severe dengue infection, and that warning signs such as hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, and lethargy were more frequently present in severe dengue patients. the study confirmed that the 2009 who classification for dengue can be applied to detect severe dengue infection in children in myanmar, as patients with severe dengue had significantly higher haematocrit and lower platelet count than those with non-severe dengue. the study proposed activity cut-off points of enzyme activity according to the who classification, as well as the prevalence of g6pd deficient and the predominant genetic mutation among paediatric dengue patients in myanmar."

pmc3655081,"the study found that rhinovirus, previously under-appreciated as a cause of lower respiratory tract infections, was isolated from 25% of enrolled subjects and was a significant contributor to the burden of illness in all age groups, with 60-80% of subjects infected with rhinovirus requiring hospitalization. the study identified coronavirus, most commonly oc43, as a significant contributor to the burden of lower respiratory tract infections, with 14% of all isolates, and 73% of subjects aged 60 years and older requiring hospitalization. the study found that among subjects with mixed infections, the outcomes were not significantly worse than those for subjects with single infections, although more than one virus was isolated in 11.9% of subjects. the study found that among children with lower respiratory tract infections, viral etiologies were determined in only 47%, with a virologic agent being isolated from 20-27% of asymptomatic subjects. the study found that among subjects with mixed infections, the assessment of outcomes lacks statistical power to determine differences between the various combinations of mixed infections, with 62 unique combinations in 125 different subjects."
pmc3270909,"a multivariate analysis of data from a recent study in hong kong found that increased concern about a potential pandemic influenza is a significant determinant of willingness to comply with protective health behaviors, such as vaccination, isolation, and mask wearing. this effect is mediated by a range of factors, including age, education level, and psychological distress. the study also found that younger individuals  ages 16-24 and 25-34  and those with lower levels of formal education are generally less willing to comply with these behaviors. the analysis suggested that the adoption of an alternative, more active approach to risk communication messages may be necessary before a pandemic occurs, in order to prevent societal estrangement and frighten health care workers and responders. the study highlighted the need for tailored communication and support strategies for certain sectors of the population, such as those in widowed households and those with lower levels of willingness to comply. the study also emphasized the importance of considering the limitations of the current study, which is based on hypothetical, anticipated pandemic scenarios and uses dichotomized responses, and has not included less willing individuals. future pandemic planning and modeling should take into account the range of factors that influence overall compliance levels."
pmc3227604,"according to the virtual screening and core hopping methods used in this study, the compound neo6 was found to have a stronger binding affinity with the protein ha1 than the compound zinc01602230. the binding affinity of neo6 with ha1 was also found to be more stable and have fewer dynamic fluctuations compared to the binding of zinc01602230 with ha1. the molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the compound neo6 has a higher flexibility and conformational changes in its binding pocket with ha1 compared to the compound zinc01602230. this suggests that neo6 may have more potential for further modification to enhance its binding affinity and biological activity. the docking simulations showed that the compound neo6 has more favorable h-bond interactions with key residues, such as arg227 and asp92, in its binding pocket with ha1 than zinc01602230. these interactions contribute significantly to the binding affinity and stability of the compound neo6 with ha1. the molecular dynamics simulations also revealed that the compound neo6 has more dynamic fluctuations in its binding pocket with ha1 compared to zinc01602230. however, the simulations also indicated that the compound neo6 has fewer dynamic fluctuations and higher stability in its binding pocket with ha1 than the compound zinc01602230. the molecular dynamics simulations further suggested that the compound neo6 has a higher flexibility and conformational changes in its binding pocket with ha1, which may provide more opportunities for further modifications to enhance its binding affinity and biological activity compared to zinc01602230. this finding provides a promising direction for further drug development against influenza viruses using the compound neo6."
pmc2882628,"treatment of cotton rats with poly iclc, a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded rna, causes an influenza-like illness characterized by increased pulmonary inflammation. the ifn response to infection, both type i and ii, plays a dual role in viral pathogenesis, initiating an antiviral state in the lung but also promoting a tightly regulated proinflammatory state. the particulars of toll-like receptor  tlr  expression changes in treated cotton rats, such as up-regulation of tlr1, 2, and 3 mrna and down-regulation of tlr5 mrna, strikingly resemble changes induced by influenza infection and ifn stimulation of human macrophages and epithelial cells. poly iclc-induced changes in lung tlr expression likely reflect inducible mrna expression in respiratory epithelial and resident inflammatory cells, as well as an increase in pulmonary cellular infiltrate  neutrophils, like macrophages, express a wide range of tlr molecules . increased expression of chemokines regulating neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage recruitment and activation in rsv-infected, poly iclc-treated animals leads to a significant increase in neutrophil and macrophage presence in the airways of rsv-infected animals after poly iclc treatment, contributing to increased neutrophil presence in the airways of rsv-infected animals after poly iclc treatment and overall increase in pulmonary pathology of rsv infection."
pmc6466352,"a dromedary camel vaccine against mers-cov has been developed and tested in camels and alpaca, with complete protection from viral shedding observed in both species following vaccination. vaccination in camels resulted in reduced but not complete absence of virus shedding, with virus replication largely confined to the nasal turbinates. variable neutralizing responses after mers-cov vaccination have been observed in camels, with one animal in a group of three failing to respond to vaccination at all. the response to vaccination in camels varies widely, with one animal in a group of three failing to mount a detectable neutralizing response after vaccination with a dna vaccine expressing full-length spike protein. vaccine development efforts should focus on vaccine platforms that uniformly induce immunity in camels, and in-depth studies to determine the correlates of protection in camels would aid the development of better-targeted vaccines, especially the correlation of levels of neutralizing antibodies in the serum vs. protection against mers-cov in the upper respiratory tract."

pmc4401448,"this study identified four possible serotypes of caastv circulating in dogs in the uk alone, raising questions about their possible origins. the high rate of evolution observed in all astroviruses, facilitated by the introduction of point mutations and recombination events, suggests that some caastv strains may be more pathogenic than others, as previously reported for astroviruses of mink. the study revealed significant genetic diversity within the caastv strains, with the first full-length sequences of two caastv isolates determined. full genome sequencing revealed that the uk strains each grouped with a different caastv isolate from either china or italy, unlike the grouping of all chinese strains. the study found a clear relationship between the presence of caastv rna in stool samples and the presence of clinical signs of gastroenteritis, confirming previous findings from italy and china. however, the study also found co-infections with other gastroenteric pathogens, such as cpv in dogs 1 and 4, which can confound pathology identification in a clinical setting. the study identified a high rate of evolution observed in all astroviruses, facilitated by the introduction of point mutations and recombination events. the study suggests that some caastv strains may be more pathogenic than others, as previously reported for astroviruses of mink, and raises concerns about future disease control, as the presence of multiple strains will make vaccine design challenging. the study found that the prevalence of caastv in gastroenteritis cases in this study was unexpectedly high given that caastv has not previously been reported in the uk. the majority of previous caastv epidemiological studies have focused on young animals, whereas this study included dogs of any age, highlighting the need to have an index of suspicion for infectious causes of gastroenteritis in dogs of any age."

pmc6237255,"the study compared the efficacy of commercially available vaccines used in a heterologous prime-boost protocol of immunization under field-like conditions, including a challenge of immunity, in domestic animals. the study found that the inactivated immunogen engendered better clinical immunity, including relevant anamnestic antibody responses, subsequent to virulent challenge with brsv, compared to a representative, commonly used parenteral combination viral mlv vaccine. the study demonstrated that boosting of already primed  secondary  responses by parenteral mlv vaccines used at a time when commonly administered in the field, at approximately 2 months of age, can also be partially blocked by residual maternal antibodies in calves with good passive transfer. the study suggested that inhibition or blocking of primary antibody responses by maternal antibodies is a well-documented phenomenon of neonatal immunology and is a major consideration for vaccine choice and administration to young animals. the study highlighted the need for more comparative information regarding the boosting of neonatally primed responses, which have a relatively short duration of immunity, when representative, commonly used parenteral combination viral mlv and inactivated vaccines are administered as boosters at the traditional time of handling of calves for a first vaccination, around 2 months of age in a commercial beef operation, overall."
pmc19627,"the authors successfully constructed a full-length arterivirus cdna clone, peav030, and demonstrated its infectivity using several biological and biochemical assays. the stability of the 15.6-kb construct, based on puc18, was not affected by the insertion of the cat gene at two different positions. the authors generated and passedaged eav030h virus containing a genetic marker mutation to facilitate the future development and exploitation of peav030 as an expression vector. high cat levels were detected in cells transfected with eavcat2 and eavcat7 rna, indicating promising results for the development of a peav030-based expression system. the authors detected an interesting defect in the eav030f construct, which appeared to be a complete block of structural protein expression. the absence of cytopathic effect  cpe  or plaques after a 4-day incubation suggests a complete inhibition of structural protein expression. the authors identified a complete inhibition of subgenomic mrna transcription in the eav030f construct, suggesting a complete block of structural protein expression. a trace of rna7 rt-pcr product was detected in the eav030f sample, but it was considered to be an artefact of the rt or pcr procedure. the authors detected the apparently complete inhibition of subgenomic mrna transcription in the eav030f construct, which may be explained as an artefact of the rt or pcr procedure, or may be due to the resulting replicase point mutation. residue ser-2429 is conserved in the three available arterivirus replicase sequences, and it is located between two well-conserved domains in the nidovirus replicase. the authors are currently investigating the properties of the ser-2429 → pro mutant."
pmc6398926,"the study developed two multiplex pcr  mpcr  methods for the detection of canine respiratory viruses  crv  and enteric viruses  cev  in dogs. these methods are efficient, sensitive, specific, and low-cost, and can be initiated by simply adding enzyme, ddh2o, premixed primers, and template. the methods were tested on clinical samples from 20 nasal swabs and 20 anal swabs collected from dogs with symptoms of respiratory disease or enteric disease. the ratio of positive samples to total samples was 80%  16/20  for crv detection and 85%  17/20  for cev detection, indicating good sensitivity and specificity. the study found that canine infectious diseases mainly include respiratory and intestinal viral diseases, including crv  cav-2, cdv, civ, and cpv  and cev  cav-2, caninecv, ccov, and cpv . the study suggests that other pathogenic bacteria are often present along with viruses in canine infections and should also be monitored in future. for example, canine reovirus, bordetella bronchiseptica, and pseudorabies virus are pathogens causing serious zoonotic diseases that should be included in future mpcr detection methods. the study also found that the live vaccine strains used may have an unavoidable impact on disease detection using the methods developed in this study, and discriminating between wild-type infections and vaccines is important. therefore, future research should aim to develop broad-spectrum and accurate mpcr detection methods that can differentiate between wild-type infections and vaccines."
pmc552331,"australia's health relations with other nations are significant due to their domestic and international ramifications, including membership in global and regional bodies, action to counter external threats, assistance to developing countries, and trade and investment in health-related goods and services. in 2003, there were continuing developments in all these areas, including the signing of the framework convention on tobacco control and the finalization of treaty arrangements establishing both a joint standards code and a joint statutory authority, food standards australia new zealand. health was declared a quarantinable disease under the quarantine act 1908 during the sars outbreak, and policy guidelines were developed for health professionals, airport and border control staff, and the general public. health-related international development assistance received little prominence in the official foreign aid program, with security, good governance, and counter-terrorism being emphasized as priorities. the global market for skilled health workers has led to the recruitment of nurses, dentists, and medical practitioners from overseas, contributing to the staffing of hospitals and community health services in australia and other countries. however, this policy raises concerns about the potential for a ""brain drain"" of medical staff from developing nations, and the need for legislation at the state level to regularize the status of some professions."
pmc5691623,"the study identified a novel class of small molecules, bh3 inhibitors, that selectively induce apoptosis in virus-infected cells without affecting non-infected cells. these molecules, including abt-263, facilitate apoptosis in virus-infected cells at physiologically relevant concentrations, without causing toxicity to non-infected cells. the study showed that abt-263, abt-737, abt-199, wehi-539, a-1331852, and a-1155463 specifically induced apoptosis in iav-infected cells, and only abt-263, abt-737, a-1331852, and a-1155463 limited viral replication. the study demonstrated that abt-263-sensitized apoptosis was dependent on the load of viral nucleic acids, and abt-263 treatment could prematurely terminate viral replication, either during the early stages of a viral infection if the viral load was high, or during the late stages of a viral infection if the initial concentration of viral nucleic acid was low. the study suggested that a-1155463, or its derivatives, may be a lead pro-apoptotic compound with antiviral properties, as it caused reversible thrombocytopenia, which made it a suitable antiviral lead candidate. however, its antiviral efficacy should be evaluated in vivo, and its side effects, including its immuno- and neuro-modulatory properties, should be studied in detail."
pmc4445801,"mmtv, a betaretrovirus that infects rodent cells, can also infect human cells less efficiently than murine cells. repeated passaging in human cells leads to the emergence of variants with increased infectivity. sequence analysis reveals that several regions within the viral genome are under strong positive selection pressure during viral replication in human cells, indicating adaptation to the human host. mutations in the env gene, encoding the receptor binding site, are responsible for the increased infectivity of the variants in human cells. a single amino acid substitution, g42e, has been identified and shown to enhance viral binding and infectivity. human tfr1, the cellular receptor for mmtv, is dispensable for infection, and another cell surface molecule mediates viral entry into human cells. these findings explain the mechanism by which mmtv can form host-range variants in non-murine cells and shed light on how viruses gain the capability to infect new hosts."
pmc5954244,"in both the community and hospital settings, children with human coronavirus  hcov  infections were mostly 5 years of age and younger, with nonmedically attended illnesses. among hospitalized children with hcov detections, a significant number received respiratory support and/or were admitted to the intensive care unit  icu , and this was the same for children without coinfection. children less than 2 years of age and those with chronic complex conditions  cccs  were at risk of increased severity of illness. clinical manifestations and severity of illness were similar among the four hcov types studied. the study demonstrated that coronaviruses were detected in a significant proportion of children in both community and hospital settings and could be a contributor to clinically significant respiratory illnesses."
pmc4129158,"the study identified that approximately 63% of all lymphocytes in naive marmoset blood are t cells, with b cells being less prevalent at a ratio of 2 3 b to t cells. this is consistent with previously reported data in marmosets and humans, although one study found a higher proportion of cd8+ t cells in marmosets compared to humans. the study found that neutrophils, which play a pivotal role in the innate response to infection, comprise approximately 3% of leukocytes in naive marmosets. this is lower than the proportion found in mice but similar to the proportion found in humans. the study demonstrated that marmosets can be used to model acute bacterial infections and that the immune response can be characterized in terms of the phenotype and activation status of all major immune cells and key cytokine and chemokine expression. this can aid in identifying correlates of infection or protection in medical countermeasures assessment studies. the study found that, in response to acute bacterial infection, there is extensive activation of all major immune cells, with differences in the activation status of parent cell types explored. this was observed in both the pneumonic and systemic forms of disease, with the spleen being more actively involved in systemic disease, indicating that the disease develops a pneumonic element regardless of initial route of infection. the study found that, in response to acute bacterial infection, all major immune cells expressed high levels of key cytokines and chemokines, with the exception of rantes. this was expected, as the animals had succumbed to terminal disease."
pmc6386816,"in a study of 57 adults who received umbilical cord blood transplantation  ucbt  for hematologic malignancies, viral infections were the most frequent pathogens observed, with cytomegalovirus  cmv  reactivation being the second most frequent pathogen. cmv reactivation was not associated with atg use, but only 3 patients had received this agent. despite appropriate antiviral prophylaxis, fatal herpesvirus infections remained high after ucbt, with 8 episodes of herpes simplex virus  hsv  reactivation, 2 of which were severe and led to patient death. acyclovir resistance was confirmed in 1 patient who died of disseminated hsv-1 infection. bacterial infections were common throughout all time periods, and many were likely related to the presence of indwelling catheters. infections with enterobacteriaceae and vre within the first 30 days after ucbt were associated with increased mortality. the prolonged time to neutrophil engraftment after ucbt increases the period at which recipients are at high risk of life-threatening bacterial infections. delayed neutrophil engraftment is associated with increased mortality. the high burden of disease early after ucbt underscores the need for aggressive surveillance for fungal infections and mold-active azole prophylaxis. invasive aspergillosis was a major cause of death in the study population, but invasive candida infections were rare. none of the 4 patients in the study cohort who died of invasive aspergillosis was receiving prophylaxis with a mold-active azole."
pmc3122807,"the authors developed a sensitive assay utilizing pyrosequencing technology for the detection of individual and mixed variants at position 222 in ha of the ph1n1 2009 influenza virus. the authors showed that the new approach, using a customized nucleotide dispensation order, is more informative than the traditional sanger sequencing method and the pyrosequencing with the cyclic nucleotide dispensation order. the authors demonstrated that the customized dispensation order approach allows the circumvention of the time-consuming and costly cloning of rt-pcr products from specimens containing virus variants. the authors showed that the new approach can be useful in identifying the presence of multiple variants within influenza viruses and other pathogens. the authors demonstrated that the quantitative nature of pyrosequencing allowed the calculation of virus variant proportions with the use of the peak heights within a pyrogram generated using the customized dispensation order."
pmc3230854,"viral control at the level of eif2 is not limited to the phosphorylation of eif2α by pkr, as activation or inhibition of this factor by other members of the same family of eif2α kinases can also occur under specific stress conditions. the formation of stress granules  sgs  is part of the cellular response to stress generated by viral infection, and it is induced by different alterations related to the initiation step of cellular protein synthesis, such as phosphorylation of eif2α or alterations of expression level or function of translational initiation factors, specifically those involved in the initiation phase, such as eif4a, eif4b, eif4h, or poly a-binding protein  pabp , or by preventing the formation of the eif2-gtp-met-trnaictc by inhibiting the met-trnaic association. sgs are not permanent structures, but they disassemble when the cell recovers from a sublethal stress, and consequently protein synthesis is restored. the mechanism of sg disassembly is poorly understood, but proteins such as staufen-1, which binds to dsrna, and microtubules have been described as being important to sg disassembly. because each virus undergoes a particular replicative cycle, the impact of sg formation is different for each virus, and the viruses could modulate the assembly, composition, or disassembly of sgs according to the replicative cycle. viruses that interfere with the assembly of sgs in the case of cells infected with west nile virus  wnv  or dengue virus  dv  hijack cellular antiviral response effector proteins such as tia-1 and tiar and use them in the viral replication complexes, which confers cellular resistance to sg formation induced by stressors such as sodium arsenite. viral control at the level of eif2 is not limited to the phosphorylation of eif2α by pkr, as activation or inhibition of this factor by other members of the same family of eif2α kinases can also occur under specific stress"
pmc2866594,"in the aftermath of world war ii, the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration  unrra  was established to provide assistance to displaced persons  dps  in europe. unrra's focus on dps was driven by the recognition that many people were displaced from their homes as a result of the war, and that they required assistance to rebuild their lives. unrra's efforts to address the health needs of dps led to the development of a comprehensive program that included measures to prevent and control epidemics, such as vaccination, water and sanitation, and vector control. unrra's program was successful in reducing the incidence of epidemics among dps. in some unrra camps, compulsory examinations for venereal diseases  vd  were conducted among female dps. unrra officials, including camp doctors and medical officers, expressed concerns about the necessity, legality, and morality of these examinations, as they believed that the incidence of vd among female dps was already low. they also believed that these examinations were discriminatory against female dps. unrra officials at both the central and regional levels refused to comply with military government instructions to conduct vd examinations among dps, as they believed that these examinations were unnecessary and discriminatory. however, some camps complied with these measures voluntarily, as they believed that dps were indeed at risk for vd. unrra's efforts to address the health needs of dps also contributed to the emancipation of dps from national restrictions, as unrra recognized dps as subjects of an international community. this recognition helped to mitigate the challenges of respecting or transcending national sovereignty in the context of global health threats. unrra's humanitarian motives in the fight against global health threats were more fruitful to international organizations than purely utilitarian rhetoric."
pmc546574,"the study found that the lack of transcriptional activity observed for the canonical cs-s2 in the tgev coronavirus genome was due to the relatively low potential base-pairing scores between the cs-s2 and ctrs-b. this suggests that complementarity between trs-l and ctrs-b during sgmrna synthesis is restricted to a limited region, and only a restricted number of nucleotides within the trs are relevant for the transcription complex. the study also found that mutants increasing complementarity with trs-l by the 3′ trs synthesize larger amounts of mrna-s2 than 5′ trs mutants. this is most consistent with a model of sequence similarity-assisted, polymerase copy choice strand switching during minus-strand synthesis, where the cs within the trs acts as a dissociation signal from the genomic rna template in order to stimulate a strand transfer to the leader region, providing that duplex formation between trs-l and ctrs-b has reached a minimum δg. the study confirmed that complementarity between trs-l and ctrs-b has been confirmed as a crucial regulating factor in the transcription process. the study also found that the relative order of body trss in the viral genome may also determine the relative amounts of sgmrnas, and most probably viral and host components involved in protein-rna and protein-protein recognition will also be decisive in transcription. the study showed that there is a correlation between δg values and the amount of mrna-s2, where for similar δg values, mutants extending complementarity with trs-l at the 3′ trs synthesize larger amounts of mrna-s2 than 5′ trs mutants. this suggests that sequences downstream of the cs are more decisive in the rdrp choice during minus-strand synthesis."

pmc2773564,"this study reports the identification of seven major clades of the h1n1pdm influenza virus, which have co-circulated globally since april 2009. the clades were detected in at least one asian country and in the us states of wisconsin and new york. the study found no significant differences in age distribution or clinical severity among the clades or any fixed amino acid changes likely to impact fitness. the study revealed that the clades transmitted successfully in humans, as even the smaller clades were isolated from clinical specimens by inoculating samples onto madin-darby canine kidney  mdck  cells grown until 95% confluence, stored at -80°c, and that the viral segment dna was amplified using accuprime taq at 35 cycles. the study employed a bayesian markov chain monte carlo  mcmc  method using a strict molecular clock and a gtr+γ4 model of nucleotide substitution, as determined by modeltest, to infer the evolutionary relationships and timescale for the complete h1n1pdm data set analyzed. the study found that the isolates with the most basal position on the phylogenetic tree, not located within any clade, were used as a basis for comparison to identify amino acid changes. the isolates with the most basal position on the phylogenetic tree, such as a/mexico/4603/2009 h1n1 , were not located within any clade and were used as a basis for comparison."
pmc3713968,"the authors present evidence that mutations at the s1/s2 site in the spike protein of feline coronavirus  fcov  are linked to the development of feline infectious peritonitis  fip  in cats. they found that 10 of 11 cats harboring fcov that subsequently developed fip had mutations at the s1/s2 site, and in most cases, these mutations were unique to individual cats. the authors suggest that mutations in the s1/s2 site lead to a switch in the activating protease for fcov, as the mutations are incompatible with the furin cleavage site, which is typical of fcov in asymptomatic cats. they also found that some mutations negatively affect furin processing, while others enhance it. the authors propose that the mutations in the s1/s2 region affect the heparin sulfate binding site in this region, which is a cell culture adaptation of the virus. however, they suggest that this binding site is unlikely to be relevant to the clinical situation due to the fact that it is a cell culture adaptation of the virus. the authors suggest that the mutations in the s1/s2 region lead to cleavability by monocytic/macrophage-specific proteases, such as pro-protein convertases, cathepsins, or other macrophage-specific proteases. they also suggest that these proteases recognize the hallmark residues remaining or acquired in fcov s1/s2 cleavage site. the authors propose that a shift in the entry pathway to enable virus entry at the cell surface instead of the endosome may simultaneously explain the ability of fcov to infect macrophages and the macrophage resistance of fcov. they also suggest that matrix metalloprotease 9, which was demonstrated to be upregulated in activated monocytes and macrophages during fip, may be involved in this process."
pmc538260,"the study reports the discovery of a new coronavirus, named hcov-nl63, which was identified in pigs in the netherlands. this virus is closely related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus  tgev  and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  pedv , both of which are known to cause diarrhea and vomiting in pigs. the study found that hcov-nl63 shares approximately 86% nucleotide sequence identity with tgev and pedv in the 3' untranslated region  utr  of the viral genome. this suggests a potential common origin for these viruses. the study also identified the complete genome sequence of hcov-nl63, which is deposited in the genbank under accession number nc_005831. the study found that the core sequence of the leader  l  region in the genome of hcov-nl63 is presented in the single-stranded loop of the viral rna in a similar manner as seen in tgev and pedv. the study reports the discovery that the core body  b  region and the 5' untranslated region  utr  of hcov-nl63 share approximately 98% nucleotide sequence identity with tgev and pedv, respectively. this finding further supports the close relationship between hcov-nl63, tgev, and pedv."
pmc4323406,"the authors estimate that around six mers-cov infected individuals will attend the 2014 hajj, based on their planning scenarios. however, as of october 2014, no mers-cov cases were reported among hajj attendees, and only three suspected cases were identified among foreign pilgrims returning to their home countries. the authors suggest that a major outbreak of mers-cov during the hajj is unlikely due to several factors, including the short generation time of mers-cov  around 10 days  and the low probability of secondary infections during the hajj. however, they also acknowledge that super spreading events and viral mutations could lead to significantly more cases than predicted. the authors recommend that careful surveillance and testing will be critical in preparing for and containing any potential mers-cov outbreaks during the hajj, as the type of scenario planning reported in this manuscript is essential to any public health response, and it is essential to continue updating and consulting planning scenarios, so that we are prepared to confront and contain the disease whatever may come. the authors suggest that most hajj pilgrims do not mix with locals or visit locations other than the hajj area, reducing their opportunities to be infected. the authors acknowledge that super spreading events where a single mers-cov infected animal or human causes a large number of cases are possible, and viral mutations that shorten the generation time or lead to more efficient transmission are unlikely but could also cause a significant outbreak if they were to occur."
pmc1075701,"the study identified several antigenic sites in the novel coronavirus, including a highly antigenic loop region between the predicted n and m helices of the spike protein  s2 domain  and a dispersed epitope-rich region in an unknown protein  3a . complementary antibodies to the identified immunodominant site in the s2 domain were present in plasma samples from a significant proportion  82.5%  of convalescent sars patients, and antibodies to this site were effective for virus neutralization. while antibodies to the dispersed epitope-rich region in the 3a protein were present in plasma samples from a significant proportion  40%  of convalescent sars patients, their exact functions remain unknown, but they should positively contribute to neutralization of infected cells and augment immune protection against the pathogen. the study revealed that the short epitope-rich fragment of the spike s2 protein between amino acids 787 and 809 is an important antigenic site through which the human humoral immune system recognizes and interacts with the sars cov. the study found that among the many epitopes determined in the phage panning, very few were located in the viral envelope proteins m and e, and that the only identified immunodominant site was located in the loop region between the predicted n and m helices of the spike protein  s2 domain ."
pmc6835697,"grft is a carbohydrate-targeting antiviral protein that displays potent activity against a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses, including hiv, sars-cov, mers-cov, hcv, hsv, jev, and hpv. grft specifically binds to the glycoproteins on the viral envelope and prevents viral entry into host cells, making it a unique topical antiviral protein. grft has a superior anti-hiv-1 efficacy compared to other antiretroviral drugs, with the ability to completely suppress viral replication in vitro and in vivo. grft has an excellent host toxicity profile, with no observed toxicity in animal studies and in human clinical trials. grft can be synergistically combined with other antiretroviral drugs, such as dapivirine and carrageenan, to further enhance antiviral efficacy and reduce toxicity. grft has been successfully produced in large-scale quantities using fermentation, electrospinning, and nanoparticle drug delivery systems, with a focus on improving solubility, protecting payloads, and enhancing mucosal permeability. grft has been shown to be safe and effective for vaginal use for up to 14 days in healthy women, with potent antiviral activity against hiv, sars-cov, mers-cov, hcv, hsv, jev, and hpv. grft has been shown to have a broad antiviral spectrum, with activity against other enveloped viruses, such as hiv, sars-cov, mers-cov, hcv, hsv, jev, and hpv, as well as against non-enveloped viruses, such as hpv. grft has been shown to have a synergistic interaction with other antiretroviral drugs, such as dapivirine and carrageenan, to further enhance antiviral efficacy and reduce toxicity. grft has been shown to have a potential adverse immunotoxicity issue observed during preclinical animal studies, but favorable outcomes from ongoing phase"
pmc7036499,"high treatment costs accelerate the spread of infectious diseases, making it difficult to control their spread. this is particularly evident in the case of high-cost treatments, where the number of infected people remains high, even after a large number of simulation runs. low treatment costs, on the other hand, make it easier to control the spread of infectious diseases, as evidenced by the fact that the number of infected people falls rapidly, and the epidemic can be controlled in a relatively short period of time. when treatment costs are high, government intervention is critical in controlling the spread of infectious diseases, as shown by the fact that the number of infected people remains high, even after a large number of simulation runs, but drops rapidly with government intervention. the higher the treatment costs, the more important government intervention becomes in controlling the spread of infectious diseases. the study suggests that full government subsidy for infectious diseases under high treatment costs is successful, as shown by the fact that the number of infected people drops rapidly and falls to zero in a relatively short period of time. the study also highlights the importance of government intervention in controlling emerging infectious diseases, as uncertainty in medical expenditures about these diseases is high, and complete reimbursement policies should be established to control them. the study provides theoretical support for controlling big infectious diseases, as it shows that high treatment costs accelerate the spread of infectious diseases and that government intervention becomes more critical as treatment costs increase. the study suggests that predicting infectious diseases using learning and big data may be the subject of future study. the study also notes that without government reimbursement, high treatment costs accelerate the spread of infectious diseases, as evidenced by the fact that the proportion of infected people remains high, even after a large number of simulation runs. the study highlights the importance of government intervention in controlling emerging infectious diseases, as shown by the fact that predicting infectious diseases using learning and big data may yield high treatment expenditures, and complete reimbursement policies should be established to control these diseases."

pmc4235711,"in a study on the pathogenesis of epstein-barr virus  ebv -associated diseases, mice were infected with ebv to reproduce ebv-associated diseases in humanized mice. ebv is implicated in a variety of diseases, including burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  ra . one study reproduced the symptoms of ra in humanized mice, suggesting a search for lesions and symptoms of other autoimmune diseases in ebv-infected humanized mice. the study also found that ebv infection is usually asymptomatic, and symptoms of im appear only after long incubation periods of 3-7 weeks. this makes it extremely difficult to find individuals currently having acute primary ebv infection in a period suitable for analysis of innate immune responses. the study found that critical early steps in ebv infection take place in oropharyngeal epithelial cells and lymphoid tissues just adjacent the epithelium. since no human epithelial cells are present in humanized mice, this suggests that replication in epithelial cells is an essential step in primary ebv infection. the study also found that ebv is transmitted orally via saliva, and oral inoculation of ebv to humanized mice has not been successful. this makes it highly desirable to reproduce this natural route of transmission in humanized mice. another finding was that innate immune responses to ebv can be revealed in humanized mice, although the study did not analyze early events following infection. one study using nod/scid mice with human fetal thymus xenograft focused on innate immune responses to ebv and found a role for ebv-induced cd8+ nkt cells in the suppression of tumorigenesis by ebv-associated hodgkin lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. improving humanized mouse models is also being pursued to overcome various limitations in the current models. engraftment of human cells has been improved by introducing human sirpα trans"
pmc3234549,"the authors present a method for estimating the transmission tree of an epidemic using a combination of genetic, geographical, and temporal data. this method is robust to changes in the number of nucleotides that could mutate, n, in the range from the total number of nucleotides seen to mutate to the total number of nucleotides sampled. the authors find that farms with fewer than 1000 animals, which includes all hobby farms by definition, are less infectious than other types of farms. this is consistent with previous results by bavinck et al.  2011 , who estimated parameters of a distance kernel without genetic information. the authors find a peculiar dichotomous relation between farm size and infectiousness, which might be explained by large farms being detected and culled before a substantial number of animals could get infected, or by a mechanism of spread that is not very sensitive to the amount of infectious particles present in a farm. the authors suggest that constructing intuitively plausible likelihood functions for each of the data types and combining them in a straightforward manner is a natural way to weigh different types of data. this is in contrast to a method suggested by cottam et al.  2013 , who assess data types sequentially and disregard any further information in the likelihoods that were derived from genetic data otherwise. the authors suggest that the method presented in this paper is applicable in a wide range of settings, including epidemics of rapidly mutating pathogens such as viruses, and that techniques such as those presented here coupled with our increasing capacity to build up large  genetic  datasets will allow for the accurate and correct estimation of transmission trees in a variety of settings, increasing our understanding of disease dynamics."

pmc6313922,"the phase i safety trial of autologous cancer vaccines containing advax™ adjuvant in 27 canine patients demonstrated safety and feasibility, with no major adverse events observed. the vaccine was well tolerated by dogs, with minimal side effects, and sedation or general anaesthesia was not required for administration. some anecdotal suggestions of possible efficacy in some subjects were reported by treating clinicians, despite the canine patients presenting in various stages of disease and a variety of tumor types. the results indicated that a more intense weekly vaccination schedule for four doses up front may improve response rates and outcomes. the trial demonstrated safety and proof of concept, achieving positive clinical benefits in some patients, including remission, static disease, and extended survival times in a clinical setting."
pmc4014603,"the study detected haemoproteus parasites in 35% of great frigatebirds sampled on europas islands, with no significant difference between adults and chicks. this prevalence is similar to other studies on frigatebirds, and blood films examinations did not reveal any parasites of any blood stages, suggesting a low parasite load. genetic analyses supported that the detected haemoproteus parasite was closely related to haemoproteus iwa previously detected in frigatebirds in different geographic locations. no significant genetic diversity was observed among the limited number of sequences available in public databases. the study also revealed the absence of haemoproteus in red-footed boobies on europas islands, despite their close interactions with frigatebirds. this finding suggests a potential strict host-vector specificity, which may explain the lack of haemoproteus infection in red-footed boobies. the study identified hippoboscid fly species related to olfersia spinifera in frigatebirds and olfersia aenescens in blue-footed boobies on tromelin island, further supporting the potential strict host-vector specificity. the study also detected a plasmodium parasite in a great frigatebird on europas island, related to plasmodium species identified in a large range of hosts and geographic locations. the complete host and geographic distribution of this parasite in the islands of the western indian ocean remain to be identified."

pmc5172239,"the study reports that the complete genome sequence of the sars-cov isolate bj01 has been annotated and analyzed using gene prediction software and other approaches. the study found that the sars-cov genome, which is over 30 kilobases in length, contains only five well-established structural or non-structural proteins, which is fewer than expected for a virus of this size. the study also identified a hypothetical minus-strand hemagglutinin-esterase  he  protein in the sars-cov genome, although another well-studied virus, hcov-229e, does not contain such a protein. the study suggests that large-scale recombination may have taken place in the sars-cov genome, based on the finding that relics of the he protein have spread to neighboring regions. the study proposes a possible explanation for the phenomenon of core segments  cuaaacgaa  in the sars-cov genome, which are similar to a consensus sequence found in the minus-strand sequence, but further experiments are required to prove these hypotheses. the study found that the sars-cov mrnas are synthesized in amounts reversely related to their sizes, and the n protein is richer than any other proteins in infected cells, which supports a model of transcription called the minus-strand extending transcription model. the study also found that mutations introduced in different places along the genome decrease the transcriptional efficiencies or even eliminate the synthesis of subgenomic mrnas, but some subgenomic mrnas are synthesized with mutated sites performed as markers, and the origin of the fused region can be traced. these findings provide evidence for the minus-strand extending transcription model. the study found that the length threshold for orfs is the same as that applied by marra et al. to isolate tor2, and a unique segment, the leader-mrna junction, should exist upstream to the transcription initiation site, within a distance of 100 nt, except for the r protein."

pmc4141115,"the study identified a total of 1282 proteins in royal jelly, with 284 differentially expressed during hypopharyngeal gland development. of these, 43 were identified for the first time. comparison of samples at different stages of hypopharyngeal gland development showed that the majority of differentially expressed proteins were upregulated in older worker groups, indicating a substantial change in protein expression after 3 days. differentially expressed proteins were identified in all age groups, suggesting that changes in protein expression during hypopharyngeal gland ontogeny are concomitant with different states of worker development. over 10 key high-abundance proteins were involved in signaling pathways related to ribosome function and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. the study demonstrated that hypopharyngeal glands experienced important changes in protein expression during ontogenic development, supporting the secretion of proteins involved in diverse functions beyond its traditional role in royal jelly production."
pmc3223529,"the authors report two cases of patients with h1n1 influenza a virus infection presenting with multifocal pneumonia and severe respiratory failure. the clinical features of these patients, including fever, respiratory failure, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated levels of creatine kinase and liver aminotransferases, are consistent with critical illness due to h1n1 influenza a virus infection. other infectious disorders, such as legionnaires' disease, may mimic h1n1 viral infection, and early and rapid diagnosis of h1n1-related respiratory insufficiency requires rapid screening during a pandemic. clinicians should consider the possibility of legionella infection based on clinical history, x-ray abnormalities, and diagnostic weighted point systems for diagnosing legionnaires' disease in adults. the authors suggest that patients with h1n1 influenza a virus infection should be screened for legionella, which is not currently common practice, as the signs and symptoms of both infections are similar."
pmc3338671,"the study utilized massively parallel pyrosequencing to obtain a global transcriptome analysis of sogatella furcifera-infected brown planthoppers  bp  and their uninfected counterparts. this approach identified 81,854 unigenes larger than 350 bp, and the results were deposited in the sequence read archive  sra  database. the study found that 61.3% of the unigenes had significant similarity with known genes, and 32.1% of the unigenes had similarity with genes from the non-redundant  nr  ncbi database. the study also identified 1,317 differentially expressed genes between viruliferous and non-viruliferous bp samples, which were used for go enrichment analyses. the study used a rigorous algorithm to identify differentially expressed genes between the viruliferous and non-viruliferous bp samples, with a false discovery rate  fdr  of less than 0.001 and an absolute value of the log2 ratio greater than 1 providing thresholds for significant differences in gene expression. the study found that genes involved in primary metabolism, ubiquitin-proteasome, cytoskeleton dynamics, and immune responses were upregulated in viruliferous bp. the study used qrt-pcr to verify the results of the pyrosequencing analysis for 42 randomly selected genes and found that the average threshold cycle  ct  was calculated per sample, with an endogenous 18s rrna gene of bp used for normalization."
pmc1563757,"experimental data shows that etm, flanked with two lysine residues, incorporated in model lipid bilayers adopts an α-helical conformation, with a transmembrane topology, i.e., c- and n-termini in opposite sides of the lipid bilayer. this pentameric form could be responsible for the ion channel effects observed in vitro in the full length polypeptide of protein e. the pentameric form we report is unlikely to be an artifact, because these tm interactions and oligomeric size are consistent with evolutionary conservation data and expression of the complete sars-cov e polypeptide, and also consistent with the reported ion channel activity. the ion conductance of this putative channel, using the pore radius profile, is 74 ps, which is remarkably similar to that reported experimentally  80 ps  using a synthetic polypeptide of sars-cov e  9 . the pentameric form of etm, with a transmembrane topology, is unlikely to be an artifact because it is consistent with evolutionary conservation data and expression of the complete sars-cov e polypeptide, and also consistent with the reported ion channel activity."
pmc1431560,"the study found that sivsm, the simian immunodeficiency virus in sooty mangabey macaques, has a high degree of genetic variability, similar to that of hiv-1 in humans. the study identified a high number of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions and synonymous substitutions in both sivsm and hiv-1 env and gag genes, indicating a high mutation rate. the study found that the viral populations in individual animals do not vary randomly through time, and random trees of all variants were generated to determine the number of matching time-point sequences that formed a monophyletic clade. the study compared sivsm env nt sequences from nine patients of a study of 10 hiv-infected patients and found similarities in nt diversity, sequence length variation, and predicted n-linked glycosylation site density. the study found that the viral populations in individual animals do not vary randomly through time, and the number of matching time-point sequences that formed a monophyletic group were counted for each random tree."
pmc6421993,"intradermal electroporation results in rapid induction of apoptotic and necrotic cell death events in the skin, with apoptosis detected as early as one hour after treatment and necrosis peaking at two hours. infiltration of immune cells into the area surrounding the treatment site is observed at four hours after treatment, with peak propidium iodide staining detected at six hours. intradermal electroporation delivery results in upregulation of the phagocyte “eat me” signal of calreticulin in the skin at four hours after treatment. high intradermal electroporation voltages lead to a larger e-field and permit a larger area of tissue to be transfected, but voltages that are too high may cause increased levels of cell death and negatively impact gene expression levels and immune responses. understanding the inflammatory mechanisms induced by intradermal electroporation delivery of gene-based therapeutics will enhance our ability to further tailor electroporation-based delivery protocols to drive the gene expression levels and immune responses desired."
pmc4130269,"yeast-expressed rbd proteins without glycosylation or with deleted or mutated glycosylation sites can still induce strong neutralizing antibody responses and protect animals from sars-cov infection. the yeast-expressed rbd protein without glycosylation at the n1 site, rbd219-n1, exhibited lower glycosylation levels, higher expression yield, and induced stronger rbd-specific antibody responses and more potent neutralizing antibodies against both pseudotyped and live sars-cov, making it a promising subunit vaccine candidate against sars-cov in humans. the rbd of sars-cov s-protein contains multiple conformation-dependent epitopes, and a mammalian cell-expressed rbd protein with high glycosylation was highly recognized by conformational anti-rbd mabs, further validating the ability of this deglycosylated protein to maintain antigenicity and functionality. the yeast-expressed rbd219-n1 vaccine candidate induced nt50  50% neutralizing antibody titer  >1,000 of neutralizing antibody titers against the live sars-cov, demonstrating its prospect to efficiently protect immunized animals from an sars-cov challenge. the rbd219-n1 and rbd193-n1 vaccine candidates induced high and low neutralization titers, respectively, and among all the tested yeast-expressed rbds, rbd219-n1 elicited the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies against the live sars-cov, suggesting that removing the glycosylation site at the n1 site may help stabilize the overall structure of rbd219 and lead to high immunization titers."
pmc4217005,"the discovery of a novel type iii interferon, ifnl4, which is poorly secreted and weakly expressed, may explain the strong genetic associations observed between gwas markers within the ifnl gene cluster and hepatitis c  hcv  clearance, while simultaneously raising questions concerning its functional mechanism and full clinical implications. ifnl4 signals through the ifnlr1/il-10r2 receptor complex despite relatively low sequence similarity with ifnl3 in the region which binds to the il-10r2 chain. ifnl4, unlike most ifns, is a poorly secreted protein. ifnl4 impairs hcv clearance by impeding receptor binding of the other members of the ifn-l family either due to differences in structure or secretion. the ifnl4-δg allele, which underwent very strong negative genetic selection with replacement of the ancestral ifnl4-t allele in non-african populations, is associated with lower expression of ifnl4 mrna, which may result in lower hcv clearance rates in individuals who carry ifnl4-δg. however, daa regimens, which target various aspects of the hcv life cycle, promise to markedly increase hcv clearance rates and eliminate the adverse effects associated with ifn-α treatment. ifnl4-δg genotype associations may be relevant for ifn-based treatment for other clinical conditions, similar to the associations that have been observed for the treatment of chronic hcv and chronic hepatitis b  chb . the strong selection pressure against the ifnl4-δg allele in human populations could have resulted from an infectious agent that is now extinct, or ifnl4 plays an important role in contemporary infectious diseases other than hcv and chb. ifnl4-δg genotype associations may be detected through studies based on the ifnl4-δg genotype or through gwas."
pmc5939068,"the study found that the human adenovirus 52  hadv-52  binds to sialic acid-containing glycans on cell surfaces through a previously unrecognized mechanism that employs both direct and transient contacts. the study identified a conserved binding pocket for sialic acid-containing glycans in the hadv-52 fiber knob, which is distinct from the binding pocket for car, another sialic acid-containing glycan recognized by hadv-52. the study found that hadv-52 preferentially binds to sialic acid-containing glycans with a higher degree of polymerization, such as polysia, which are frequently expressed on the cell surfaces of cancer cells and have been associated with poor clinical prognosis. the study found that the binding pocket for polysia in hadv-52 employs both direct and transient contacts, including low-affinity direct contacts and transient electrostatic and polar interactions between residues surrounding the binding pocket and sialic acid residues that are distal to the nonreducing end of the polysia chain. the study suggests that the binding of hadv-52 to polysia-expressing cancer cells could have potential for the development of oncolytic vectors, as the specificity for polysia can be increased further by mutating a lysine residue in the binding pocket to an arginine, which reduces liver tropism and increases binding to polysia-expressing cancer cells."

pmc6200032,"the development of transgenic cyp1a1–ren2 rats has allowed increased control of the study of hypertension due to the ability to induce hypertension through dietary manipulation in a dose-dependent fashion. cyp1a1–ren2 rats maintained on decreased titrated doses of dietary i3c can tolerate prolonged periods of sustained hypertension but without the ill effects reported by others. cyp1a1–ren2 rats have a relatively slow ramping of blood pressure, which is more closely related to the development of hypertension in the clinical setting. the performance  or productivity  of a cyp1a1–ren2 rat colony is comparable to common outbred laboratory rat strains, despite being an inbred transgenic strain. cyp1a1–ren2 rats produced large litters  10 to 16 pups , which is much larger than reported for the background strain for cyp1a1–ren2 rats from both envigo and janvire laboratories."
pmc6549382,"in the cohort of 424 pediatric patients with primary immunodeficiencies  pids  followed prospectively over 15 years in kuwait, viral infections affected more than one-third of the patients, with cytomegalovirus  cmv , adenovirus, and epstein-barr virus  ebv  being the most common culprits in almost half of the cases. the high frequency of cmv infections  >20%  in the cohort can be explained by the fact that most patients have combined immunodeficiencies, which predispose to progressive infection with cmv. patients with pids, particularly those with combined immunodeficiencies, are more susceptible to viral infections compared to other pid categories, with many patients being affected by more than one virus. the study highlights the importance of awareness among healthcare providers about pids and their potential association with severe or recurrent viral infections, as many pids result in poor antibody responses, and serologic testing should be avoided while antigenic detection methods should be used instead. live vaccines, such as oral polio vaccine, should be avoided in certain types of pids, and any infants born into a family with a suspicious history of pid should avoid all live viral and bacterial vaccines until pids is ruled out."
pmc2772540,"the authors present a list of 48 antigens from pseudomonas aeruginosa that are expressed during pulmonary infections and are potential candidates for diagnostics and vaccine development. the authors demonstrate the applicability of a novel method, using nappas, for rapidly and comprehensively testing full-length bacterial omps for their ability to induce a humoral immune response in infected individuals. the authors found responses to most of the previously known antigens, such as exotoxin a, flagellin, and porin f, as well as responses to a considerable list of new p. aeruginosa antigens, including hypothetical proteins. the authors attribute the stronger response of cf patients to the duration of infection, as these patients undergo phases of relative clearance, promoted by antibiotic treatment, during which antibody titers to some pseudomonas aeruginosa antigens decrease significantly. the authors suggest that a multivalent vaccine, using the 12 most frequently detected antigens here, plus several of the others, seems a likely solution, given the multiple strains of p. aeruginosa and the variation in antigen presentation by the pathogen in different infection types."

pmc3930559,"the study demonstrates that an approach integrating passenger flux data with viral genetic data provides a more accurate prediction of global epidemic spread than those which include only one source of information, as the prediction improvement of the combined data over the passenger flux data alone is not very large. the study suggests that the presence of the trunk lineage in mainland china and southeast asia, a dominant signal for the presence of the trunk lineage, is likely to provide immediate risk maps for the transmission of avian influenza viruses  perhaps based on predictors calibrated against h5n1 avian influenza  and target h7n9 surveillance and control efforts. the study suggests that supporting information text describes additional information on the following topics   i  sequence and location data,  ii  incorporating uncertainty in air community assignment,  iii  bayesian statistical analysis of sequence and trait evolution, and  iv  comparing simulated spatial expansion to recorded h1n1 pandemic data. the study indicates that should the virus remain restricted to avian hosts, risk maps for the transmission of avian influenza viruses  perhaps based on predictors calibrated against h5n1 avian influenza  and target h7n9 surveillance and control efforts would help to pinpoint worldwide regions of immediate risk. the study shows that the study's framework is applicable to different infectious diseases and provides new opportunities for explicitly testing how host behavior and ecology shapes the spatial distribution of pathogen genetic diversity. the study highlights that passenger flux data among pairs of locations is symmetric, thus it is possible that the phylogeographic data is capable of capturing asymmetry in the seasonal process of viral spread, which may also be important in explaining the spatial expansion of pandemic h7n9. the study implies that the degree of temporal stochasticity in the source location of seasonal viruses  perhaps based on predictors calibrated against h5n1 avian influenza  may help to target h7n9 surveillance and control efforts in china. the study suggests that the spatial expansion of pandemic h1n1 viruses is most powerfully investigated by incorporating passenger flux data with viral genetic data and that passenger flux data among pairs of locations is symmetric, thus it is possible that the phylogeographic data is capable of"
pmc4047027,"in a study of the local hiv transmission network in san diego, california, it was observed that individuals with high transmission network scores  tns > 0.75  had a significantly greater predicted risk of hiv transmission within their first year of infection than those with lower tns scores. this finding suggests that tns reflects a biologic correlate of transmission risk. the study also found that self-selected early initiation of antiretroviral  art  drug resistance was associated with a cumulative decrease in putative hiv transmission in the network, as compared to delaying art. the study used data from the local hiv transmission network to inform simulations, which demonstrated that targeting individuals with the greatest number of recent sexual partners or sexually transmitted infections  stis  with highly effective prevention intervention strategies, like fully suppressive art, would reduce local hiv transmission more efficiently than with the same prevention intervention targeting individuals with lower numbers of recent sexual partners or stis. the study also found that network connections at baseline predicted future hiv transmission risk, and prevention efforts targeted to these individuals may be a better use of prevention resources than random implementation or targeting individuals with lower numbers of recent sexual partners or stis. the study noted that while the efficiency of hiv transmission per contact may vary by geographic region, more sophisticated methods are being developed to help better associate molecular and epidemiological links, and these results may not be generalizable to other networks. however, with appropriate privacy protection protocols, it is reasonable to consider using hiv transmission network data to develop prevention intervention strategies. the study also highlighted the potential loss of privacy related to disclosure of putative hiv transmission links and noted the limitations in proving direct hiv transmission links. nevertheless, it suggested that awareness of hiv transmission network characteristics could help local public health officials and clinicians to focus hiv-1 screening and prevention education messages for particular groups over time."

pmc4141843,"a novel canine circovirus, designated as dog circovirus  dogcv , has been discovered in a dog with symptoms of enteritis in italy. long-term storage at low temperatures hindered histopathological analysis, but the virus was successfully isolated from the dog's tissue using real-time polymerase chain reaction. the dogcv genome, similar to those of other animal circoviruses, contains two intergenic noncoding regions and a conserved nucleotide stretch. phylogenetic analysis suggests that dogcv is closely related to other canine circoviruses and less related to porcine circovirus 2  pcv-2 , which has been associated with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in swine. the discovery of dogcv extends the geographical distribution of circoviruses to the european continent. the virus has been detected in a dog with symptoms of enteritis, suggesting a possible association between dogcv and canine enteritis. however, further studies are needed to assess the pathogenic and epidemiological features of this novel canine agent. the full-length genome of the prototype strain, designated as dogcv strain bari/411-13, was determined, revealing close genetic relatedness to the american viruses. the virus isolation attempts using different canine cell lines were unsuccessful, although the cycle threshold  ct  values obtained in real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification were suggestive of high viral titers in the inocula. the data gathered in this study suggest that dogcv has been circulating in dogs for at least 5 years before being discovered. the viral genome contains 36 amino acid substitutions in the replicase and 6 substitutions that are unique to the italian circovirus, compared with other dog circoviruses. the capsid protein, 270 amino acids in length, contains a 30-amino acid-rich region in arginine residues, as observed in other circoviruses. the discovery of dogcv highlights the need for further studies to clarify better the pathogenic potential of this novel canine agent. although the virus is closely related to other canine circoviruses, its pathogenic and epidemiological features remain unclear. the possible"

pmc4615419,"the study demonstrated that pervs, which are retroviruses capable of infecting humans, exist not only in pig tissues but also actively replicate in them. the rt activity, which is a highly sensitive and specific marker for all perv types, was detected in the sera, muscle cell-free supernatants, and liver cell-free supernatants of both chinese experimental mini-pigs and domestic pig breeds. the rt activities from the four domestic pig breeds were higher than that of the chinese experimental mini-pigs in both the muscle cell-free supernatants and liver cell-free supernatants, indicating that pervs exist not only in chinese experimental mini-pigs but also actively replicate in them. the study did not find any evidence of infection with pervs in the patients' sera soon after treatment or within 1 month of follow-up, despite the fact that the human immune system can clear perv particles effectively through various specific and non-specific mechanisms. the ability to monitor clinical trials closely using these assays will be of great benefit to the microbiological safety of clinical blass and xenotransplantation, as it allows for the close monitoring of clinical blass and xenotransplantation trials and sets a possible standard for laboratory surveillance of perv infection after exposure to cellular xenografts from pigs."
pmc3946006,"the study presented a statistical framework to estimate the basic reproductive number, r0, of spillover infections, such as avian influenza, from case incidence data alone. the method was tested using real data from the 2013 avian influenza a h7n9  outbreak in china and was found to be reliable even when under-reporting of cases occurred. the framework allowed for the detection of a signature of human-to-human transmission for a spillover infection from only the time series of overall clinical incidence, without relying on outbreak investigation data. the study estimated that around 13% of observed cases in the three largest clusters of avian influenza a h7n9  in china in 2013 resulted from human-to-human transmission, rather than from spillover exposure. the approach permitted accurate estimates of r0 from relatively small outbreaks and illustrated how being able to characterize the variation in spillover hazard over time could allow for the detection of fitness increases in the virus prior to the virus crossing the critical threshold of r0 equal to one."

pmc3768834,"the study found that feline calicivirus  fcv  was isolated more frequently than feline herpesvirus type 1  fhv-1  in cats with or without clinical signs in southern brazil. this finding is similar to that reported in studies conducted in european countries and the united kingdom. the study revealed that fhv-1 was isolated more frequently from vaccinated cats, particularly those from breeding catters experiencing an outbreak of respiratory disease. this suggests that vaccination may have contributed to a reduction in the number of cats excreting fhv-1 but did not significantly affect the number of cats excreting fcv. the study also found that fcv was isolated more frequently from adult cats, whereas fhv-1 was primarily isolated from younger animals. this finding is consistent with previous studies conducted in cat populations from various locations. the study demonstrated that both fcv and fhv-1 were more frequently isolated from cats that shared a living space, highlighting the importance of close contact between infected and susceptible animals in the transmission of these viruses. the study also identified cats without clinical signs that were excreting fcv and fhv-1, including those that had previously been vaccinated against these viruses. this finding emphasizes the need for continued research into these important diseases of domesticated cats, as these animals could potentially serve as a source of infection, particularly for kittens."
pmc3538476,"in the section on the comparison of patient- and healthcare worker-collected midturbinate nasal flocked swabs, a significant finding was that both methods had similar overall qualitative results and concordance, with slight differences in cp values due to varying levels of virus present, indicating a potential decrease in exposure to respiratory viruses such as influenza a and b through self-collection. another important finding was that self-collection may provide a more time-efficient testing approach, potentially reducing wait times and decreasing the financial burden on healthcare systems. the study also highlighted the potential advantages of self-collection, such as reduced time spent in healthcare facilities, potentially decreasing influenza-associated hospitalizations and healthcare costs, as well as improved patient protection through better adherence to written instructions and minimization of unintentional exposures to respiratory viruses. the study also suggested that self-collection may be particularly useful in large-scale community-based respiratory virus testing programs, potentially alleviating resource constraints and reducing costs associated with healthcare worker training and supervision. the study also emphasized the importance of considering potential barriers to self-collection, such as low health literacy, limited access to healthcare facilities, and language barriers, and the need for developing appropriate models and strategies tailored to address these barriers."
pmc5338018,"according to the discussion structure presented, a significant relationship was found between city centrality and local transitivity, as well as between centrality and mortality rate during the black death pandemic in medieval networks. cities with high centrality and transitivity were found to have higher rates of mortality due to the higher recurrence of reinfection events, indicating the occurrence of a synergistic effect of multiple infections with different strains. the spatio-temporal autocorrelation in mortality rate was explored by fitting spatially-explicit generalised linear models in each city, allowing cities to be repeatedly infected without recovering from the diseases. this model describes how the plague moved among medieval cities following the trading and pilgrimage network, and the transmission of the diseases was given by the contact network among cities. using a susceptible-infectious-susceptible  sis  epidemic model, the spreading of the black death was simulated along the medieval network, with the epidemic starting from central asian cities, and the probability of infection was found to depend on the number of infected cities contacting with the focal city multiplied by the transmission rate of the disease. the relationship between centrality and mortality rate during the black death pandemic was explored by fitting spatially-explicit generalised linear models in each city, allowing cities to be repeatedly infected without recovering from the diseases. cities with high centrality and transitivity were found to have higher rates of mortality due to the higher recurrence of reinfection events, indicating the occurrence of a synergistic effect of multiple infections with different strains. the spread of the black death was simulated along the medieval network using a susceptible-infectious-susceptible  sis  epidemic model, starting from central asian cities. the probability of infection was found to depend on the number of infected cities contacting with the focal city multiplied by the transmission rate of the disease, ranging from a transmission rate of 0.05  very low infectivity rate  to 0.95  very high infectivity rate . the epidemic was simulated by performing 1000 simulations for each infectivity scenario in each simulation. the black death was started in all simulations from central asian cities."

pmc4347589,"in a study, researchers demonstrated that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  pedv  can become airborne and remain infectious while suspended in the air. this was shown through experiments with 12 infected pigs and 8 swine herds located in oklahoma, usa. pedv was detected in air samples collected from both infected pigs and field sites. the study revealed that pedv genetic material can be transported over long distances, up to 10 miles downwind of infected farms, although infectivity could not be shown in air samples collected under field conditions. the authors speculate that this is likely due to the lower viral concentration in field samples or the inactivation of the virus by temperature, solar light intensity, ultraviolet radiation, or during sample storage. the authors suggest that further research is needed to determine the airborne infectious dose needed to induce pedv infection and the impact of environmental factors such as uv light, relative humidity, and temperature on pedv viability. the study found that pedv can remain infectious while suspended in the air, and infectious pedv particles can be detected in air samples collected both experimentally and under field conditions. pigs inoculated with diluted air samples developed clinical signs and lesions, indicating that air samples contained infectious pedv. the study found that pedv can be transported over long distances, up to 10 miles downwind of infected farms, although infectivity could not be shown in air samples collected under field conditions. the study suggests that further research is needed to determine the airborne infectious dose needed to induce pedv infection and the impact of environmental factors such as uv light, relative humidity, and temperature on pedv viability. the study found that pedv genetic material could be detected in air samples collected from both infected pigs and field sites, with an estimated number of rna copies per m3 of air ranging from 1x106 to 1x109 in experimentally infected pigs and from 4.99x105 to 4.21x103 in field sites. the authors suggest that further research is needed to determine the airborne infectious dose needed to induce pedv infection and the impact of environmental factors such as uv light, relative humidity"
pmc6607996,"the study identified a population of cd8+ t cells that was induced by il-4 and controlled by the cell cycle regulatory protein cdkn2a, which is the first time it was reported to be involved in t cell differentiation. these il-10-producing cd8+ t cells played a protective role in tnbs-induced colitis by suppressing the th1 response and decreasing the level of ifn-γ. the study showed that cd8+ t cells were induced to produce il-10 by il-4 and controlled by the cell cycle regulatory protein cdkn2a, and the effect was restricted to cd8+ t cells but was not identified in cd4+ t cells or apcs. the study demonstrated that il-10-producing cd8+ t cells expressed suppressing molecules  pd-1, ctla-4  and a high level of tc2 cytokines. the study observed that naïve mice treated with il-4 and il-2 had significantly lower levels of il-10 compared to mice treated with il-4 alone or mice treated with il-2 alone, suggesting that il-2 served as the growth and surviving factor in their system."

pmc1317511,"the study identified 13 envelope mutations in aslv-a, a class i envelope-defective virus that encodes a single fusion protein, which displayed enhanced sensitivity to the hr2 peptide inhibitor r99. these mutations were distributed across two distinct regions within the envelope  the n-terminal region of the tm subunit, which is also found in filoviral glycoproteins, and a region between the su/tm cleavage site and the fusion peptide. the study found that for a subset of the mutants, the activation threshold for membrane fusion was lower, as reflected by their in vitro requirements for receptor-mediated triggering. this suggests a potential mechanism by which alternative receptors might trigger these mutants, without requiring a change in the binding affinity for the putative alternative receptors. some enfuvirtide resistance mutations of hiv have also been noted to be more sensitive to neutralization, which may reflect a destabilized native conformation, in which access to neutralizing epitopes is enhanced, or a modification of the conformational changes in envelope, such that the epitopes are exposed for a longer period of time. the study found that for some of the hiv-1 coreceptor-independent mutants, determinants of coreceptor specificity within gp120 involved altered interactions between envelope and receptor s , and these changes appear to be linked to enfuvirtide sensitivity. the experiments described in the study characterize envelope function with single-round infection assays, and it is possible that some or all of the mutations might not be well tolerated in the absence of r99 selection, as viral fitness is decreased for hiv-1 enfuvirtide-selected mutants. however, all of the aslv-a mutant envelopes reported in the study mediated infection of avian qt6 cells with wild-type efficiency, and production of replication-competent aslv-encoding the l62a envelope variant that displays peptide resistance and expanded tropism did not result in rapid reversion to wild-type sequence."
pmc3026312,"in capsid assembly, the use of assembly models has revealed that kinetic effects, rather than simple inhibition, can be highly effective in disrupting viral propagation. weak interactions between protein subunits or glycoprotein complexes minimize production of misassembled spikes, making altering the kinetics, misdirecting the intermediates, or stabilizing an interaction to prevent disassembly all viable options for disrupting a highly evolved set of reactions to achieve the same end goal  reduced virus propagation. the assembly of alphavirus glycoprotein spike complexes is a regulated process that occurs early in assembly. interfering with the assembly of the alphavirus e2–e1 dimer, either through stabilization or destabilization, would severely affect the allosteric regulation by the sensor residues during fusion and, as a result, cell entry would be blocked. the assembly of alphavirus spike complexes requires a specific pe2–e1 dimer early in assembly. activation of viral fusion proteins, such as the class ii fusion proteins, requires a distinct chaperone protein. pe2 acts as an effector of e1 activation at two different times, as a chaperone and by releasing e3 for activation. the viral fusion proteins fill many roles, such as mediating fusion between the viral and host membrane via the fusion protein. for example, in contrast to alphaviruses, immature and mature flaviviruses have radically different structures. the unique properties among class iii fusion proteins, suggestive of allosteric conformational changes, also prevent premature fusion during assembly. both capsid and glycoprotein assembly are carefully orchestrated events requiring activation by known and unidentified effectors. interfering with allosteric responses to effectors and environmental sensors could be equally beneficial in disrupting a highly evolved set of reactions to achieve the same end goal  reduced virus propagation."

pmc2752168,"high-throughput genome sequencing technologies have enabled the rapid identification of genes essential for virulence and survival of pathogens in their host environments. for example, the proteome of a pathogen, including its immunodominant and immunorecessive antigens, can be structurally characterized to reveal mechanisms used by the virus to evade host antibody responses. genome-based approaches have facilitated the identification of vaccine and drug targets, including the prediction of immune responses and the potential for autoimmunity. for example, the availability of the human genome sequence combined with methods for predicting b cell and t cell epitopes will facilitate screening for homology or similarity between target candidates and host peptides. the use of techniques including microarray-based analysis of virus-induced host gene expression has revealed several possible targets for drugs aimed at pathogen targets. for example, the cholesterol-lowering drugs statins have an anti-hiv effect that is believed to be mediated by preventing activation of the host protein rho, which is activated by the hiv envelope protein and required for virus entry to the cell. the ability to predict an individual's response to a vaccine or drug, based on genetic variability, will enable physicians to determine whether a patient is genetically susceptible to a disease, the possible adverse effects of a vaccine or drug, and the appropriate schedule or dose to use. the arrival of genomics has greatly aided in the identification of vaccine and drug targets and in the processes needed to bring a new vaccine or drug to the market. however, the stepwise series of prelicensure clinical trials  phase i, ii, and iii  that are required to document the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a vaccine are still highly time-consuming and costly."

pmc5392044,"in cancer research, a better understanding of cell death mechanisms is crucial for improving drug discovery processes. this is because the correct evaluation of cell death in every experimental setting related to cancer research is a must for understanding therapeutic failure, treatment-related side effects, and even providing susceptibility markers. in the specific field of antisarcoma therapy, the assessment of cell death mechanisms is required to understand chemoresistance and cell death immunogenic potential. several clinical trials that evaluate target therapies in sarcomas regarding apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe are still ongoing. in the innovative concept of immunogenic cell death, the induction of this form of death through nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems may lead to potential therapy in pancreatic cancer. in the assessment of cell death processes, it is essential to possess strong cell death assays to explore the potential role of immunogenic cell death in nanomedicines. studies largely recommend not using a single method, for having both quantitative and qualitative data. in the detection of cell death, the main drawback of apoptosis-specific and necrosis-specific assays is that neither of these assays can provide unequivocal information on the occurrence of one specific cell death modality compared with the other. similarly, a reliable method for the detection of autophagy has not yet been developed. additional clonogenicity and viability assays are necessary so as to correctly assess cell death pathways, as apoptosis often occurs very quickly, whereas necrosis is much slower."

pmc5320600,"the authors present a computational tool called k-pax2 that can identify clusters of influenza virus sequences based on their similarity in amino acid composition. this tool can also detect characteristic amino acid changes that are associated with functional sites, and it can differentiate between clusters based on their age or time of emergence. the authors applied k-pax2 to a large set of influenza a/h3n2 ha sequences, spanning from 1968 to the present day, and they identified 23 core clusters that have evolved through antigenic space. these clusters are related to each other in a manner that supports the conclusion that k-pax2 successfully identifies meaningful phenotypes. the authors also found that clusters often have a distinct set of characteristic amino acid changes, and that sequential changes in core characteristic sites rarely occur in close proximity, even when within the same epitope. this raises the possibility that selection tends to favor alternation across the protein surface, even within a single domain. the authors suggest that k-pax2 can extract evolutionary signals from microbial sequence collections and can provide a critically needed tool to guide studies of protein function and evolution. however, they also caution that like most statistical methods, the model-based clustering can be affected by sampling biases of various kinds. the authors conclude that there is a widening gap between the number of experimentally validated evolutionary mechanisms and the abundance of sequence data, and there is demand for computational tools that can aid in harvesting biologically meaningful signals from data to guide further research."
pmc3722568,"a novel locus associated with variability in plasma vwf levels has been identified through a charge gwas meta-analysis. the locus, clec4m, is a calcium-dependent, mannose-specific carbohydrate domain-containing receptor encoded by a gene on chromosome 19p13. the locus contributes to viral infectivity through endocytosis or presentation to circulating t cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells, depending on the ligand. polymorphisms in clec4m, which is expressed on endothelial cells within the liver sinusoids and lymph nodes, affect vwf binding and internalization. clec4m binds vwf in a glycan-dependent manner, with a 75% decrease in binding and internalization of vwf relative to cells expressing clec4m with 7 vntr alleles. the vntr polymorphism in the neck region of clec4m mediates differences in vwf binding and internalization in vitro. hydrodynamic gene transfer in mice demonstrated that clec4m expression in hepatocytes is associated with a 46% decrease in plasma levels of vwf ag. this finding is consistent with previous reports that showed similar conflicting findings. shear stress mediated by flowing blood will affect vwf conformation, as the clec4m crd is hinged or flexibly linked to the neck region. the clec4m vntr polymorphism mediates differences in vwf binding and internalization in vitro, but whether this influence also contributes to variability in plasma vwf levels is unclear and warrants further investigation."

pmc1367161,"the study found that hcv, a flavivirus that causes hepatitis c, requires a low-ph-inducible step for productive entry into cells, similar to other enveloped viruses. however, unlike other viruses, the study found that hcv is acid resistant, suggesting a common strategy in the viral life cycles of hcv and pestiviruses, which could either be a result of a common evolutionary origin or production of acid-resistant virions as a common strategy in their life cycles. the study found that the hcv glycoproteins are not activated for low-ph-induced entry by receptor binding alone but require interactions beyond binding at 4°c. this suggests that hcv may require interactions that do not occur during binding at 4°c, such as interaction with a coreceptor to stabilize binding and activate the virus for low-ph-induced entry. the study found that treatment with dtt, a reagent that mimics the action of protein disulfide isomerases at the cell surface or within the endocytic pathway, eliminated detectable hcvcc infection, suggesting that disulfide bond reshuffling is not involved in activation of hcv for productive entry. the study found that simple binding of hcvcc to cells at 4°c was not sufficient to activate the virus for low-ph-induced triggered entry at the plasma membrane, suggesting that hcv entry at the plasma membrane is nonproductive for downstream events in the viral life cycle. however, the study also found that low ph could override the bafilomycin block to hcv infection after incubation at 37°c, indicating that hcv can undergo time- and temperature-dependent activation at the cell surface or in forming endosomes. the study found that the hcvcc system has provided clues to the mechanism of hcv entry, which can now be tested directly, and that future experiments will be aimed at gaining a better understanding of the steps leading to productive hcv entry, paying particular attention to interactions between the hcv glycoproteins and specific molecules required for entry."
pmc6795681,"the case report presents a dog with persistent cough and exercise intolerance, which is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans  bo , a small airway disease. bo can lead to chronic cough, wheeze, and dyspnea in humans and dogs, and can progress to pulmonary fibrosis. the dog's clinical signs persisted despite multiple courses of antimicrobials, suggesting a possible contribution from bo. thoracic imaging and histopathology confirmed bo and widespread airway-centered interstitial fibrosis in the dog, suggesting that bo can progress to widespread airway-centered interstitial fibrosis in dogs. the dog's clinical signs and imaging findings are similar to those in children with bo, and supportive criteria for bo in humans include history of infectious pneumonia, airway obstruction, thoracic radiographic and ct compatible features, and exclusion of other chronic lung diseases. the dog's clinical course suggests that bo should be a differential diagnosis for otherwise healthy young dogs developing cirdc pneumonia and respiratory signs persisting despite appropriate antimicrobials and with compatible thoracic imaging or histologic changes."
pmc4614917,"tia proteins are involved in multiple cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, epigenetic modifications, and translation control. in cancer development, loss or downregulation of tia expression has been associated with a more severe phenotype, as it can activate genes involved in neoplastic and malignant transformation, evade the immune system, and enhance the growth and survival of cancer cells. tia proteins act as cellular gatekeepers, as they contribute to cell-cycle arrest and cell death during tia1 or tiar expression. loss or downregulation of tia expression can play a role in cancer progression by activating genes involved in neoplastic and malignant transformation, evading the immune system, and enhancing the growth and survival of cancer cells. tia proteins can be found in different biological situations or pathophysiological conditions, including genotoxic stresses, genomic instability, and cancer development. in cancer patients, mutated tia expression can be used as a biomarker to identify individuals at high risk for metastasis, differentially diagnose early-late cancer, and assess the efficacy of therapy and chemopreventive agents. tia proteins are involved in multiple molecular targets, including transcription, splicing, translation, and epigenetic modifications. they can be found in cells, tissues, and organisms, and their specific environmental settings can be identified. the regulatory message associated with tia proteins is still unknown, but their secrets and potential constantly invite further investigation. future research should elucidate the specific environmental settings under which tia proteins act as cellular gatekeepers, as well as the fraction of tia1 and/or tiar regulatory events and layers that contribute to phenotypic differences relevant for conserved or prevalent changes between cells, tissues, and/or species."
pmc3411038,"retrocyclins, a class of cathelicidin-derived peptides found in humans, rhesus macaques, and baboons, demonstrate potent antimicrobial activity against various bacterial and viral pathogens, including hiv-1, influenza a virus, and staphylococcus aureus. retrocyclins, unlike other antimicrobial peptides, are produced in low amounts in human bone marrow and spleen, but their production can be scaled up for systemic applications. retrocyclins inhibit viral entry by binding to glycoproteins on the surface of viruses, such as gp120 and gp41 in hiv-1 and hemagglutinin in influenza a virus, respectively. retrocyclins also have anti-inflammatory properties, as they inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as il-1β and il-8, in response to bacterial and viral infections. retrocyclins are multivalent lectins that cross-link viral surface glycoproteins, preventing viral entry and enhancing viral clearance by phagocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages."
pmc5523921,"clinical identification, laboratory detection, and public response are the three keys for effective disease detection and control, with laboratory detection being the central piece. in diseases where all elements of this framework are in place, a rapid response can occur, as seen in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome. workforce and laboratory network development are crucial for effective disease detection and control, as highlighted in the africa centres for disease control  cdc  workshop in addis ababa. antimicrobial resistance  amr  is a major concern, and best practices for amr control and surveillance have been implemented in various african regions, including ethiopia, côte d'ivoire, and egypt. the private sector, including non-governmental organizations and private laboratories, can play a significant role in public health in africa, as seen in the case of international clinical laboratory in ethiopia."
pmc2731837,"the willingness of healthcare workers in hong kong to accept pre-pandemic influenza vaccination is low, with a response rate of below 50%. this is consistent with the low acceptance of seasonal influenza vaccination among healthcare workers worldwide, where only 32.9% of healthcare workers in hong kong and 15.6% of healthcare workers in the uk would accept pre-pandemic vaccination during the sars outbreak. the main barriers to vaccination identified in this study are fear of side effects and doubts about the efficacy of the vaccines. a history of seasonal influenza vaccination and perceived likelihood of being infected are also associated with the intention to accept vaccination. the study highlights that efforts to improve the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination by healthcare workers should be a part of pandemic preparedness plans, as disseminating correct information may be more difficult during crises. the study suggests that public health agencies should provide more information to staff, especially to those with higher levels of anxiety and doubt. the study found that younger staff and staff with less than five years of working experience are more willing to accept vaccination. however, this does not necessarily indicate that the experience of the sars outbreak enhanced the willingness to accept the vaccination. the study also found that the uptake rate for seasonal influenza vaccine among elderly people in hong kong varies among the target groups, and more than 90% of elderly people in institutions received influenza vaccine delivered on site. the study suggests that there are common barriers to influenza vaccination that exist across geographical regions and racial groups. the study highlights that campaigns to promote vaccination should consider addressing the knowledge gap of staff and the specific target groups for intervention. the study also suggests that further qualitative studies, such as focus group discussions or semi-structured interviews, should be conducted to consolidate and supplement the findings. the study concludes that a successful vaccination strategy should not only protect the health of healthcare workers but also limit the transmission between the health sector and the community, as a lesson from the sars outbreak."
pmc6462397,"in this study, influenza viruses were the most prevalent respiratory viruses diagnosed among ili cases in thailand. while rsv and hmpv infections were found mainly in young children and sporadically in adults, influenza virus infection was prevalent in adults and the elderly. a small number of individuals had dual infections, most commonly rsv and influenza a h3n2. the prevalence of influenza a h3n2 contrasts with the limited circulation of influenza b during this two-year study period. due to overlapping seasonal occurrence of these viral infections, accurate and rapid molecular detection can potentially assist clinicians and researchers in the treatment and surveillance to limit viral spread."

pmc3808260,"nosocomially acquired co-infection in children hospitalized for bronchiolitis is rare, even when rsv-positive and rsv-negative patients share a room during the first day of admission. co-infection is not associated with more severe disease in children with bronchiolitis. cohorting rsv-infected patients may not be necessary to prevent cross-infection, as the main route of transmission is through direct contact. strict adherence to hygiene measures by medical staff and patient's relatives is crucial in preventing nosocomial infections. routinely performing virological diagnostic testing in children with bronchiolitis may not be necessary, as the diagnosis of bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis and for this purpose further diagnostic testing is not needed."
pmc5792953,"in experimental trials, a clear pathogen invasion threshold was observed in populations of daphnia magna, with no successful pathogen transmission at low host densities and a sudden increase in infection events at high host densities. this threshold was qualitatively similar to predictions from deterministic and stochastic realizations of an epidemiological model, suggesting consistency with both deterministic and stochastic model realizations. however, there were differences between stochastic and deterministic model realizations, and both of these models from the experimental data. predictions for the pathogen invasion threshold, defined as both r0>1 and as the probability of observing a primary infection event, obtained from deterministic and stochastic realizations of the epidemiological model, were qualitatively similar to experimental epidemics. the range of threshold values observed for the wide range of parameter space sampled in the model, including many important parameters related to pathogen transmission, production of infectious spores, and pathogen demography, generated a number of open questions concerning how environmental covariates, species interactions, or genetic factors may influence this critical threshold. evidence that invasion thresholds may shift as a function of environmental context was provided by the range of threshold values observed for the wide range of parameter space sampled in the model, including many important parameters related to pathogen transmission, production of infectious spores, and pathogen demography. this generates a challenge for future research efforts to accurately capture transmission and infection dynamics in natural populations. understanding how environmental covariates, species interactions, or genetic factors may influence this critical threshold is an important research area that may be informed through the use of existing data and the incorporation of stochasticity into invasion threshold estimate parameters. this is provided by the range of threshold values observed for the wide range of parameter space sampled in the model, including many important parameters related to pathogen transmission, production of infectious spores, and pathogen demography. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. funding for the study was provided through the odum school of ecology and the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada."
pmc149593,"the ics-rv assay, a rapid immunomigration test for the detection of human group a rotavirus, was evaluated as a potential diagnostic tool for bovine rotavirus. the sensitivity and specificity of the ics-rv assay were comparable to those of commercially available enzyme immunoassays and rt-pcr for detecting rotavirus in samples from calves with neonatal diarrhea. the ics-rv assay had a high positive predictive value and a relatively high negative predictive value, making it a useful tool for disease control recommendations to producers. the ics-rv assay reliably detected rotavirus shedding during the clinical phase of the disease when orally inoculated colostrum-deprived calves with a reference strain of rotavirus. the ics-rv assay met the requirements for a field test, including being practical and user-friendly, as it was a 10-min one-step test with all necessary reagents included in the kit and no need for laboratory equipment."
pmc5840604,"the 2015 outbreak of mers-cov in the republic of korea was the largest outbreak outside of the middle east. the outbreak unveiled the weak points of infrastructure in korea's medical system, including loose medical referral systems, overcrowding at emergency departments, a lack of expert resources and infection control infrastructure, and a lack of organized preparedness for medical crises. the introspection for these issues prompted the government to reform the healthcare system and healthcare sectors to invest further in infectious diseases and infection control. the first line of defense against emerging infectious diseases should be doctors in community clinics/hospitals due to the single, missed case triggering a huge, nationwide outbreak. patients may transmit mers-cov as early as 2 days after symptom onset, and early detection and isolation are of critical importance, especially when a large number of individuals are exposed in healthcare settings, where superspreading events may occur, especially at emergency departments."

pmc2989958,"the study found that two genetic variants in the promoter region of the dc-sign gene, dc-sign -139 gg and -939 aa, were significantly associated with increased risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma  npc  in a cantonese population. the study also identified two new variants, dc-sign -116 g/t and -190 a/g, although their minor allele frequencies were low  0.6% and 0.3%, respectively . the study revealed that the allelic distribution of dc-sign genes differed widely in populations from different ethnic groups, presumably due to selective pressure exerted by prevalent pathogens in these geographically distinct regions. the study showed that the mutant genotypes dc-sign -139 gg and -939 aa detected in the promoter region of the dc-sign gene were involved in npc susceptibility, and further studies are necessary to demonstrate the role of dc-sign promoter polymorphisms in the function of dc-sign as well as their effect on ebv infection. the study suggests that dc-sign, a protein expressed on the surface of dendritic cells  dcs , may serve as a putative receptor for secretory iga  siga  on immature dcs by binding to high mannose glycoprotein on siga protein, which may promote ebv infection of immature dcs. however, further studies are necessary to confirm this link."
pmc5894362,"the established hs-gc-ms method for testing 1,4-dioxane in plga/tcp porous scaffolds is validated to meet the requirements in the chinese pharmacopoeia 2015 edition, providing a residual 1,4-dioxane test method for plga/tcp scaffolds during cfda registration. the method overcomes the matrix effect in the drying process of scaffolds by using dimethylformamide  dmf  as a solvent for extraction, which eliminates the effect of the porous structure in the scaffolds. the method is used to optimize the drying process of scaffolds to satisfy the product requirement, which is an important tool for quality control of composite scaffolds. the study detects chloroform in some batches of plga raw material from different suppliers, indicating the need for a specifically tuned gc-ms method for each target solvent to meet the requirements of method validation. the study shows that the conditions of −50°c and 50 pa for lyophilizing are not efficient for removing 1,4-dioxane because, in this environment, 1,4-dioxane prefers solid rather than gas."
pmc5542384,"the study provides a temporal description of the patterns of dengue virus spread in asia, revealing that dengue virus genetic diversity in asia is dynamic yet spatially structured, with frequent virus lineage movement among countries and frequent co-circulation of dengue virus lineages. the analysis suggests that the air transportation network has contributed to the spatial dissemination of dengue virus in asia, with large transportation hubs accounting for most of the inferred virus lineage movements within their respective networks. the study suggests that some countries, such as thailand and india, seem to act as central hubs of dengue lineage movement in asia, demonstrating both inward/outward viral migrations with other countries in the region. the study suggests that some countries, such as vietnam and malaysia, may have had an increasing role in dengue spread through time, with differences in the roles of air transport nodes in regional-scale dissemination of dengue virus. the study highlights the importance of developing a multivalent dengue vaccine in order to cope with increasing frequency of dengue serotype co-occurrence, as the potential impacts of vaccination on dengue epidemics in asia should be considered, especially for countries in the tropics."

pmc2889823,"event #6, which occurred in august 2004, had a significant and rapid impact on rabies public health resources in france. this event involved a rabid dog that traveled through southwestern france during its communicable risk period and had contact with humans and animals at three large summer music festivals, each with at least 10,000-20,000 participants. this led to extensive contacts between the rabid dog and humans and animals, potentially exposing a large number of individuals to rabies. the public health authorities in france responded to this event by launching an intensive communication strategy, including identifying and contacting each individual with confirmed contact with the event #6 dog, and forbidding hunting with dogs in the counties where the rabid dog had traveled during its infectious period. this intensive communication strategy led to a passionate public debate, angering hunters and ending with hunting organizations successfully blocking the ban. public health decision-makers have to anticipate the depth and scope of potential consequences of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases and their related press communications, and the need to prepare appropriate responses to keep the public health organization effective. the crisis caused by the event #6 highlighted a lack of experienced manpower and insufficient vaccine stocks, with excessive consulting at armc and durably increased antirabies drug rates for several months, along with more animal diagnostic testing. this crisis also underscored the need for a post-crisis communication strategy to prepare appropriate responses to keep the public health organization effective. the public health authorities in france responded to this event by launching an intensive communication strategy, including identifying and contacting each individual with confirmed contact with the event #6 dog, and forbidding hunting with dogs in the counties where the rabid dog had traveled during its infectious period. this led to a passionate public debate, angering hunters and ending with hunting organizations successfully blocking the ban. this event and its associated national newspaper coverage profoundly perturbed health care services, with excessive consulting at armc and durably increased antirabies drug rates for several months, along with more animal diagnostic testing. this crisis also underscored the need for a post-crisis communication strategy to prepare appropriate responses to keep the public health organization effective. the crisis caused by the event #"
pmc4786625,"in a study investigating the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant protein composed of residues 377-588 of the middle east respiratory syndrome  mers -coronavirus  mers-cov  rbd domain fused to the fc portion of human igg  s377-588-fc , researchers identified several adjuvants that could further improve the immune responses. among these adjuvants, mf59, an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant that activates non-tlr sensing receptors, was found to be superior to other adjuvants, including aluminum and freund's, in enhancing and broadening protection against mers-cov infection, allowing for antigen dose-sparing and increasing seroconversion and cross-reactive antibody titers after vaccination with only two doses. the study revealed that mf59, unlike other adjuvants, has unique characteristics, as it is the first adjuvant licensed for human use after aluminum and is an effective and safe vaccine adjuvant approved in europe for use with influenza vaccines. because of its strong efficacy in potentiating the immunogenicity of influenza virus antigen, mf59 allows for antigen dose-sparing and enhancing cross-reactive antibody titers after vaccination with only two doses, making it less appealing than mf59. the study showed that the mers-cov rbd-based subunit vaccine, when formulated with mf59 adjuvant, induced highly potent specific immune responses, suggesting that mf59 is an ideal adjuvant for mers-cov rbd-based subunit vaccines. this finding provides a foundation for evaluating the adjuvanticity of mf59 in subunit vaccines against influenza viruses and other viruses with class i fusion proteins, such as hiv, sars-cov, ebola virus, and nipah virus. the study also demonstrated that the mf59-adjuvanted mers-cov rbd protein induced highly potent neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov infection, while another adjuvant, mpla-sm, elicited"

pmc22137,"tmv, a nonpathogenic plant virus, was successfully used as a carrier and delivery vector for a protective epitope from mhv, a human pathogen, resulting in the induction of high-titer antibodies and protection against mhv infection in mice. the 5b19 epitope, part of the mhv glycoprotein, was fused to the carboxy-terminus of the coat protein  cp  of tmv, and this chimeric virus was able to elicit a protective immune response against mhv in mice. the high-dose regimen of immunization, consisting of three injections per week for 10 weeks, resulted in high titers of antibodies against both the mhv glycoprotein and the 5b19 epitope, as well as high survival rates in mice challenged with mhv strain jhm. mice that received a low dose of immunogen and had high anti-5b19 igg titers but low anti-5b19 iga titers were not protected against mhv infection, suggesting that igg alone may not be responsible for the protection against mhv infection. the tmv system, with its high yield of immunogen at low cost, may be suitable for oral vaccine development, as it combines the advantages of a nonpathogenic virus and mucosal targeting."
pmc4018855,"the study successfully integrated expression cassettes into the chromosome of lactobacillus casei using a single-plasmid system, eliminating the need for selection requirements and providing genetic stability and conformity with biological safety standards. the study used the pgsa gene product as an anchor for surface display of antigens on l. casei, which was confirmed by laser confocal microscopy, showing green fluorescence on the surface of cells and blue fluorescence in the bodies of cells. the study detected expressed protein from the three newly generated recombinant strains using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  elisa , demonstrating that the alpha-toxin genes of these three strains were expressed and that the expressed protein had biological activity. the study found that the newly generated recombinant strains were genetically stable, as all strains remained genetically stable after 40 generations. the study found that the newly generated recombinant strains grew more slowly than wild-type l. casei, in both mrs and sdm media, which may be related to the insertion of the exogenous gene and the fact that the genome is present as a single copy and multiple copies of a plasmid are present in the cell."
pmc4256287,"the authors identified a novel adenovirus, psittacine adenovirus hku1, in mealy parrots that was most closely related to duck adenovirus a of the atadenovirus genus. this virus was not detected in any of the healthy parrots and other detained animals without c. psittaci infection, suggesting possible synergistic interaction between adenovirus and c. psittaci in disease pathogenesis. a positive correlation between adenovirus viral loads and c. psittaci bacterial loads was observed in lung specimens, suggesting a possible synergistic interaction between adenovirus and c. psittaci in disease pathogenesis. the authors observed active viral replication instead of latent infection of psittacine adenovirus hku1 in lung and liver tissue cells using immunostaining, indicating that this virus may have caused immunosuppression among infected parrots. the authors speculate that the high genomic g+c content of psittacine adenovirus hku1 may determine the tropism of the virus to infect psittacine hosts. the authors suggest that co-infection with psittacine adenovirus hku1 may have been associated with immunosuppression among infected birds, leading to higher c. psittaci bacterial loads in the lungs of psittacine birds and hence increasing the risk of infection in exposed humans."
pmc6066233,"the study constructed a tumor-inducing virus  tvm  to express american cockroach major allergens in chinese cabbage, allowing for the production of a plant-made edible vaccine. oral administration of this vaccine prevented the development of allergen-specific ige production, airway hyperresponsiveness, type 2 cytokine production, and lung inflammation in a murine allergic asthma model. the vaccine consistently provided better effects in terms of inhibition of development of allergen-specific ige production, airway hyperresponsiveness, type 2 cytokine production, and lung inflammation compared to a vaccine encoding full-length allergens. this is the first report to describe the successful use of a tvm viral vector-expressed cockroach allergen given as an oral vaccine to prevent the development of allergic asthma and allergic inflammation later in life following exposure to cockroach allergen in a mouse model. the study suggests that plant-made edible vaccination is a promising strategy for treating allergic airway diseases due to its low cost and potential for mass production. however, further study is required to determine its efficacy in treating pre-existing allergic diseases with the same efficacy as conventional allergen-specific vaccines or sublingual allergen vaccines."
pmc3443020,"overexpression of nsp2, a non-structural protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  prrsv , significantly increases the expression of interleukin-6  il-6 , interleukin-8  il-8 , and cox-2, as well as nuclear factor kappa b  nf-κb  and phosphorylated nf-κb  p-nf-κb  in helena cells, indicating a strong pro-inflammatory effect of prrsv nsp2. the study demonstrates that nsp2 is a potent inducer of pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways in prrsv-infected cells, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of prrsv. the findings suggest that nsp2 plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammatory responses during prrsv infection, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying prrsv pathogenesis. the study also reveals that prrsv nsp2 can significantly increase the expression of il-6, il-8, and cox-2 in helena cells, which may have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of prrsv-associated diseases. the research provides insights into the role of prrsv nsp2 in the regulation of inflammatory responses, which can contribute to the development of strategies for the prevention and management of prrsv-associated diseases."

pmc6238668,"the study identified distinct immune signatures linked to specific viral and bacterial pathogens in symptomatic children, which can help elucidate factors contributing to ari in pediatric patients. the study revealed that interferon-gamma  ifnl3  and its downstream signaling pathway play a protective role in the ongoing antiviral immune response in the nasal mucosa during ari in pediatric patients. the study identified a group of genes at the intersection of the immune response to the presence of microbial loads and clinical symptoms, which may act as markers of the immune response at the nasopharyngeal interface in children with ari. the study found that marco, a scavenger receptor expressed in tissue-resident macrophages, recognizes various bacterial pathogens and can enhance adenovirus infection in children with ari. the study identified a group of immune genes specific to the presence of coinhibitory molecules, which were known to dampen the local immune response during ari in pediatric patients."
pmc2779851,"in the context of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, a survey conducted in the united states found that people's anxiety about swine flu and the preventative actions they took to avoid infection declined as the perceived gravity of the novel outbreak waned. both of these distributions showed a marked bimodality, with a large proportion of respondents indicating a higher subjective risk and more protective actions taken than the majority. the results of the model for the protection index suggest that respondents' deployment of protective behavior is mediated by their subjective anxiety level, controlling for demographic, epidemiological, and geographic variables. in the context of the 1918-19 influenza pandemic, a study of 20,00 people in the united states found that 42% of those who died of influenza were aged 5 to 42, and 54% were aged 10 to 59. the mortality rate was highest in people aged 25 to 34 years, and the mortality rate in people younger than 5 years was less than half the mortality rate in people aged 25 to 34 years. in the context of the ebola outbreak in west africa in 2014-16, a study of 1,411 patients with ebola virus disease found that case fatality was highest in people aged 35-54 years  49.3%  and lowest in people younger than 5 years  22.2%  and aged 15-24 years  29.0% . in the context of the covid-19 pandemic, a study of 1,541 patients hospitalized with covid-19 in wuhan, china, found that 8% were aged 80 years or older, and 1.3% were aged less than 20 years. the in-hospital mortality rate was highest in people aged 80 years or older  28.1%  and lowest in people aged 20-29 years  1.2% . in the context of a study of 6,249 responses to a survey on the 2009 swine flu pandemic in the united states, the results suggest that people with the fewest contacts have marginally higher protection"

pmc4542381,"dsrna species are produced in sufficient amounts in most animal virus infections to be readily detected by routine immunofluorescence antibody staining, except for negative-strand rna viruses, which require the use of tyramide signal amplification. viral countermeasures, such as the expression of dsrna binding proteins, limit or mask dsrna production in some virus infections, resulting in lower levels of detectable dsrna. dsrna is a major viral trigger of the innate immune response but is subject to viral countermeasures, such as the expression of dsrna binding proteins, in some virus infections. dsrna staining is observed in the cytoplasm, frequently in perinuclear locations, and is found in areas where viral factories are formed in most virus infections studied here and those described in the literature. dsrna antibodies should have a role in viral discovery using next-generation sequencing because of the exclusion of ssrna in host tissues, as viral sequences comprise only a tiny fraction of a massive, complex, and largely irrelevant host rna data set in chronic viral infections where the nucleic acid of a virus may be present in ultralow abundance compared to the levels in acute infections."
pmc4807156,"in a study by xu et al., it was found that the ligand cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate  cgmp  up-regulates epithelial sodium channel  enac  activity via two mechanisms  release of self-inhibition externally and activation through cgmp/cyclic guanosine kinase iii  cgkiii  pathway intracellularly. enac mutants with the mutations γc33a, γc41a, or γc33a/c41a have significantly enhanced sodium self-inhibition and reduced open probability compared with wild-type enacs, suggesting that enac palmitoylation is an important post-translational mechanism of channel regulation. pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, a monogenic disorder of mineralocorticoid resistance characterized by salt-wasting, hyperkalemia, high aldosterone levels, and failure to thrive, is caused by mutations in enac, and is associated with severe and persisting multiorgan symptoms. the relief of self-inhibition by cgmp contributes to the acute effects, in addition to the well-known camp-pka signal pathway, and cgmp increased in murine and rat lungs both in vivo and in vitro following no application. enac is involved in edema formation and kidney disorders, and compounds such as specific p2y12 receptor activators and/or self-inhibition inhibitors could be the basis for novel pharmaceutical interventions for combating diseases associated with impaired enac function."

pmc3589936,"this study developed a model for screening agonists of the human tlr5-mediated nf-κb pathway using a human tlr5 cell model, which is more suitable for human therapeutic application than previous models used in other studies. the study found that branched polyethylenimine  pei , a chemical compound with a molecular weight of ∼25 kda, can activate the human tlr5-mediated nf-κb signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner in this cell model. the study demonstrated that pei has a significant protective effect against radiation injury in an animal model, as it prevented animal weight loss caused by γ-ray irradiation, significantly increased animal body weight over a period of 30 days, and improved animal quality of life, prolonged animal survival time, and reduced mortality. the study found that pei provides advantages over flagellin protein, such as higher pharmacological specificity, requires a lower dose to achieve the same effect, is easier to deliver to its targets, and is stable in storage at room temperature. the study suggests that pei, like flagellin protein, offers radiation protection, including, but not limited to, protecting cancer patients who receive radiotherapy or radiosurgery, and could serve as a new compound for protecting the health and safety of people in radiation-related accidents."
pmc2665673,"in the context of multiple sclerosis, studies have linked the disease to exposure to certain microorganisms, particularly environmental factors, which can influence disease development through a cumulative lifetime exposure. the amount of epidemiological evidence reporting a strong association between multiple sclerosis and infection with specific pathogens, such as herpesvirus type 6, adenovirus, and human papillomavirus, is stronger for certain diseases than for others, such as lyme disease, where the evidence for a role for a particular pathogen is weak. in the context of multiple sclerosis, the major infectious models in mice, such as theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus  tmev  and mouse hepatitis virus  mhv , cause a single major symptomatic episode, followed by clearance of the virus, although the virus persists in low amounts. in contrast, in the context of multiple sclerosis, tmev-induced demyelinating disease is caused by epitope spreading from viral determinants to self-myelin determinants. in the context of multiple sclerosis, chemokine receptor knock-out mice virtually abolished lesions of demyelination, whereas depletion of cd8+ t cells did not have that effect. other studies in balb/c mice have shown that th1-type cytokines are involved in viral clearance but not demyelination. in the context of guillain-barré syndrome, in mice inoculated with neurotropic strains of semliki forest virus  sfv , lesions of demyelination are not seen in nude or scid mice, demonstrating that it is t cell-mediated. in the context of guillain-barré syndrome, computer algorithms uncovered homology between an epitope in the sfv surface protein e2 and myelin oligodendrocyte protein  mog 18-32. mice primed with either peptide develop paralytic symptoms with histopathology resembling that of mice infected with sfv. the authors of that study concluded that the cross-reactive antibody response was mainly responsible for the demyelinating lesions."

pmc5941998,"the randomized clinical trial involved 200 children and adolescents with sickle cell disease who received either a monthly dose of 12,000 international units  iu  or 100,000 iu of oral vitamin d3. both monthly standard- and high-dose vitamin d supplements raised 25-hydroxylated vitamin d  25-ohd  concentrations to sufficient levels, but only in the group receiving the high dose was the concentration consistently above the threshold for skeletal health. the annual rates of respiratory events, including respiratory infections, asthma exacerbations, and acute chest syndromes, decreased by >50% during year 2 of treatment in both the standard- and high-dose treatment groups, with similar magnitudes of reduction. monthly standard- and high-dose vitamin d supplements were safe, with no significant differences in adverse events between the two groups. the trial results provide evidence for a substantial protective effect of vitamin d against sickle cell respiratory complications that was manifest only after a year of bolus administration, but daily administration would produce sustained increases in the concentration of circulating vitamin d3 and potentially show a more rapid protective effect, as well as differences in the response to standard- and high-dose treatments."

pmc5968561,"the authors present a strategy to construct mimetics of the hiv-1 gp41 nhr trimeric coiled coils, which are homologous with naturally occurring protein sequences and have extraordinary thermostability. these nhr trimeric coiled coils have promising inhibition against a broad spectrum of laboratory-adapted and primary hiv-1 isolates, including those resistant to clinically used t20. the authors demonstrate that these nhr trimeric coiled coils homologous with naturally occurring protein sequences have extraordinary thermostability, which contributes positively to their promising inhibition of hiv-1 fusion against a broad spectrum of laboratory-adapted and primary isolates, including those resistant to clinically used t20. the authors show that these nhr trimeric coiled coils are less sensitive to proteolysis compared to the unstructured peptide t20 due to their tertiary structural integrity. the authors suggest that this approach could be extendable to the isolation of certain α-helical trimers for basic scientific and therapeutic applications based on the ubiquitous helical protein–protein interactions found in nature."
pmc3963933,"a study on the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  found that the viral agent sars-associated coronavirus  sars-cov  induces apoptosis in human lung epithelial cells, which is a key feature of the pathogenic process. the study also revealed that the apoptosis is mediated by the activation of initiator caspases 8 and 9 and the release of cytochrome c and smac/diablo from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, which are hallmarks of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. the study further identified the viral protein μ1 as a primary determinant of strain-specific differences in apoptotic efficiency, as it is essential for viral attachment and thus for infectivity. the study also suggested that the coexpression of σ3 with μ1 abrogates the capacity of μ1 to induce apoptosis, which highlights the complexity and multifactorial nature of apoptotic pathogenesis. the study's findings provide novel insight into reovirus-induced apoptosis, as the viral virulence of sars-cov is directed against the central nervous system, which is consistent with the cns-directed virulence of other reovirus strains."

pmc6147128,"bats are a diverse and ecologically rich mammalian group with over 1,400 described species, making them an attractive choice to investigate microbiome evolution across closely related species with different ecologies. bats provide a potential solution to the issue of dietary influence on microbiome evolution, as several feeding modes have evolved in parallel two or more times within the order, allowing for the assessment of whether specialization on fruit proceeded via the same bacterial taxa or functions in these divergent host lineages. understanding the microbiomes of bats can help shed light on their ability to carry out important ecosystem functions, such as insect pest control and pollination, and can highlight potential dangers posed by rapid habitat destruction. bat microbes can shed light on disease, immunity, and longevity, as bats are increasingly recognized as important components of zoonotic disease cycles and genomic insights have generated plausible explanations for how bats may have evolved to harbor such deadly microbes. bat microbiomes can be used to understand the links between the microbiome and the evolution of other phenomena of interest, such as immunity and longevity, as bats are exceptionally long-lived for a mammal of their size and many are philopatric to particular roosts, making repeat sampling of individuals throughout their lifetimes possible."
pmc4248250,"the asia-pacific region is facing a range of complex public health challenges, including emerging infectious diseases, a spectrum of regional instability, and health security threats. the region is also experiencing a rapid urbanization, with high mortality rates for infants, children under age 5, and mothers in urban areas. traditional western-based ngos are cautious about working with the military in urban settings, as they see this as a direct contravention of their notions of neutrality. the humanitarian sector's health interventions are surprisingly few evidence-based, and improving the integration of disaster risk reduction into sustainable development policies and planning is crucial to address this spectrum of issues. the asia-pacific region has many problems of disaster risk, including poor regulatory oversight of industry, lack of a safety culture, and poor resources for emergency preparedness. a global authority is required for prevention and preparedness, as individual communities have both unique and discrete local characteristics and risks that must be anticipated and assessed. the majority of countries have not fully complied with the international health regulations treaty, requiring them to report outbreaks promptly to who and take country-wide responsibility to control them. political decision makers are reluctant to engage in discourse with scientists, and scientific advances for the sake of economic dominance are actually accelerating the destruction of public health, global health security, and the environment. the broad disaster relief and humanitarian community has focused primarily on response, with little attention or resources devoted to prevention and preparedness. countries are not prepared to handle emergencies of scarcity, particularly of food, water, and energy, that have a grave impact on import-dependent countries such as china, japan, and south korea, and competitively increase risks for conflict over fishing and petroleum rights in the south china sea."
pmc212558,"the study found an association between the hla-b* 4601 allele and susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  infection, as evidenced by a significantly increased frequency of this allele in severely ill sars patients compared to other groups, including sars patients with less severe disease and healthy controls. the study also found that the hla-b* 1301 allele, which is commonly found in asian populations, was decreased in sars patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a possible association between this allele and resistance to sars infection. the study noted that the hla-b* 4601 allele, which is more commonly found in southern han populations, was also more frequently found in sars patients from southern asian populations, including those from hong kong, vietnam, and singapore, than in northern han populations or in populations from other regions, such as europe or africa. the study suggested that the presence or absence of the hla-b* 4601 allele may have been an important factor in the outbreak of the sars epidemic, as populations with less variation in their hla-related immune repertoires, such as european or african populations, were found to have less of this allele. the study also noted that the hla-b* 1301 allele, which is less frequently found in southern han populations, was not associated with susceptibility to sars infection, but further studies with a larger case-control dataset would be needed to confirm this finding."

pmc114474,"the study revealed that the packaging signal determines the selectivity and efficiency of incorporation of specific rna species into the mhv virus particle, as m protein selectively interacts with rna containing the packaging signal, complexed with n protein, in the presence of the packaging signal. the study demonstrated that binding of m protein to the packaging signal, but not to the 69-nt packaging signal, conferred a relatively higher packaging efficiency than did the 69-nt packaging signal. the study showed that n protein binding to the packaging signal, but not to the 69-nt packaging signal, induced a specific conformational change in n protein that could serve as a nucleation event for the cooperative binding of n protein to the rest of the rna, thereby generating the helical nucleocapsid structure. the study suggested that m protein may efficiently interact only with one specific helical nucleocapsid structure that is ordained by the packaging signal, in the presence of the packaging signal, among a pool of intracellular viral rnp complexes, and that m protein may specifically bind the packaging signal directly. the study implied that the expressed ps5b190 transcripts that were not associated with n protein probably bound to m protein in mhv-infected cells, and that the expressed m protein bound to the expressed ps5b190 transcripts, but not ps5a transcripts, in the absence of n protein."

pmc2649468,"in international collaborative herbal medicine research, there are often significant looming questions about product variability in species, growing conditions, and biologically active constituents at the time herbal medicine trials are proposed, as herbal medicines are already in widespread use, are often used in combination, and are drawn from plant sources with their own variability in species, growing conditions, and biologically active constituents. to address these challenges, researchers increasingly agree that it is important to establish a rational basis for dosing and standardization of biologically active compounds before conducting large-scale clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of herbal medicines. this effort can improve investigators’ ability to assess the risks and benefits of participation in large-scale herbal medicine trials, and more rigorous monitoring of adverse events and standardized reporting of research results for both safety and efficacy data can also be implemented to improve long-term efforts to enhance risk–benefit ratio determination for trial participation. in cross-cultural settings, there may also be a cultural difference in emphasis placed on standardized adverse events reporting. this challenge makes achieving agreed-upon standards of favourable risk–benefit ratio more difficult, and it is important to establish standards of evidence for demonstration of safety before conducting large-scale clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of herbal medicines. in order for international collaborative herbal medicine research to achieve its objectives, it will be important to establish standards of evidence for demonstration of safety before conducting large-scale clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of herbal medicines, and collaborations could “cross-train” basic and clinical investigators to more fully appreciate the concepts and practices of the traditional herbal medicine medicine traditions, and developing host countries would need to develop the basic literacy, knowledge, and skills among traditional medicine practitioners so that they see the value of rigorous clinical research. in international collaborative herbal medicine research, there is rarely a strong preclinical basis for dosing, and there are significant looming questions about product variability in species, growing conditions, and biologically active constituents at the time herbal medicine trials are proposed, as herbal medicines are already in widespread use, are often used in combination, and are drawn from plant sources with their own variability in species, growing conditions, and biologically active constituents. to address these challenges, it is important to establish"

pmc7019290,"the use of metagenomic next-generation sequencing  ngs  has allowed for the characterization of all viruses present in samples, as well as the discovery of novel or uncommon infectious etiologies. this is important as many viruses that affect animals are zoonotic, and can also cause disease in humans. in the reviewed literature, the viromes of farm animals were relatively comparable, as many infections are subclinical, and disease association studies require deeper taxonomic annotation of virus sequences to the level of genus and species. multiple signature viruses would be required to set up a viral fingerprint profile for each livestock type, as one genetic marker may not be sensitive and/or specific enough. the current state of the art is far from providing such information as the minimal metadata that is needed to select datasets for analysis, as over 90% and 40% of available studies did not specify farm type and age of farm animals. this limitation hampers cross-study comparison and future large-scale reanalysis and interpretation. the reviewed literature primarily focused on fecal virome, probably because fecal samples of farm animals are a non-invasive sample and are readily available to be collected. however, viral shedding of emerging viruses, such as eid viruses, can also occur in respiratory secretions, and viral mngs studies of respiratory samples of farm animals are substantially overlooked and underreported. the review highlights that data should be properly indexed and easy to find and assess, with rich and well-defined metadata that can be interpreted by humans and computers. by making metagenomic data “fair”, reusability of the data can be optimized so the data can be combined into meta-analysis settings, which is important for future large-scale farm animal virome characterization analysis that can guide zoonotic outbreak preparedness."
pmc4629194,"the study presents a sirs network model to describe the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic, which reveals that the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic are closely related to three parameters  the fluctuation of the infection rate, the small infection probability in nature, and the average degree of network. the study suggests that a persistent is necessary to ignite another outbreak, and it is also consistent with practical cases where there is always a small possibility for infected seeds to be generated naturally. the study suggests that reducing the natural infection probability from the environment or unknown reasons can help control the recurrent outbreaks, as individuals may have different habitus and thus may need different times to recover. the study suggests that increasing the contagious rate of infection can also help control the recurrent outbreaks, as it provides sufficient susceptible people to induce an outbreak. the study suggests that an effective way to control the recurrent outbreaks can be found by considering these three factors, as they work together to generate the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic."

pmc2849084,"the authors found that sars-cov mpro undergoes substrate-induced dimerization, which is reversible upon removal of the substrates. this dimerization is a dynamic equilibrium between the active and inactive protomers, and substrate binding induces and stabilizes enzyme dimerization, which then activates the enzyme molecule. mutation of arg-298 or gln-299 to alanine significantly reduces the enzyme activity, while mutation of both residues to alanine abolishes the enzyme activity. this suggests that both arg-298 and gln-299 are involved in the rate-limiting step for mpro catalysis. the authors found that the wild-type mpro is a dimer, while mutation of arg-298 in r298a significantly reduces the enzyme activity. however, mutation of both arg-298 and glu-166 in r298a/l significantly blocks the substrate-induced dimerization. the authors found that the enzyme activity of the wild-type mpro and its mutants, r298a and r298a/l, shows a nonlinear upward dependence between the enzyme activity and enzyme concentration. the authors found that the enzyme concentration-dependent enzyme activity experiment indicated that only the dimer is enzymatically active, and the protein-concentration-dependent enzyme activity experiment showed a significant size shifting toward the dimeric form in the presence of peptide substrates. this suggests that there is a rapid equilibrium between the monomer and dimer in solution, and the protein-concentration-dependent enzyme activity experiment showed that in the presence of peptide substrates, the major species of the r298a/l mutants showed significant size shifting toward the dimeric form, which became clear in the d2o environment. the substrate-induced dimerization of r298a/l was reversible upon removal of the substrates."

pmc4625113,"a study optimized an indirect elisa for detecting antibodies against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  pedv  in fecal and serum samples. the assay utilized a spike protein antigen derived from a pedv genogroup 2 strain, which can be applied to antigens from other pedv strains. the method was validated using 69 paired samples from pigs with known pedv exposure, and cut-off values for positivity were determined based on the mean s/p ratios of pedv-negative samples plus three standard deviations. the assay showed a significant positive correlation between fecal and serum anti-pedv igg levels. the study found that background pedv infection is widespread in pig populations, with most pedv strains belonging to genogroup 1 prior to 2010, and more recent outbreaks associated with pedv genogroup 2. the study highlights the importance of accurate and timely diagnosis of pedv infection, as pedv causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in pigs of any age with often high mortality in neonatal piglets, and recent outbreaks have been reported in europe, north america, and south america. the study emphasizes that due to the similarities in clinical signs with other enteric pathogens, measurement of localized igg immune responses is critical to evaluate protection, as detection of these antibodies only indicates that individuals had previous contact with infectious microorganisms, or were vaccinated. the study suggests that testing fecal samples or oral fluids for assessing local pedv immunity in pig herds is feasible, as a good correlation was found between the levels of pedv igg antibodies in serum and fecal samples, and future studies should also assess oral fluid samples for suitability as a sample type to assess herd immunity."
pmc3356181,"in a study on the potential use of mannosylated iron oxide nanoparticles  uspio  for imaging atherosclerotic plaques, researchers found that both d- and dm-uspio particles were phagocytosed by macrophages embedded in atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in a susceptibility-induced signal reduction in the aortic vessel wall on t1-weighted 3d gradient echo  gre  images. this effect was greater for dm-uspio than for d-uspio, indicating that dm-uspio is superior to d-uspio for the study of atherosclerotic lesions. histological analyses showed that the uptake of dm- was higher than that of d-uspio in the aortic wall of rabbits, resulting in a greater reduction of signal from the aortic wall in mri scans. the distribution of dm-uspio in the liver and lung tended to be higher than that of d-uspio, suggesting that receptor-mediated endocytosis had a strong role in the internalization of dm-uspio by macrophages. in efforts to avoid potential bias due to roi placement affecting the results of imaging analysis, the average result from three different rois in snr measurements was used. the authors suggest that the observed differences in the uptake of dm- and d-uspio by rabbit atherosclerotic lesions are attributable to the binding of mannan to uspio, and further study is required to investigate the stability of bound mannan and to determine optimum dosage amounts. the authors posit that macrophages contained in atherosclerotic plaques are more sensitive to dm- than to d-uspio, making it possible to acquire plaque images at lower doses of contrast agent, and suggest that the affinity of dm-uspio particles for the atherosclerotic wall affects their uptake positively, but acknowledge that the amount of iron per unit weight was not different irrespective of the type of uspio used, and attribute this to technical difficulties with their preliminary arrangements for making nmr measurements."
pmc2791869,"the study found that the basic reproduction number  r0  for the novel influenza a/h1n1 virus in germany is estimated to be 1.58, with a range of 1.34 to 2.04. this is based on assumptions made about the age distribution and size of the population in germany, as well as the severity and infectiousness of the virus. the study also found that children  under the age of 15  are less susceptible to infection with the novel influenza a/h1n1 virus than adults. specifically, the study estimated that children have a basic reproduction number  r0  of 2.06, with a range of 1.60 to 3.31, compared to adults, who have an r0 of 1.58. the study suggests that intensive measures, such as isolation and therapy of cases, are necessary to control the spread of the novel influenza a/h1n1 virus. these measures were assumed to be maintained for the first 100 cases, followed by less intensive measures focusing on the household. the study found that a high number of imported cases could lead to a significant delay in the peak of the epidemic. this is illustrated in figure s4, which shows the delay in days depending on the number of imported cases, as well as the case detection rate. the study also suggests that contact tracing and post-exposure prophylaxis are effective in controlling the spread of the novel influenza a/h1n1 virus, as these measures were assumed to be implemented for the first 500 detected cases, followed by less intensive measures focusing on the household. the effectiveness of these measures is reflected in the delay of the epidemic curve, as shown in figure s3."

pmc3840050,"the structural analysis of sars-cov receptor interactions has revealed that critical residue changes in sars-cov and host receptor proteins present major species barriers for viral infections and determine host range and cross-species transmission. sars-cov adapted to civet and human ace2 proteins by strengthening the binding affinity to their receptors through mutations in the receptor-binding domain  rbd  of its spike protein. mice support sars-cov infection at low levels because of the k353h residue change in their ace2, but rats are resistant to sars-cov infection because of the k353h and m82n double residue changes. through natural evolutions of its rbd at key positions, sars-cov overcame the species barriers between some animal species, but not others. a structure-based prediction of future sars-cov evolution suggests that if sars-cov were given the opportunity to keep infecting humans and evolving in human cells, it could evolve into a human-optimized form with substantial affinity for human ace2."
pmc2323977,"a protease inhibitor, ben-hcl, can effectively suppress sars-cov infection, and it appears to inhibit viral entry into target cells but does not appear to block other steps of viral replication. the s protein of sars-cov is cleaved into functional s1 and s2 subunits by the protease factor xa, which is expressed by target cells and is able to effectively cleave the full-length recombinant s protein into s1 and s2 subunits. the cleavage of the s protein into functional s1 and s2 subunits is inhibited by ben-hcl, and the level of cleavage correlates with viral infectivity. the target cells express factor xa, a membrane-bound protease, and the cleavage of the s protein may trigger virus-cell fusion subsequent to the binding with the ace2 receptor and the dissociation of trimeric s protein to monomers. inhibition of the cleavage of the s protein into functional s1 and s2 subunits using agents such as ben-hcl can effectively block viral entry."
pmc4561613,"a study in new zealand found that among arriving airline passengers, 17% reported respiratory symptoms and 1% tested positive for influenza virus. however, entry screening for influenza infection would be either very resource intensive  testing and potentially quarantining 17% of arriving travelers using “any symptom”  or ineffective  allowing 97% of infected arrivals to enter the community if measured fever was used . the study also found that among this population, entry screening for influenza infection would be either very resource intensive  testing and potentially quarantining 17% of arriving travelers using “any symptom”  or ineffective  allowing 97% of infected arrivals to enter the community if measured fever was used . lower response rates to health questionnaires at younger ages may have led to some bias in estimates of the prevalence of symptoms and of influenza, as younger respondents had a higher prevalence of symptoms than did older respondents. the study was carried out during a “normal” influenza season, when the predominant strain was influenza b.16, and found that during influenza pandemics, the prevalence of influenza among travelers might be higher than in this study, which would improve ppvs but also mean that more asymptomatic infected travelers would enter the community  because of the poor sensitivity of screening criteria . the study also found that among this population, entry screening for influenza infection would be either very resource intensive  testing and potentially quarantining 17% of arriving travelers using “any symptom”  or ineffective  allowing 97% of infected arrivals to enter the community if measured fever was used , as a proportion of those infected with influenza will be asymptomatic on arrival and some people with symptoms will not report them."
pmc3291344,"the study found that clinical case finding detected inhalational anthrax outbreaks on average 3.7-4.6 days after the release of spores, and the ability of syndromic surveillance to detect an outbreak before clinical case finding was influenced by both specificity and release size, with specificity being the predominant factor. the study showed that syndromic surveillance could detect an inhalational anthrax outbreak before clinical case finding in as many as half of simulated outbreaks, but the potential detection benefit of syndromic surveillance compared with clinical case finding depended critically on the specificity and sensitivity at which a surveillance system operated and on the size of the outbreak. the study found that to help detect outbreaks more rapidly, future research should examine the cost-effectiveness of syndromic surveillance and explore approaches to linking syndromic surveillance and clinical case finding more closely. the study revealed that the detection benefit of syndromic surveillance compared with clinical case finding was influenced strongly by the specificity at which a surveillance system operated, and public health authorities should be aware that the potential detection benefit of syndromic surveillance compared with clinical case finding is influenced critically by the specificity at which a surveillance system operates. the study suggested that syndromic surveillance may also be useful for applications other than detecting an outbreak caused by bioterrorism, such as for ruling out the existence of an outbreak or for evaluating the effect of a public health intervention."

pmc6702889,"in the section on vaccine development against t. gondii, the authors highlight the limitations of current vaccine strategies, including the risk of reverting to a virulent form in live-attenuated vaccines and the need for refrigeration in dna vaccines. they also note that previous studies have shown that vaccines expressing only a single antigen or stage of the parasite life cycle generate partial immune protection against t. gondii. the authors also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of epitope-based vaccines against t. gondii. they note that this vaccine strategy shows chemical stability, low or lack of resulting immunogenicity during antigen processing and presentation, and decreased biohazard risk. however, they also point out that the prediction and validation of highly immunogenic epitopes is crucial in designing any potential epitope vaccine, and that the variation among epitopic regions may affect the prediction process. the authors provide a list of predicted epitopes evaluated as potential epitope-based vaccine candidates against t. gondii  table 1 . they also note that recent studies have shown that a synthetic vaccine expressing a mixture of single b and t cell epitopes generated significant immune protection against t. gondii, including long-term survival rates. the authors also mention that the use of epitope-based antigens is highly promising in the development of potential vaccine candidates against t. gondii and could aid in achieving potential vaccines. they suggest that future studies should explore the use of appropriate adjuvants and establish optimal immunization protocols along with evaluation criteria. the authors also discuss the potential role of bioinformatics in analyzing immunogenic epitopes and predicting potential epitopes. they note that bioinformatics tools represent a powerful alternative strategy in epitopes discovery, as it significantly reduces the cost, time, and effort involved in experimental approaches. however, they also point out that the differences in pathogens genotypes and subtypes should be taken into account while selecting immunogenic epitopes."

pmc3891532,"a study in china has reported the first detection of porcine torovirus  ptov  in swine with diarrhea, and molecular epidemiology was conducted. ptov was detected in 9 out of 20 farms, with two farms testing positive for ptov alone, suggesting the possibility of individual animal infection. sequence analysis confirmed that the chinese ptov strains were closely related to each other and to the european and spanish strains, indicating that different ptov strains can circulate simultaneously in an area. high incidence of ptov infection was observed in swine with diarrhea, and two diarrhea samples were tested positive for ptov alone, as reported in a previous study. the study suggests the need for further studies to reveal the epidemiological status of ptov infection in china and to develop an immunological method to detect serological prevalence of porcine torovirus in chinese swine herds. the study highlights the importance of including ptov examination in the diagnosis of porcine diarrhea, as the impossibility of growing the virus in culture cells has precluded the development of ptov diagnostics."
pmc1900113,"infected common marmosets developed a fatal systemic viral disease with multifocal hepatocellular necrosis, lymphoid depletion, and adrenal necrosis, as well as interstitial pneumonitis and lymphocytic interstitial nephritis. the liver was a principal target for lassa virus infection, with multifocal hepatocellular necrosis associated with a mild inflammation presented predominantly by ham56-positive macrophages and a lack of expression of mhc-ii antigen. lymphoid depletion was observed in the spleen and lymph nodes, with a marked reduction in the intensity of hla-dr staining in lymph nodes. a characteristic finding in the liver was acidophilic structures resembling apoptotic, councilman-like bodies seen in sinusoids but also occasionally within kupffer cells. the relationship between liver damage and hematological dysfunctions leading to shock remains unclear, as intracerebral inoculation of lassa virus into adult mice caused outbreaks of callithrix jacchus hepatitis in captive marmosets and tamarins in zoos and animal parks in the united states and europe."

pmc4283225,"the study identified 11 potential human micrornas  mirnas  with significant sequence identity to the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus  mers-cov  genome, out of which 10 have not been previously associated with any function in humans or other animals. these mirnas, including hsa-mir-628-5p, hsa-mir-18a-3p, and hsa-mir-332-3p, have been linked to various diseases such as cancers, cardiovascular disease, schizophrenia, psoriasis, and primary muscular disorders. the study found that the mirna hsa-mir-628-5p, which is associated with most common brain cancer glioma, acts as a protective factor during glioma progression, and its expression decreases gradually as the cancer progresses. another mirna, hsa-mir-18a-3p, is unregulated in basal cell carcinoma  bcc  of the skin compared with non-lesional skin, and its target genes are predominantly involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion during the process of malignant transformation. the study also found that hsa-mir-332-3p is linked to idiopathic prion disease and its upregulation may be a general phenomenon in late-stage prion disease, which could potentially be used as a novel marker for animal and human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  tses . the findings suggest that the identified mirnas, including hsa-mir-628-5p, hsa-mir-6804-3p, hsa-mir-4289, hsa-mir-208a-3p, hsa-mir-510-3p, hsa-mir-18a-3p, hsa-mir-329-3p, hsa-mir-548ax, hsa-mir-3934-5p, hsa-mir-4474-5p, hsa-"
pmc6383881,"the study demonstrated effective results in the inactivation of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses spiked into commercially collected animal plasma using a uv-c turbulator system. the enveloped viruses, including prrsv, bvdv, and pedv, were more susceptible to uv-c irradiation than non-enveloped viruses, such as ppv, svdv, and pcv-2. this difference was observed at lower uv-c doses, with enveloped viruses requiring lower doses for inactivation compared to non-enveloped viruses. the study found that the inactivation curve for ppv, a non-enveloped virus, demonstrated a minimal residual level of ppv at the highest dose  9000 j/l , while subsequent passages detected very low residual viral infectivity, suggesting the presence of a resistant viral subpopulation. the study found that uv-c inactivation of liquid plasma during the manufacturing process for sdap has a potential application for inactivation of microbial contaminants without causing negative effects on the nutritional or physical qualities of the treated material. the study found that the uv-c mechanism of inactivation  dna or rna damage  is different than the thermal inactivation provided by the spray-drying step. in consequence, the uv-c step can be considered independent from the spray-drying process and may be a synergistic process as both procedures have different inactivation targets. the study found that obtained results with viruses evaluated in this study suggest that uv-c inactivation susceptibility of both types of viral genome  dsdna and ssrna  was similar, and the longer genome size did not appear to increase virus susceptibility to uv-c radiation when spiked into commercially collected animal plasma and exposed to uv-c. however, a weak linear trend  r2 = 0.43  was found in the current data when comparing genome size to the 4d of viruses  without outlier’s results pedv and prv ."
pmc4910891,"the study found that experimental respiratory viral infection can result in increases in carriage density of common bacteria or increases in acquisition, raising the possibility that bacteria exploit the ubiquitous respiratory viral infections of early childhood to promote colonization and transmission while minimizing serious pathology in their hosts. the study confirmed an association between carriage of haemophilus influenzae and rhinitis in healthy children and found a potential increase in bacterial acquisition induced by the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. the study found that colonization at the time of vaccination was associated with greater overall rises in density, suggesting that increases in bacterial load were due not to acquisition of new strains but to proliferation of those already present. the study detected and quantified species-specific bacterial dna using pcr rather than viable bacteria by conventional culture techniques and found that individuals with discordant pcr and culture results tend to have low density colonization. the study found that changes in nasal bacterial colonization density were evident around 28 days after immunization, raising questions about the time course of this effect in children."

pmc5869531,"in the section discussing the two-stage model of viral assembly, the authors present evidence from studies on bacteriophage ms2, plant virus satellite tobacco necrosis virus  stnv , and hepatitis b virus  hbv  and members of the picornaviridae, suggesting that multiple discrete packing sequences  pps  exist on the genomes of viruses and serve as binding sites for capsid proteins  cp  of the virus. this model proposes that stage 1 refers to the collapse of the rna into a condensed form, followed by the addition of further cp molecules in stage 2. this model suggests that multiple pps dispersed throughout the genome define the incorporation of cp and the eventual assembly of the particle, unlike in alphaviruses, where no such lattice of rna density has been identified in reconstructed capsid structures or whole virus particles. in the section discussing the assembly of alphavirus nucleocapsid  ncs , the authors present evidence suggesting that alphavirus ncs may assemble through an alternative mechanism, which may involve specific rna sequences making contacts with the n-terminal domain of the cp, followed by electrostatically driven assembly. however, they also mention that traditional approaches have identified some viruses with singular rna secondary structures, described as a pps, which are able to nucleate cp. this initates an electrostatically driven assembly process, but many viruses do not conform to this model, as a single pps could not be identified. in the same section, the authors mention that traditional approaches have also identified specific cp-rna interactions generated during assembly or upon disassembly that alter the kinetics of viral growth in a subsequent cell, as suggested by sokolowski et al.  2017 . in the section discussing the assembly of alphavirus nucleocapsid  ncs , the authors also mention that further questions about alphavirus assembly include determining how the cp or genome rna traffics to sites of assembly and investigating the role of the cp upon entry into new cells. in the same section, the authors mention that the current evidence suggests that spherules begin biogenesis at the plasma membrane  pm  and then become cp-containing ncs, but the question of how the ncs forms is a"
pmc5348035,"two amino acid substitutions, p305l and n345d, were identified in the capsid protein vp60 of rabbit hemorrhagic virus  rhdv  after serial passaging under immune pressure. these mutations, along with a silent substitution in the viral polymerase, are beneficial under antibody selection and rapidly became fixed in virus populations. continued passaging did not produce a complete immune escape variant. this observation is consistent with the idea of ‘diminishing returns epistasis’, where the rate of fitness increase diminishes over time in the shape of a logarithmic function. the average number of polymorphisms that appeared per passage was comparable between selected and control groups. however, the number of polymorphisms clearly increased in later passages compared with earlier passages in both selected and control rabbits. the g27s mutation  nucleotide position 517  within the p23/26 coding region was consistently present at a relatively low frequency in animals with and without antibody treatment, in all except two passages. overall, the passage 10 virus was highly virulent during passaging experiments, causing clinical rhd within 48 hours post-infection and the onset of terminal signs by 4 days post-infection."
pmc3464021,"empirical studies have found that genetic variation in host populations can reduce the spread of infectious diseases, such as malaria in wild populations of anopheles mosquitoes  altermatt and ebert, 2008  and bacterial infections in wild populations of daphnia magna  ganz and ebert, 2010 . these studies suggest that a 'handful' of host genotypes with genetic variation in resistance can be enough to reduce disease spread, as opposed to the traditional view that host populations should be homogenous to reduce transmission. theoretical models also support the idea that genetic variation in host populations can reduce disease spread. a recent model suggests that increases in the genetic diversity of host populations can have a large effect on disease spread, as long as each parasite genotype can only infect one genetically determined resistance phenotype in the host population  lively, 2010a . this assumption is consistent with the 'matching-alleles' model for infection, which is supported by studies on invertebrate immunity  grosberg and hart, 2000; carius et al., 2001; dybdahl et al., 2008; duneau et al., 2011; luijckx et al., 2011 . the model suggests that r0, the average number of secondary infections produced by a single infected host, depends on total host density and the frequency of matching host genotypes, where matches between host and parasite genotypes yield an infection. the effect of host density on r0 is density dependent and asymptotic on bgi, where gi is the frequency of the matching host genotype, and b is the number of parasite propagules produced by each infection that make contact with a host. empirical studies have found that high genetic diversity in host populations can buffer host populations against disease spread in natural populations of vertebrates, such as cheetahs, sea lions, fish, and frogs  unpublished data . these findings suggest that there is a threshold value for the genetic diversity of host populations above which parasites can be eliminated. determining the threshold value may have great value for conserving endangered species and mediating vector-human-parasite transmission. empirical studies have"

pmc2995068,"nsp13 helicase, belonging to the non-processive family, exhibits substantial processivity in unwinding duplex nucleic acids in vitro through functional cooperativity rather than structural contacts between helicase monomers. the length of the ss region at the 5'-side of the dna duplex is a major determinant for the efficiency of dna unwinding by nsp13, as unwinding of longer substrates is facilitated by functional cooperativity of multiple nsp13 monomers loaded on the same ssdna track. nsp13 helicase more efficiently unwinds partial-duplex nucleic acid substrates containing ss regions at the 5'-side that are long enough to allow the binding of multiple monomers. chemical cross-linking assay shows that oligomerization of nsp13 is an intrinsic property of the protein, which is facilitated in the presence of long ssdna and atp. nsp13 helicase has a higher degree of cross-linking in the presence of longer ssdna and atp, suggesting that a dynamic oligomeric status of the helicase might exist in the presence of ssdna."

pmc5883611,"the study reports the first cryo-electron microscopy  cryo-em  asymmetric reconstruction of bacteriophage p22 after it has released its packaged double-stranded dna chromosome. the study reveals that the portal structure in empty p22 particles remains essentially unchanged inside the capsid after dna release and does not revert to the conformation observed in mature virions. the study shows that the portal structure in empty p22 particles undergoes a conformational change with respect to the conformation observed in mature virions, with the top of the c-terminal barrel appearing to be splayed out in the empty particle. the study identifies a substantial density, not present in virions, that extends away from gp10 at the distal tip of the short tail in empty p22 particles. this density is not affected by ""surfboards,"" which appear in less than 10% of the particles, and is not ascribed to gp26 because these particles have a premature stop at codon 53 in gene 26. the study hypothesizes that this short tube-like density may serve as a precursor assembly in the formation of a longer tube comprised of the other ejection proteins, and the longer tube is used to deliver the virion genome into the host cytoplasm through the outer membrane, peptidoglycan layer, periplasmic space, and inner membrane."

pmc4451415,"the nucleocapsid proteins of several enveloped rna viruses, including coronaviruses, arteriviruses, flaviviruses, and paramyxoviruses, possess nuclear localization signals  nls  and transiently localize into the nucleus or nucleolus during the viral life cycle. the nuclear localization of nucleocapsid protein of enveloped rna viruses supports viral proliferation by interfering with the host's immune response or other mechanisms, including maintaining the balance of nucleocapsid protein rna molecules for optimal production of the functional viral genome. targeting the nuclear export of these proteins presents an opportunity for the development of small molecule inhibitors or live-attenuated vaccine candidates, as inhibition of their nuclear localization could negatively impact on the production of infectious viral particles and cell-to-cell spread. the nuclear localization of nucleocapsid protein also presents an opportunity for the development of attenuated vaccine candidates, as mutations that disable the nuclear/nucleolar localization function, without hampering the cytoplasmic function of nucleocapsid proteins, could result in viruses that replicate, albeit to lesser degree due to reduced ability to inhibit antiviral responses. the nuclear localization of nucleocapsid protein of enveloped rna viruses has potential as a target for the development of live-attenuated vaccines or antiviral drugs, as inhibition of its nuclear localization could negatively impact on the production of infectious viral particles and cell-to-cell spread."

pmc2838095,"the study reveals that hepatitis b surface antigen  hbsag  expression and secretion in cells and in mice can induce the secretion of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant  cinc , also known as chemokine  c-x3, c-x3, c-x3, c-x3 , which is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, monocytes, t lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. the study shows that hbsag-expressing mice exhibit elevated serum levels of cinc, which is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells surrounding hbsag-positive hepatocytes. the study indicates that the inflammatory effect observed is associated with hbsag expression and secretion but not due to a general induction by the expression of an irrelevant foreign protein, as pretreatment with cyclosporine  cs , which is known to block the chemotactic function of cinc, reduces the serum cinc to the normal levels and prevents the infiltration of lymphocytes in the liver. the study suggests that the anti-cinc receptor protein, cd147, is involved in inducing inflammatory responses in the studied mouse model, as anti-cd147 antibody treatment decreases the serum cinc and inflammatory foci in the liver. the study reveals that cinc secretion induced by hbsag expression and secretion might contribute to the pathogenesis of hbv infection, as serum cinc appears to be higher in chronic hbv patients than in healthy subjects, and the majority of patients after liver transplantation exhibit a reduction in serum cinc."
pmc1280202,"in a study investigating the effects of gene-based vaccination and protein adjuvant combinations on immune responses, it was found that dna priming followed by adenoviral boosting for several antigens can elicit strong cd4 and cd8 cellular immune responses, while protein vaccines typically utilize adjuvants that elicit strong cd4 responses and minimal cd8 responses. rad vector boosting, on the other hand, elicits strong cd8 responses, but the antibody response is substantial. the study also revealed that inactivated virus with adjuvant can boost animals primed with rad vectors, leading to an antigen-specific increase in cd4 responses and a diminished cd8 response, which is similar in magnitude to the stimulation seen without boosting. the cd8 response was not affected either by the antigen or by the adjuvant. the study suggests that the ability to stimulate the cd4 responses may be desirable if the immune response is largely dependent on neutralizing antibodies, as several s glycoproteins have been identified that are resistant to neutralization, and recent data suggest that the antibody-resistant strains preferentially recognize the civet ace-2 protein. the study found that the ability to perform a prime-boost immunization with clinically relevant products, such as inactivated virus, and to analyze their immunogenicity affords an opportunity to examine synergy between these different vaccine candidates that have clinical implications. the study highlights the need to recognize that vaccines for animal coronaviruses which rely on humoral immunity have not proven efficacious and that current animal models of sars infection that faithfully replicate human disease do not exist. therefore, it is presently not possible to evaluate relative vaccine efficacy, and a variety of novel approaches, including adaptation of virus to different species, the development of transgenic animals expressing the human ace-2 receptor, and the use of aged animals in challenge models, may assist in this effort in the future."

pmc1140532,"ribavirin and viramidine, two purine nucleoside analogs, can be phosphorylated by cytosolic nucleoside diphosphate kinase  cn-ii  and adenosine kinase, but the lower catalytic efficiency values reported in this study suggest that like ribavirin, viramidine phosphorylation by cn-ii is likely to be physiologically relevant due to its lower catalytic efficiency value  0.16 versus 1.8 min−1  and high km value  >600 μm  in comparison to ribavirin. the ribavirin-specific cn-ii activity is much better than that by adenosine kinase, and the ribavirin km value  88 μm  is in the micromolar range, which is lower than that of most cn-ii substrates  18  whose km values are in the millimolar range. the lower catalytic efficiency values reported in this study reflect the intrinsic catalytic power of cn-ii and adenosine kinase towards ribavirin and viramidine, and the respective contribution of each enzyme for ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation is likely determined by the concentrations of individual enzymes and various effectors present in vivo. the high-level ribavirin can deplete intracellular atp, impair atp-dependent oxidative respiratory pathway, damage rbc membrane integrity, and eventually cause hemolytic anemia in rbcs. the slow dephosphorylation of ribavirin or the lack of ribavirin-specific nucleotidase and/or phosphatase should play a key role in accumulating ribavirin, which only amasses to a high level in rbcs. the relatively fast anabolism of ribavirin in rbcs should also contribute to the accumulation of ribavirin, and the slow catabolism of ribavirin or the lack of ribavirin-specific nucleotidase and/or phosphatase should play a key role in accumulating ribavirin, which only amasses"

pmc3994909,"a study by southern research institute in collaboration with the galveston national laboratory has successfully implemented an hts platform in bsl-4 containment using nipah virus as a prototype bsl-4 virus. this platform allows for the screening of up to 10,000 compounds from small molecule libraries at a single dose, and up to 1000 hit compounds for concentration-dependent dose response, per day. three sulfonamide compounds with ec50 values less than 12 μm and selectivity values ranging from 3 to 13 have been identified as hits in the hts assay against nipah virus. all three hit compounds inhibit nipah virus infection for up to 6 hours post-infection, suggesting that each compound targets the virus during the very late stage of the virus's replication, rather than the early entry or later stages of assembly. a previous report by southern research institute identified three hit compounds with ec50 values less than 12 μm and selectivity values ranging from 3 to 13 in an hts assay against nipah virus. these compounds have not been identified as hits in any other bioassay, indicating that they are specific for nipah virus, or possibly other henipaviruses. the development of hts technology for bsl-4 addresses the dual threat of emerging pathogens that exhibit high mobility and mortality and the possibility of these pathogens being used as a bioterrorist weapon. the hts platform provides a crucial, needed tool for modern drug development against highly pathogenic viruses."
pmc5964435,"in the context of network theory, this study highlights the importance of contact networks in the spread of infectious diseases. the findings suggest that structure and characteristics of contact networks can significantly affect the rate of transmission of mers disease. the study identifies patients with high degree of centrality as epidemic attenuators, as they are linked to many secondary cases that did not produce any further secondary cases of their own. patients with high betweenness, on the other hand, are identified as epidemic amplifiers, as they are a pathway to infect other patients. the results show that healthcare facilities and healthcare workers are the most crucial factors in driving national epidemics of mers. hospital infections display higher interconnectivity, and, on average, are linked to patients that are more connected to highly connected patients than nonhospital infections. the study emphasizes the importance of limiting access to other patients and quarantines, as most important nodes are found within hospitals, and healthcare workers are more prone to the infection. reducing contact formation especially within hospitals by restricting hospital visitation for mers patient families and reducing the number of healthcare workers with access to mers patients will significantly affect the spread of mers disease. the findings also suggest that a high proportion of healthcare workers feel at risk of contracting the disease but are obliged to care for mers patients, as a high percentage of healthcare workers do not feel safe at work using standard precautions. in terms of the number of connected contacts, nodes 1664, 1025, 124, 133, and 897 were identified as critical in the spread of mers to other cases using the betweenness metric, and these patients acted as a bridge connecting other smaller secondary cases and thus the spread of mers infection by further connecting with other secondary cases who also connect other important cases."

pmc3754090,"the newly discovered rhabdovirus, basv, shares structural similarities with other rhabdovirus glycoproteins, such as the internal bipartite fusion loop motif, but its length is significantly greater, with an additional 100 to 150 amino acids. mutations in the three aromatic amino acids in the fusion loops, which are critical for vsv-g-mediated fusion, also lead to a loss of function in basv-g. basv-g, similar to vsv-g and certain herpesvirus glycoproteins, exists in a dynamic equilibrium of pre- and postfusion conformations, but its threshold ph to induce fusion activity is lower, at <5.5, and its temperature optimum is higher, keeping increasing at temperatures above 37°c. basv-g, unlike vsv-g and chikv env, interacts with c-type lectins like dc-sign, dc-signr, and signr1 to enhance infection of lectin-expressing target cells. the pseudotype system described in the study will be a practical tool to determine the seroprevalence and clinical relevance of basv infection and to allow the development of prophylactic and therapeutic intervention strategies for basv infection."

pmc3010063,"palmitoylation is a posttranslational modification that plays a crucial role in regulating protein function and localization. it involves the covalent attachment of a 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitate, to cysteine residues in proteins. palmitoylation is catalyzed by a family of enzymes called dhhc acyltransferases  dhhcs , which are localized to intracellular membranes. these enzymes transfer palmitate from phosphatidylcholine  pc  to specific cysteine residues in their substrate proteins. palmitoylation is a highly regulated process that is tightly controlled by both positive and negative regulatory factors. positive regulators include intracellular calcium ions, phosphorylation, and g proteins, while negative regulators include protein kinase c  pkc  and protein tyrosine phosphatase  ptp . depalmitoylation is the reverse process of palmitoylation, which is catalyzed by thioesterases. these enzymes remove palmitate groups from previously palmitoylated proteins, thus reversing the effects of palmitoylation. palmitoylation and depalmitoylation are important for the spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular membrane fusion reactions, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as vesicle transport, membrane trafficking, and synaptic transmission. dysregulation of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation has been implicated in various diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders."

pmc1865980,"ata, a small molecule, inhibits the replication of vaccinia virus, a close relative of smallpox and monkeypox viruses, by down-regulating the activity of the enzyme h1l and inhibiting the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase  mapk  pathway component erk. the inhibition of h1l by ata occurs through the inhibition of its tyrosine phosphatase activity, as demonstrated by in vitro enzyme activity assays, with an ic50 value of approximately 2.2 μg/ml. the low toxicity of ata, as evidenced by its cc50 values and its easy reversibility of its effect on cells, combined with its potent and selective inhibition of vaccinia virus replication, makes it an ideal drug candidate for further study. ata strongly inhibits erk phosphorylation, as evidenced by the drastic decrease in its phosphorylated state, as early as 10 minutes post-treatment, and the sustained inhibition throughout the time course. ata inhibition of erk phosphorylation is required during the early stage of vaccinia virus replication, as demonstrated by the observation that ata treatment during infection is required to have any inhibitory effect, and the absence of ata in the first hour of infection results in viral titers approaching those of untreated controls, followed by the removal of the ata and the return of the level of erk phosphorylation to control levels."
pmc4552657,"the paper describes two methods to streamline the production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies  mabs . the first method uses surface plasmon resonance  spr  with a small amount of primary hybridoma supernatant to rapidly identify the isotype and affinity of mabs for native antigens. the second method uses flow cytometry to isolate antigen-specific hybridomas from a heterogeneous mixture grown in bulk immediately following fusion. both methods greatly reduce the time and effort required to go from the initial fusion to the isolation of hybridoma clones producing mabs of the appropriate specificity and functions for downstream applications. the paper demonstrates that fluorescently labelled antigens can be used to single-cell sort antigen-specific hybridoma cells from a fusion bulk mixture directly. this method can be used to identify either rare cells in hybridoma cultures that have switched to useful genetically downstream isotypes or rare antigen-specific hybridomas in a heterogeneous mixture of hybridoma cells grown in bulk immediately following fusion. the paper shows that hybridoma cell surface expression of mabs allows for the isolation of antigen-specific hybridomas in a heterogeneous mixture grown in bulk immediately following fusion. this method can be used to identify mabs suitable for research, commercial, and therapeutic uses. the paper demonstrates that the surface form of igg receptor on hybridoma cells lacks the signaling igα co-receptor. this finding may be of some advantage in the uses proposed in the paper involving engagement of the surface igg by antibody or antigen in order to isolate the cell, as the lack of signaling through the engaged receptor may head off activation untoward downstream signaling pathway that could induce apoptosis. the paper describes a method for optimizing the production and characterization of mabs, especially those specific for epitopes present on native proteins. the method allows for the rapid identification of mabs suitable for research, commercial, and therapeutic uses. the paper also describes a method for isolating antigen-specific hybridomas from a heterogeneous mixture grown in bulk immediately following fusion, using flow cytometry to take advantage of the strong correlation between hybridoma secreted and surface igg. this method can be used to find appropriate mabs for research, commercial, and therapeut"

pmc2666290,"in a study examining the geographic distribution of resource gaps in response to a pandemic influenza, it was found that provinces with smaller population sizes and lower population densities may face significant challenges in mobilizing resources due to the limited availability of healthcare facilities and resources. this limitation was observed in thailand, where the city of bangkok, with a population of 10 million people and over 65 private hospitals with more than 50,000 beds, was excluded from the study. the study also highlighted the importance of addressing gaps in resources, especially in clinical and nursing staff, as well as in administrative and financial systems, to efficiently and effectively respond to the pandemic. another study focusing on the relationship between resource need and case-patients in pandemic influenza scenarios found that the capacity of the private healthcare sector may need to be drawn upon in a timely and effective manner during a pandemic crisis. this study also suggested that provinces with larger probable gaps in resources may require additional support to strengthen response capacity. a third study investigating the capacity of the health system resources in response to pandemic influenza scenarios in the region, which is at high risk for being at the epicenter of the next global pandemic of influenza, highlighted the importance of considering where health system resources in the region might best be positioned and further expanded to respond to more profound pandemic scenarios. the study also emphasized the need to reflect on the capacity of the private healthcare sector during a pandemic crisis and to make explicit planning decisions ahead of the pandemic."
pmc1142358,"this study demonstrates that hcov-nl63, a less pathogenic coronavirus, utilizes the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ace2 , as the highly pathogenic sars-cov. the study reveals that hcov-nl63 infection is more prevalent than infection with another closely related coronavirus, hcov-229e, as virtually all sera from adults potently neutralized hcov-nl63-mediated infection but not 229e-mediated infection. the study suggests that the mode of ace2 engagement by the viral spike  s  proteins impacts viral replication and pathogenesis, as hcov-nl63- and sars-cov-s bind less efficiently to murine ace2 than human ace2. the study highlights the need for efficient vaccines against hcovs, as pathogenic hcovs can evolve, due to the apparent similarities between hcov-nl63 and sars-cov replication and the frequent hcov-nl63 infection of humans. the study suggests that hcov-nl63 and sars-cov-s interactions with ace2 might have important implications for inhibitor development, as the s-ace2 interface is a major target for therapeutic intervention, due to the similarities between hcov-nl63 and sars-cov replication."
pmc5648122,"this study enrolled children with influenza during the winter season, and all the circulating influenza b strains belonged to the b/victoria-lineage within the b/victoria-lineage viruses persistently circulating in humans since the 2009–2010 season, which has not been changed since then. the study found that the prevalence of b influenza virus in italy was 57%, which is not substantially different from that found in some other european countries. among the detected b strains, three were characterized by a different pattern of mutations, and two of them harbored the i97m, k209n, and t258a mutations, while one strain harbored the k56n, v124a, and d526e mutations. these strains belong to two out of three b/brisbane/60/2008 subclades previously described to circulate in australia in 2015. the study revealed that among the detected b strains, four influenza b strains harbored a loss of an important glycosylation site in position 194–196  ha1 , and this finding suggests a possible impact of this loss in the antibody recognition after vaccination. the study's overall analysis of selective pressure within the influenza strains sequenced showed that influenza b evolution could be driven by both positive and negative selection, and this moderate evolution of circulating influenza b strains makes these strains antigenically similar to the vaccine strain, as since the 2009–2010 season, the influenza b vaccine strain, b/brisbane/60/2008, has not been changed. however, based on epidemiological data from this study, it would be more appropriate to use a quadrivalent instead of a trivalent vaccine in italy, as the introduction of this vaccine could prevent or reduce the circulation of both lineages of influenza b and improve the protection of the population against a potential severe disease."
pmc6186045,"next-generation sequencing revealed differentially expressed mrnas, mirnas, and circrnas in tgev-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells, linked to inflammation-related pathways. overexpression of mir-22 reduced p-iκb-α and promoted nuclear accumulation of p65 in tgev-infected cells, while inhibition of mir-22 had the opposite effect. silencing of circrna ssc_circ_009380 inhibited nuclear accumulation of p65 and phosphorylation of iκb-α in tgev-infected cells. mir-22 directly bound to circrna ssc_circ_009380, promoting activation of the nf-κb pathway during tgev-induced inflammation in porcine intestinal epithelial cells. differentially expressed mrnas and ncrnas were primarily enriched in inflammation-related pathways, including nf-κb, tlr, nlr, jak-stat, tnf, and rig-i-like receptor pathways."
pmc4811365,"one approach to attenuating viral vaccines is silent codon modification, which involves introducing synonymous codon substitutions to reduce viral replication rates and thus attenuate viral pathogenicity. this approach has been shown to lead to slow viral replication and reduced virulence in various viruses, such as the influenza virus  mahony et al., 2009 , the human norovirus  kobiezko et al., 2011 , and the respiratory syncytial virus  rsv   chen et al., 2014 . another approach is genome rearrangement or deletion, which involves removing non-essential viral genes or rearranging viral genomes to attenuate viral pathogenicity. this approach has been shown to lead to reduced virulence in the rsv  liu et al., 2013  and human rhinovirus  hrv   chen et al., 2014  viruses. a third approach is the use of chimeric viruses, which involves introducing genes from closely or distantly related viruses to change viral tropism and attenuate viral pathogenicity. this approach has been shown to lead to stable attenuation in the case of the rsv virus  chen et al., 2014 . the use of viral ligase gene deletions has been shown to lead to reduced virulence in the rsv virus  liu et al., 2013 . however, evolutionary recovery is a major challenge to viral vaccine attenuation, as viruses can evolve to reverse attenuating mutations. in the case of silent codon modification, for example, the influenza virus has been shown to recover virulence through compensatory mutations  kobiezko et al., 2011 ."

pmc6815108,"this study presents the first structural and biochemical analyses of sosv-rbp, a recently discovered paramyxovirus protein, revealing insights into its folding, oligomerization, and neuraminidase activity. structural analysis of sosv-rbp, a 6xhis-tagged construct, reveals a novel folding intermediate with an open conformation and a unique dimerization interface distinct from that of other paramyxovirus proteins. biochemical analysis shows that sosv-rbp, like other paramyxovirus neuraminidases, exhibits neuraminidase activity towards sialic acids on glycoproteins and glycolipids, but also displays a distinct substrate specificity towards gangliosides, which may contribute to virulence and pathogenesis in sosv-infected hosts. structural and biochemical analyses also reveal that sosv-rbp has a high affinity for sialic acids on glycoproteins and glycolipids, and that this affinity is not affected by the presence of other paramyxovirus proteins, suggesting that sosv-rbp may have a role in viral attachment and spread in sosv-infected hosts. neuraminidase activity assays and structural studies provide insights into the role of conserved hexapeptide motifs in sosv-rbp oligomerization and neuraminidase activity, which may facilitate the development of specific inhibitors to combat sosv-associated diseases in humans and animals."
pmc2744663,"in this three-country cohort matched on maternal age, gestational age, and number of previous pregnancies, significant differences exist in optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life. women in ghana reported the highest levels of optimism, while chinese women reported the lowest levels of optimism. physical functioning, general health, vitality, and role emotional subscales of the sf-12 also show significant differences by country. women in the us reported the lowest physical functioning and vitality scores, while ghanaian women reported the highest general health and general health scores, and chinese women reported the highest vitality scores. multivariate linear regression analysis identified four key variables that predict approximately 20% of the variance in overall lotr scores  country of origin, working for money, level of education, and ever being treated for emotional issues with medication. the samples differ significantly on several key variables, such as educational attainment and reports of current and previous treatment for emotional issues. the samples were likely very different in terms of standard of living, which may have contributed to the observed differences in optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life. however, income data were missing or uncertain in interpretation, which made meaningful comparisons challenging at best, misleading at worst. the authors suggest that future research needs to address the question of whether the underlying constructs of optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life are conceptualized similarly across cultures. further research is warranted that explores the potential link between psychosocial constructs such as these and measurable health outcomes. only then can researchers and practitioners explore the possibility of interventions to influence what have typically been seen as stable constructs."

pmc6832200,"the recent development of more efficient culture systems for hepacivirus  hcv  has enabled the isolation and propagation of hcv in cell culture systems, providing a platform for studying hcv biology and pathogenesis. hcv is a small, enveloped, positive-stranded rna virus that primarily infects hepatocytes. it is transmitted through contact with infected persons or exposure to contaminated environments. hcv has two distinct virion types  naked and quasi-enveloped particles. the presence of a quasi-envelope, which is derived from lipid rafts, provides the virus with a means of egress from infected cells and aids in its transmission through contact with infected persons or exposure to contaminated environments. naked hepacivirus virions are less efficient at cell entry than quasi-enveloped hepacivirus virions, and their attachment to target cells is less specific. this may provide an explanation for the detection of hepacivus beyond the liver. quasi-enveloped hepacivirus virions use a different mechanism for cell entry than naked hepacivus virions, and the viral membrane is degraded in lysosomes by a process that requires niemann-pick disease type c1 and lysosomal acid lipase. identifying the cellular receptor for both virion types will be key to elucidating their entry mechanisms."

pmc2729920,"a new epidemiological method for assessing the virulence of an emerging infectious disease at the early stage of an epidemic has been proposed. this method adjusts for underestimation due to time delay from onset to death and allows for the estimation of the unbiased confirmed case fatality ratio  ccfr . the proposed method has been applied to the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic in the us and canada, and estimates suggest that the virulence of the novel pandemic strain is comparable to that observed in past influenza pandemics, with the lower bound of the ccfr close to the 0.1% range. the proposed method is particularly useful when there have been only a few deaths or even no death at all by time t during the course of an epidemic. in such situations, uncertainties surrounding the unbiased estimate of ccfr based on a few deaths can partly be addressed by sensitivity analysis of the estimate to different lengths of time from onset to death. given that mean time from onset to death is around 9 days, weekly data do not enable the explicit adjustment of underestimation due to time delay from onset to death. therefore, optimal reporting for surveillance and data sharing should be noted, and rather than updating the data based on date of reporting, it is critically important to summarize the data according to the date of onset both at local and global levels. during the final stages of revision, it came to our attention that an epidemiological study on ccfr of s-oiv with similar techniques and statistical philosophy has been published online, indicating that the preliminary estimate of ccfr for a combination of the us, canada, and mexico is 0.5% and emphasizing a need to accurately capture the cases for the denominator. the proposed method has been applied to the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic in the us and canada, and estimates suggest that the virulence of the novel pandemic strain is comparable to that observed in past influenza pandemics, with the lower bound of the ccfr close to the 0.1% range. however, given that the number of deaths in the us and canada was very small during the early stage, the spike in the biased ccfr during the very beginning of the epidemic may reflect probabilistic variations in the number of"

pmc3323215,"the viral shedding pattern of sars-cov is different from that of other respiratory viruses, with respiratory shedding peaking during the second week and lasting for more than 6 weeks in some cases. stool shedding also occurs later than expected, with the ability to detect virus in stool specimens peaking at the beginning of the second week and remaining high over weeks 3-4. the diagnostic yield of different specimen types varies for sars-cov, with throat washing samples being the most inferior respiratory specimens. pooled throat and nasal swab specimens provide a higher diagnostic yield compared with nasopharyngeal aspirates. a combination of stool sample and pooled throat and nasal swab specimens should be the specimens of choice for a safe and high-yield sars-cov detection. sars-cov can survive for at least 2-4 days at room temperature when mixed with diarrheal or normal stool specimens, and the poor isolation rate from stool may be due to the presence of toxic substances in stool or rectal swab samples or the possibility of viral growth interference due to the presence of immunoglobulin  ig a antibodies. positive virologic results are associated with more adverse outcomes in sars-cov patients, potentially confounded by the fact that only high-yield specimens, such as tracheal aspirate, can be obtained from intubated patients. the ability to accurately diagnose sars-cov infection needs improvement, with options including the inclusion of levels of viremia in the diagnostic algorithm, the development of a sars-cov-specific monoclonal antibody for detecting virus-infected cells from respiratory samples, and the development of an assay to detect viral antigens from stool samples as is available for rotavirus detection. the unusual shedding pattern of sars-cov should also be considered when formulating infection control strategies."
pmc3479418,"this study demonstrates that fmdv, a non-enveloped virus that previously was thought to be unable to activate professional antigen-presenting cells  pdc , can indeed activate pdc, but only in the presence of specific antibodies against the virus. the study shows that both immune-complexed fmdv and uncomplexed fmdv can activate pdc via the toll-like receptor 7  tlr7  pathway. the study reveals that some fmdv isolates are consistently better at inducing pdc to produce interferon-gamma  ifn-γ  than others, and this difference is not related to a cell culture adaptation of certain fmdv isolates to heparin-sulphate binding. the study suggests that the type of antibodies and their specificities is similar for both opsonization and neutralization, as opsonization can occur with serum dilutions similar to those required for neutralization, when antigenically related viruses from the same serotypes are employed. the study highlights that non-neutralizing vaccine-induced antibodies could enhance innate immune responses against antigenically less related fmdv challenge strains and restrict their ability to replicate, potentially limiting virus replication, the severity of clinical diseases, and transmission within the heard."

pmc5853820,"the study found that rapid multiplex testing for a broad panel of respiratory viruses was associated with shorter durations of hospitalization and appropriate management decisions, including the institution of antivirals and a trend toward antibiotic de-escalation in patients with influenza virus positivity. the study also revealed that the ability to detect a wide range of viruses might be more cost-effective and sufficient for the purposes of antimicrobial stewardship in hospitalized adults, as testing only for viruses commonly linked to lower respiratory tract infections was sufficient for this population. however, the study found that rapid testing for a broad array of viruses did not appear, by itself, to be useful for stewardship interventions among hospitalized adult patients, unless it could be combined with additional means of ruling out bacterial coinfections. the study also noted that the ability to detect a wide range of viruses might be critical for immunocompromised patients, as they are at significant risk of bacterial infection. the study found that among patients who did not start empirical therapy before testing and were subsequently found to have a positive rapid multiplex viral test result, they were just as likely as those testing negative for all viruses to start antibiotics within the first 2 days. this finding suggests that physicians can respond to a combination of viral and biomarker data to make appropriate antibiotic management decisions."
pmc4794695,"the study found that the divalent cation required for maximum protein a activity during fhv rna replication is magnesium, as both magnesium and manganese have been implicated in various stages of rna replication in fhv, but manganese can substitute for magnesium during replication initiation and/or dsrna synthesis. the study demonstrated that, while protein a remains enzymatically active, it is unable to initiate subsequent rounds of synthesis using the products detected in the presence of detergent. the study showed that spherules generated during fhv infection are dynamic structures that are likely to be more dynamic than previously thought, at least in fhv, as mitochondria isolated from infected cells no longer show any signs of invaginations and spherules reform following the reinitiation of rna replication. the study suggested that dsrna could play an important role in the maintenance of spherule structure and/or their formation, as swirls of density observed within the spherules represent dsrna and the fact that this density was observed in all the spherules that were imaged suggests that dsrna could play a role in the maintenance of their structure and/or their formation. the study provided an opportunity to visualize spherules by cryo-em in the absence of stains and fixatives, which was of particular interest since all the em studies completed to date have used fixed and sectioned samples, as it eliminates the need for fixation and staining and can achieve resolutions below 5 nm, which should permit more detailed insights into the supramolecular organization of fhv protein a in the membrane, provide clues regarding its orientation and oligomeric state, and identify the structure of viral dsrna inside the spherules."

pmc2045461,"the study revealed that eav nsp1, a replicative polyprotein of the arterivirus family, is a multifunctional protein that participates in several steps of the viral life cycle, including translation of viral rna, replicase polyprotein processing, and sg rna synthesis. the study found that the nsp1 zf domain, a short, independently folded stretch of amino acids that requires the coordination of one or more zinc atoms to stabilize its higher-order structure, is essential for virus production and is involved in virion biogenesis. the study showed that the integrity of the zf domain was also found to be essential for virus production, and three of the mutants  c25h, h27c, and h27a  coupled a deviation of not more than twofold in the ratio of genome to sg mrna synthesis to a 2- to 5-log drop in infectious progeny titers. the study found that, in contrast to the cys-25→a and cys-41/cys-44 mutants, the conservative replacements of cys-25→his and his-27→cys, which in theory maintain the zinc-coordinating potential intact, were largely tolerated in terms of sg rna production, although these mutants were significantly impaired in a later stage of the viral life cycle, possibly virion biogenesis. the study revealed that a role of nsp1 in translation of viral rna also needs to be investigated, although a preliminary analysis did not reveal major deviations in structural protein synthesis for mutants like c25h."
pmc519117,"in bacterial genomes, frameshift signals play a crucial role in the translation of mrna into proteins, as they allow for the decoding of stop codons and the synthesis of proteins with n-terminal methionines. the presence or absence of frameshift signals can also affect the expression level and regulation of genes. the program fsfinder, developed by the authors, is capable of predicting both -1 and +1 frameshift signals in long dna or mrna sequences with increased sensitivity and specificity compared to existing computational models. this is achieved by considering most of known potentially relevant components and by searching both + and - strands, prioritizing candidate signals in the overlapping regions of open reading frames. in borrelia burgdorferi, a well-known example of frameshift signals, fsfinder predicted a cuuugac heptameric sequence in the overlapping region of the orfs in the +1 strand of the genome, which corresponds to a known +1 frameshift site in prfb. it also predicted a new -1 frameshift site in the overlap region. in escherichia coli, a well-known example of frameshift signals, fsfinder missed 11 frameshift sites in 38 bacterial genomes with rf2 genes from genbank since their slippery sequences were of the form cuu ura c. however, on average, fsfinder detected no -1 frameshift sites and 0.9 +1 frameshift sites in the overlapping regions of open reading frames. biochemical experiments are currently underway to confirm the predictions made by fsfinder in borrelia burgdorferi. this highlights the importance of fully understanding the underlying mechanisms and discovering new genes associated with frameshift signals. however, frameshift signals are diverse and organism-dependent, so fsfinder will be extended in the future to find any frameshift site modeled by the user."
pmc4828211,"the virus-cell attachment assay described in the protocol is sensitive and can reliably detect attachment over a large dynamic range, requiring as little as 20 pfu  moi of ~0.0004 in a 48-well plate  and can accurately measure productive binding events by standard infectious virus due to its extreme sensitivity. the qpcr-based method described in the protocol can be used over a large dynamic range of copy numbers  e.g., from 0.0004 to at least 40  due to its high sensitivity, significantly reducing the quantity of virus needed for the assay and limiting additional handling steps that may impact the quality of virions being used in the assay. the modified assay, which can measure additional stages of viral entry including viral particle endocytosis and the final step of virus fusion, can be performed by following the steps of the attachment protocol through step 2.5, which is attachment of particles to cells at 4°c, and then warming the cells to allow viral particles to be endocytosed or measuring genome uncoating following fusion of viral and endosomal membranes. the protocol described can be easily modified to study virus attachment, endocytosis, or fusion for other viruses provided the rt-pcr reagents are tailored to the new virus of interest, as demonstrated in previous studies."

pmc6466141,"the grna of  + ssrna viruses is not packaged by chance, but rather by a specific set of factors that are specific to each virus. the ability of an rna to be replicated by the rdrp is a key factor that determines if this molecule can be packaged. in some viruses, the presence of a packaging signal  ps  is not sufficient to explain selective packaging, as the ability of the rna to be replicated is also involved. other characteristics that may determine how an rna is packaged include whether rna replication produces other rna species aside from the grna, the length and number of packaged molecules, and the nature of the host cell. the molecular mechanism that controls selective packaging in  + ssrna viruses is very complex and depends on a series of interactions and characteristics that are specific to each species. there are instances in which some of these characteristics can be shared among viruses that belong to the same genus or family, or even between unrelated viruses. the specific details of these molecular mechanisms can differ greatly even between species that are evolutionarily very close to each other. viruses can solve the same problem by using very different solutions. the lack of knowledge of all the interactions that control packaging of the grna has led us to neglect this process as a possible target for antiviral therapies. only a deep and comprehensive understanding of the similarities and differences between these processes among different viruses will allow us to develop novel therapies aimed at one of the most crucial steps of the viral infectious cycle."
pmc3538156,"the study identified a virus in 59.3% of the participants, with rsv being the most common virus among lrti patients using rt-rt-pcr, dfa, and svc. the study demonstrated that hadv, detected in 18.5%, is the second most common causative viral agent for lrti. the study confirmed that rsv is successfully isolated using the r-mix™ system, which has a low sensitivity for hadv detection compared to rt-rt-pcr. the study showed that hadv, rsv, and hpiv-1 were the most commonly detected viruses in this study, which is consistent with results using other studies worldwide. the study revealed that virus isolation-based methods such as svc and dfa have lower sensitivity for virus detection compared to rt-rt-pcr, particularly after the first three days post-onset of symptoms, when viral titers decrease over the course of infection."

pmc1253587,"the study identified a new epitope on the gp41 envelope protein of hiv that is targeted by a human antibody, called d5-igg1, which inhibits viral entry into cells. the epitope is located in a hydrophobic pocket in the inner coil of the gp41 prehairpin intermediate, which is a conserved region across different hiv subtypes and isolates. the study showed that mutations in the amino acids lining this pocket, which are critical for viral fusion, confer resistance to neutralization by d5-igg1. the study also found that the d5-igg1 antibody inhibits the infectivity of a diverse range of hiv isolates, including viruses from different subtypes and viruses with reduced sensitivity to other entry inhibitors such as t20 and the broadly neutralizing antibodies igg1b12 and 2f5. the study suggested that the hydrophobic pocket in the inner coil of the gp41 prehairpin intermediate qualifies as a ""hot spot"" for fusion inhibition and represents a conserved epitope that is targeted by a variety of protein-protein interactions, including peptide and peptidomimetic fusion inhibitors. the study also found that the peptide entry inhibitor t20 neutralized all of the 19 viruses tested, whereas d5-igg1, despite inhibiting viral fusion by a t20-like mechanism and targeting a conserved epitope, was less potent than the broadly neutralizing antibodies igg1b12, 2f5, and 4e10. the study suggested that the ability of d5-igg1 to inhibit hiv infection probably derives from its ability to bind a physiologically relevant epitope with high affinity, and therefore, the identification of this new neutralizing epitope provides new hope for hiv vaccine designs aimed at eliciting neutralizing antibodies. the study showed that both structures of the synthetic antigens, izn36 and 5h, have repeatedly elicited high-titer nonneutralizing antibodies in experimental animals, including rhesus macaques, but"
pmc2045495,"the study identifies a new family of deubiquitinating enzymes, termed herpesvirus tegument usps  htusps , which are conserved in all herpesvirus subfamilies. the htusp domain is located at the n-terminal end of large tegument proteins, and its conservation suggests an important function for this activity. the study reveals that the herpesvirus-encoded htusp is necessary and sufficient to confer activity and specificity toward ub-based substrates, while the carboxy-terminal sequence of vp1/2 tegument protein, which is essential in pseudorabies virus, is dispensable. the study shows that orf64usp, the mhv-68-encoded htusp, covalently binds ubvme and less efficiently binds nedd8-vme, but it hydrolyzes ub-amc, but not nedd8-amc, and the accumulation of the covalent adducts of orf64usp with nedd8-vme is irreversible. the study suggests that the biological role of the herpesvirus usps will require the identification of their natural substrates, and the ability to generate mutants of herpesviruses that lack this activity may help attain this goal."
pmc1811125,"in a study on the role of interleukin-13  il-13  in respiratory syncytial virus  rsv  infection, the authors found that overexpression of il-13 reduced viral titers, diminished lung interferon gamma  ifn-γ  production, and protected against rsv-induced weight loss. in contrast, mice deficient in il-13 had higher viral titers and increased lung ifn-γ production. administration of a neutralizing antibody against il-13 in mice infected with rsv resulted in reduced viral antigen levels in lung homogenates, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  elisa  specific for rsv proteins, but the authors did not measure viral titers or lung ifn-γ production in these experiments. the authors also found that il-13 served a protective role during rsv infection in both il-13-overexpressing mice and mice treated with a neutralizing antibody against il-13, and that il-13 deficiency increased viral titers and lung ifn-γ production. the authors noted that il-13 and il-4 induced similar biological functions, as both trigger the janus kinase  jak -stat signaling pathway through the shared il-4rα chain of their receptors. however, the authors also found that il-4 has been shown to increase the virulence of poxvirus infection and is associated with a reduction in cytotoxic t lymphocyte  ctl  precursor frequency, while il-13 has been shown to protect against rsv-induced weight loss and does not alter the frequency of ifn-γ-producing ctl. the authors noted that il-13 overexpression in il-13-overexpressing mice increased surfactant proteins  sp -a, -b, and -c two-fold, and sp-d was increased 70-fold over levels found in non-transgenic littermates, but deficiency of il-13 did not alter either sp-a or sp-d levels in balb/c mice. the authors also noted that il-13 overexpression reduced viral tit"

pmc149775,"in the context of the study on coronavirus, the authors discovered that the envelope protein m of middle east respiratory syndrome  mers  coronavirus interacts specifically and selectively with a viral cis-acting rna element called the ps, independently of the nucleocapsid protein n, during viral genome packaging into virus-like particles  vlps . this finding challenges the current understanding that n protein binds to all mers coronavirus mrnas, including the ps, in infected cells and suggests a novel paradigm for viral genome packaging, in which the selective interaction of m protein with ps determines the exclusivity of viral rna packaging into vlps, in the absence of n protein. the authors showed that mers coronavirus nonstructural proteins are not necessary for rna packaging into vlps, as mers coronavirus vlps were produced in cells coexpressing the synthetic mers coronavirus di rna containing the ps and all four  m, n, s, and e  mers coronavirus structural proteins, despite the lack of any mers coronavirus ps sequences. this finding challenges the current understanding that viral rnas are randomly incorporated into vlps in other expression systems and suggests an absolutely specific and selective nucleocapsid-independent rna packaging mechanism in mers coronavirus. the authors demonstrated that mers coronavirus vlps produced in cells coexpressing mers coronavirus rna containing the ps and m and e proteins were indistinguishable from authentic mers coronavirus vlps in terms of their morphology, size, and buoyant density, and contained the ps-containing rna transcripts selectively and exclusively, in the absence of n protein. the authors proposed a model to elucidate the mechanism of rna packaging in mers coronavirus based on their findings and other studies, which suggests that m protein, which accumulates and probably oligomerizes in the intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi complex, binds specifically to the ps present in mrna 1, determines the selective genomic rna packaging, and excludes the packaging of mers coronavirus subgenomic mrnas lacking the ps. n protein, which is associated with mrna 1, interacts with"

pmc4006447,"the most important finding regarding the m1058l substitution in the fcov s protein is that it does not correlate with fip disease phenotype, as previously proposed by chang et al.  2013 . the study found that a significant number  9%  of tissue samples that did not show the m1058l substitution still encoded the s1060a substitution, suggesting that changes in the fusogenic activity of the fcov s protein, including but not limited to these substitutions, could be representative of a class of mutations that influence the pathogenesis of fip  13 . the study found that a far greater proportion  81%  of faecal samples from cats with fip were fcov qrt-pcr positive, and their relative copy numbers were significantly higher than those of faecal samples from cats without fip. this suggests that these cats were shedding an enteric form of the virus, and potentially, a systemic form of the virus as well, as a smaller but significant proportion  23%  of faecal samples from cats with fip provided fcov rna samples encoding leucine at position 1058  13 . the study also found that a larger number  77%  of faecal samples from cats without fip encoded methionine at position 1058, indicative of infection with the enteric form of the virus  13 . the study identified that a mixed population of rnas encoding for either methionine or leucine at position 1058 was present in a single tissue sample taken from a cat without fip  cat 60 . this suggests that the m1058l substitution in the faecal sample was a relatively recent event, and the virus had not yet spread systemically  13 . the study demonstrated that the pyrosequencing approach is a rapid and accurate method to identify single nucleotide differences at a specific position within a dna fragment, or in this case, a viral genome  13 . however, it has some limitations, as some samples required 50 cycles of pcr amplification to generate adequate amounts of dna for sequencing, and some samples did not produce sufficient pcr products for pyrosequencing, even after 50 amplification"
pmc5014060,"the study found that estimates of the basic reproduction number, r0, based on ignoring contact structure in actual social structures tend to result in a slight overestimation in epidemics on empirical networks. this is consistent with observations made in previous studies on epidemics in actual social structures and on empirical networks. the study also found that estimates of r0 based on homogeneous mixing assumption tend to be larger than estimates based on who infected whom in the real infection process in epidemics on empirical networks. this is explained by the relatively small average number of acquaintances per individual and the structure of small groups in which all individuals are acquaintances with all other individuals in the group in some actual social structures. the study further found that estimates of r0 based on homogeneous mixing assumption tend to be less than 90% of estimates based on who infected whom in epidemics on empirical networks. this is consistent with observations made in previous studies on epidemics on empirical networks. half of the estimates of r0 based on the epidemic growth rate and the homogeneous mixing assumption are between 12% and 45% larger than the estimate based on who infected whom in epidemics on empirical networks. the difference in estimates of r0 based on the epidemic growth rate and the homogeneous mixing assumption tends to be less than 21 in some empirical networks. this is consistent with observations made in previous studies on epidemics on empirical networks. the study also found that if the infection rate is increasing, the overestimation factor also shows an increasing trend in epidemics on empirical networks. this is consistent with observations made in previous studies on epidemics on actual social structures and on empirical networks. the study further found that in some epidemics on empirical networks, the majority of estimates of r0 based on the epidemic growth rate and the homogeneous mixing assumption are between 12% and 45% larger than the estimate based on who infected whom. the study also found that in some epidemics on empirical networks, the difference in estimates of r0 based on the epidemic growth rate and the homogeneous mixing assumption tends to be less than 21. the study further found that in some epidemics on empirical networks, the majority of"
pmc5997359,"the study identified multiple co-infections with arboviruses in patients in haiti during the chikungunya epidemic, including co-infections with chikungunya virus and zika virus, as well as co-infections with chikungunya virus and mayaro virus. the study also found a high genomic similarity of a haitian mayaro virus isolate with a brazilian strain isolated in 1960, suggesting that mayaro virus has been circulating in the human population at a sub-epidemic level, most likely in brazil, for years and that it was introduced just recently onto hispaniola. the study found that the strains of chikungunya, zika, and mayaro viruses identified in haiti during the chikungunya epidemic did not cluster with the viruses previously obtained in haiti in 2014 and 2016, indicating multiple independent introductions of these arboviruses in haiti between 2014 and 2016. the study's phylogenetic analysis suggested that the introduction of zika virus in haiti happened between 2008 and 2014, a time interval again overlapping with the estimated introduction of both chikungunya and mayaro viruses co-infecting strains circulating in haiti inferred from the phylogenies. the study's phylogenetic analysis also indicated that the strains of chikungunya and zika viruses found in patients in haiti during the chikungunya epidemic did not cluster with the viruses previously obtained in florida in 2016, as well as the multiple independent introductions of chikungunya, zika, and mayaro viruses to haiti inferred from the phylogenies, demonstrating the potential role of the caribbean as a node for arbovirus infections connecting south, central, and north america. the study's molecular clock analysis suggested that the median origin of the chikungunya co-infection strains was estimated to be april 2014, with 95% highest posterior density between january 2013 and january 20"
pmc5701476,"human coronavirus strain 229e  hcov-229e , commonly causing the common cold, is increasingly linked to more severe respiratory infections in vulnerable populations. the virus has neuroinvasive and neurotropic properties and has been isolated from clinical samples, but primarily from respiratory specimens. during a suspected arbovirus outbreak in haiti, hcov-229e and human alphaherpesvirus 1 were isolated from a child's plasma, making it the first reported isolation from human plasma. whole-genome sequencing revealed that the haitian hcov-229e isolate is closely related to american strains reported in 2015, but with unique nucleotide polymorphisms affecting polyprotein 1ab, spike, accessory, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins. the study's findings highlight the potential for hcov-229e to cause severe respiratory infections, particularly in vulnerable populations, and the need for further research on the virus's pathogenesis and potential treatments."
pmc5172413,"the study reports the rapid cloning and purification of the nc protein fragment from yeast cells, which demonstrates highly specific immuno-response in sera from sars patients. the elisa analysis of the nc fusion protein shows that it can specifically distinguish sars patient sera from those of normal controls, providing a potential diagnostic tool for sars. the study suggests that the n protein fragment may be of great potential in designing clinical diagnostic tools for sars due to its highly specific immuno-response in sars patient sera. the n protein fragment may become a candidate for a vaccine against sars due to its highly specific immuno-response in sars patient sera. the study highlights the potential advantages of using the nc protein fragment for designing diagnostic tools and vaccines against sars, such as the simplified cloning procedures, the preservation of posttranslational modifications, and the ability to overcome potential issues with whole virus lysates in large-scale production of antigens and vaccines."
pmc3203390,"in this population-based study, variants in the rfc1, scn1a, and anpep genes were identified as potentially implicated in susceptibility to severe west nile virus disease. the association between a variant in rfc1 and severe disease was confirmed in a replication cohort, while variants in scn1a and anpep did not replicate. the study highlights the importance of conducting human population-based studies, as it found no evidence of an effect of the 32-bp deletion in ccr5 on clinical symptoms, in contrast to a previously reported association. the study identified no significant effects of variants in the oas gene cluster or tlr3 on west nile virus disease. the study found no evidence of any systematic differences in phenotype data, including adjustment for ancestry informative markers, to explain the lack of replication for a variant in rfc1. the study identified no association between any of the oas polymorphisms and west nile virus, highlighting the importance of conducting human population-based studies."
pmc2741444,"increased atp generation is required for efficient vaccinia virus  vv  production, and this is achieved through up-regulation of genes involved in atp production. up-regulation of genes involved in atp production occurs after viral dna replication, as treatment with apigenin and ara c reduces the up-regulation of nd4 expression and the increase in atp generation. increased atp generation is a bcl-2 independent event, as the amount of bcl-2 protein in the host cell does not increase after vv infection. vv n1l protein, which has similar secondary structure as bcl-2 protein, does not influence atp levels in vivo, as neither nd4 nor coii gene was up-regulated by n1l protein. up-regulation of genes involved in atp production occurs after viral dna replication, as these findings are consistent with the observation that neither nd4 nor coii gene was up-regulated by n1l protein, which is an early gene product."
pmc3731008,"during the two-year study in khanh hoa province, vietnam, over 57% of the 1541 specimens tested by locally trained vietnamese scientists were found to be positive for at least one virus, with influenza viruses, most commonly the pandemic strain a h1n1 pdm09, being the most commonly detected. the study also revealed that the pandemic strain a h1n1 pdm09 quickly replaced an established outbreak of a h3n2  in 2009 in central vietnam, as observed in other geographical locations. the study found that enterovirus circulation was restricted to the dry season in both study years, whereas rhinovirus and adenovirus circulated throughout the year, with the latter often associated with co-infections, making their clinical significance unclear. the study showed that the circulation and morbidity associated with common viruses, such as influenza and less common viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and coronaviruses, had a wide age demographic, as the intervention of the pandemic strain a h1n1 pdm09 hampered the efforts to comprehensively study the seasonality of respiratory viruses in this region of vietnam because the scale of the outbreak minimized the likelihood of detecting other circulating respiratory viruses. the study also highlighted the important role of enteroviruses in respiratory disease, as suspected cases appeared to have been admitted as a precaution while information on the clinical severity of this novel strain was gathered over time. the study also revealed the importance of coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses in respiratory disease, as they circulated throughout the year, with the exception of enterovirus, which circulated only in the dry season in both study years."
pmc3709686,"in this study, reverse genetics was used to generate mutant forms of the glycoprotein  gp  of the filovirus ebola virus  ebov  that could not be cleaved by furin, a key host cell factor for ebov gp entry. this was achieved by introducing mutations at amino acid residues 435 and 436, which are critical for furin cleavage, into the gp gene of ebov. the mutant gps were expressed in the context of a replication-competent chimeric virus  rcsfv  and tested for their ability to replicate in cell culture. one of the mutant gps was found to be able to replicate, indicating that furin-independent entry is possible for ebov. in another context, monoclonal antibodies  mabs  were used to detect the presence of gp in virus-infected cells. the binding activities of these mabs to gp were tested in the context of a different virus, marburg virus  marv . mutant gps with a deletion or insertion in the gp gene were generated and tested for their ability to bind the mabs. in a third context, the binding of mabs to gp was tested in the context of ebov gp mutants. mutant gps with mutations at amino acid residues 435 and 436, which are critical for furin cleavage, were generated and tested for their ability to bind the mabs. these mutant gps were found to be able to bind the mabs, indicating that the mabs can recognize gp even in the context of mutant gps. in another study, the binding of mabs to gp was tested in the context of ebov gp mutants. mutant gps with mutations at amino acid residues 435 and 436, which are critical for furin cleavage, were generated and tested for their ability to bind the mabs. these mutant gps were found to be able to bind the mabs, indicating that the mabs can recognize gp even in the context of mutant gps. in addition, mutant gps with mutations at amino acid residues 411"
pmc6297417,"in a study of 1,332 patients with influenza pneumonia, m. pneumoniae coinfection was associated with the age of 5-10 years and clinically indistinguishable from influenza pneumonia without the coinfection. low wbc count and crp concentration in influenza pneumonia may hinder distinguishing between influenza pneumonia with and without the coinfection. m. pneumoniae testing should be performed to optimize antibiotic therapy in the setting of the coinfection, as macrolides were given more frequently to patients with the coinfection without a delay. prompt m. pneumoniae testing could contribute to early detection of the coinfection in influenza pneumonia, especially in patients aged 5-10 years who are at relatively low risk for influenza pneumonia. the current guidelines for pediatric cap, which recommend macrolides as empirical antibiotics only in cases of presumed atypical pneumonia, can lead to omission of macrolide therapy in patients with the coinfection."
pmc3936264,"in the context of healthcare, a study investigating the congruence between crowdsourced information and official government data in south korea found that the quality of crowdsourced information on healthcare services varies across regions and can be explained by geospecific demographic factors such as birthrate, educational attainment, population density, and the number of doctors per clinic. this study suggests that governmental efforts should be made to counterbalance the misinformation by disseminating approval ratings of pediatric clinics via geospecific online health communities, especially in regions with the lowest information quality levels. in the context of finance, a study analyzing the returns of investing in small-cap stocks in south korea during a bull market found that the stock price momentum effect, which refers to the tendency of stocks with high past returns to continue to outperform stocks with low past returns, becomes weaker in the presence of high levels of uncertainty. this finding has practical implications for portfolio managers who should be aware of the potential reversal of the stock price momentum effect in times of high uncertainty, such as during a bear market or in response to a major economic shock. in the context of education, a study exploring the effects of teacher feedback on student learning in singapore found that students who received more frequent and more specific teacher feedback demonstrated greater improvement in their learning outcomes compared to students who received less frequent and less specific feedback. this finding has implications for teachers and educators who should aim to provide more frequent and specific feedback to their students to maximize their learning outcomes. in the context of marketing, a study examining the effects of social media use on consumer decision-making found that consumers who frequently use social media during their decision-making process are more likely to make impulsive purchases and are less sensitive to price discounts compared to consumers who less frequently use social media. this finding has practical implications for marketers who should be aware of the potential impact of social media use on consumer behavior and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly. in the context of psychology, a study investigating the relationship between social media use and self-esteem found that individuals who spend more time on social media tend to report lower levels of self-esteem, possibly due to the potential negative effects of social comparison and social comparison anxiety. this finding has implications for individuals who should be aware of the potential negative effects of excessive social media use on self-esteem and take steps to limit their social media"
pmc3607795,"rna recombination is a major driving force for rna virus diversity, facilitating the emergence and evolution of new viral strains and variants. rna recombination is a byproduct of rna genome organization, acting on selected aspects of the virus life cycle and not necessarily favored by natural selection. rna recombination is a key function during virus speciation and emergence, but its shared contribution that parallels other rna modification pathways has not yet been assessed. rna viruses can recombine with cellular rnas, but the factors and mechanisms enabling such events, as well as the intracellular location of the rna-rna template switching, are not well understood. rna viruses were found to recombine with cellular rnas, but the exact steps and molecular mechanisms of the rna viral sequence integration with the cellular dna have not been fully elucidated."
pmc6759245,"the study involved 14 laboratories from around the world and included a panel of 29 serum samples from patients with confirmed mers-cov infection. all laboratories correctly identified the negative samples, including those containing antibodies against other coronaviruses, implying good specificity of the assays. the use of a reference material in the assays reduced the variation in results between laboratories and improved comparability of the data. the study highlighted the importance of understanding whether there is a specific window of time in which clinical samples for serology should be taken or whether some patients do not mount a detectable antibody response against the spike protein during infection. the study demonstrated the importance of using a standard for mers-cov serology to allow better comparison of results from different laboratories or interpretation of results from different studies or clinical trials."
pmc6521621,"viral envelope proteins, such as hiv-1 env, are targeted by multiple antiviral factors to restrict virus entry and spread. these factors include restriction factors that impair virus infectivity, such as tetherin and serinc5, as well as factors that alter glycosylation or cleavage of env, such as fut2 and vpr. viral envelope proteins also face pressure from innate and adaptive immune responses, which can drive viral evolution and adaptation. some viruses, such as ebola and marburg, have also been found to use their envelope glycoproteins to antagonize tetherin and other restriction factors. understanding the mechanisms by which these factors restrict virus entry and spread, as well as the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses, may lead to new approaches for treating and even curing viral infections, as demonstrated by the use of trim5α in gene therapy to create hiv-resistant hematopoietic stem cells."

pmc3791787,"the study identified three distinct hepatitis b virus  hbv  species in bats, which share high sequence similarity in key domains required for infection and host tropism. the bat hbv species tupaiid hepatitis b virus  thbv  has a zoonotic potential for humans, as it can infect human hepatoma cells and its surface proteins can mediate infection in a similar manner to hbv. the study found evidence for a zoonotic potential for thbv, as it is capable of infecting human hepatoma cells and is not neutralized by high-titered anti-hbs antibodies from vaccinated individuals, similar to the occasional failure of the standard hbv vaccine against heterologous human hbv genotypes. the study highlights the need for screening of human and nonhuman primate sera from remote tropical areas for bat-associated hepatitis b viruses, as bats can adapt to anthropogenic influence and impose an ongoing risk of zoonotic human infections. the study suggests that future vaccination concepts against hbv may need to integrate considerations of the zoonotic potential of primate and nonprimate hepatitis b viruses, as the genetic distance between bat hbv species and hbv may go undetected in routine serological and molecular screening programs."
pmc6399434,"direct detection tests for early active infection in lyme disease are technically achievable due to advancements in molecular and genomic technologies. pcr strategies have shown promise in detecting low abundances of borrelia burgdorferi in blood, as well as in other studies with sensitivities increased by combining multiple consecutive methods. nucleic acid amplification tests  naats  have shown success in detecting causative agents of sepsis and ebola with sensitivities increased by combining multiple consecutive methods. challenges remain, including our incomplete knowledge of the full breadth of borrelia genomic diversity and the need for cost-benefit factors and attention to the risk of exogenous contamination and degradation of nucleic acid during transport to the laboratory. continued reliance on serologic testing for early lyme disease is suboptimal due to the common 2-3 week seronegative window with current methods and the need for a biomarker of active infection. direct tests for borrelia burgdorferi infection, including nucleic acid and protein detections, would complement improving indirect serological tests for more comprehensive diagnosis of lyme disease."
pmc2700284,"the study demonstrates that acquisition and enhancement of the cell-cell fusion activity by amino acid substitutions in the s protein are critical for interspecies adaptation and infectivity of ibv to cultured mammalian cells. the study shows that the l857-f mutation in the s2 region of the ibv s protein confers the s protein from non-fusogenic to fusogenic, and this mutation may affect one of the fusion steps and thus modify the fusion activity of s protein and syncytia formation. the study illustrates that acquisition and enhancement of virus-cell/cell-cell membrane fusion is a multistep process, and it involves binding of the s protein to one or more receptors, conformational changes of the protein to a fusion-active form, and the actual fusion process. the study demonstrates that further enhancement of the cell-cell fusion activity of ibv s protein was achieved by a single amino acid substitution  g405-d  in p65 virus, and this mutation, meanwhile, enhances the infectivity of the virus in cultured cells. the study proposes a model of two-step adaptation adaptation process of two-step adaptation of chicken embryo-adapted ibv to vero cells, and it divides early passages of vero-adapted ibv, including p7, p12, p14, and p20, belong to the primarily adapted group, and other cell culture-adapted strains, including the ck-adapted and beaudette-us strains cac39114 and cac39300, belong to the secondarily adapted group."

pmc3888147,"the study found a statistically significant association between lower serum 25 oh d levels and increased risk of laboratory-confirmed viral upper respiratory tract infections in children and adolescents from hutterite communities in canada. lower serum 25 oh d levels were associated with increased risk of viral upper respiratory tract infections after adjusting for age and sex. younger age was also associated with increased risk of viral upper respiratory tract infections. the study suggests that higher serum 25 oh d levels may be needed for prevention of viral upper respiratory tract infections, as lower levels were associated with increased risk. the study provides evidence in support of future interventional trials examining the efficacy of vitamin d supplementation on viral upper respiratory tract infections in children and adolescents."
pmc6396908,"the study reports the development of a di-244 variant encoding a fluorescent protein, which allows monitoring of dip production in cell culture. this is important as previous dip preparations were produced in the presence of standard virus or in hen's eggs, requiring subsequent inactivation of the virus. the study demonstrates that cells stably expressing pb2 allow the production and quantification of di-244 particles solely from plasmids and in the absence of standard virus. this is significant as it overcomes the technical challenges associated with controlling the efficiency of uv inactivation of standard virus and interpreting experimental data and animal trials. the study shows that the availability of a di-244 variant encoding a fluorescent protein allows the quantification of dip infectivity using a standard technique, focus formation assay. this is crucial as it provides a method to compare results obtained with different di-244 preparations or other segment 1 dips and to determine whether sufficient numbers of dips can be delivered to the human respiratory tract and remain stable to provide protection against influenza for a prolonged time. the study confirms that dip-mediated inhibition of ibv infection in cell culture is not observed due to absence of genome competition, but it suggests that dip-generated inhibition of spread of diverse iav subtypes in cell culture is comparable to that of di-244 generated by use of standard virus, demonstrating that dips produced in pb2 expressing cells are fully functional. the study shows that di-244 particles and other segment 1 dips have to be provided in vast excess to exert antiviral activity, as reassortment of dips with iav in coinfected cells is likely to occur. this finding matches data published for di-244 generated by use of standard virus and demonstrates that dips produced in pb2 expressing cells are fully functional, although the activity of purified dips remains to be examined."
pmc6466025,"autophagy is activated during ablv infection in bat cells, and pharmacological activation of autophagy with rapamycin or bezabial reduces ablv replication. black flying fox cells have a higher basal rate of autophagy compared to human cells, and autophagy serves as both an anti-viral and pro-survival mechanism in bat cells. ablv infection increases autophagosome generation and autophagy in black flying fox and human cells, and autophagy activation in black flying fox cells is dependent on a high ablv moi. autophagy activation with rapamycin or bezabial reduces wt-ablv replication in both black flying fox and human cell lines, suggesting autophagy antagonizes lyssavirus infection. black flying fox cells maintain a higher basal rate of mitophagy, which serves as a secondary anti-viral role for autophagy in bats, as postulated by brook and dobson, 2015."

pmc3906895,"this exploratory digital epidemiologic study provides evidence that internet surveillance is a rapid and efficient way to evaluate public reactions during the study period of a public health emergency, as it allows for real-time monitoring, which can be timely to know public reactions to the outbreak because it is a real-time surveillance during the emergencies and also it is very economical without consuming too many resources. the indexes of public reaction, daily posted and forwarded number and bai, to h7n9 outbreaks, were significantly higher in 7 provinces/cities with human h7n9 cases than those in 2 provinces without cases, and both daily posted and forwarded number and bai were positively associated with the cumulative case fatality rate of human h7n9 infection, indicating that the first 3 days of the outbreak was the period when internet attentions rose rapidly, and the high public attention would last for a week, which is a good time for the department of emergency control and prevention to disseminate health education knowledge and skills through network and social media. this study showed that the public reaction was positively associated with the cumulative case fatality rate but not daily number of cases, and when the case fatality rate was high, the public attention was high, and the public attention decreased with a decrease in case fatality rate, indicating that the public attention decreases when the threat from the epidemic disease decreases. this study showed that rumors generate and occur early during the period of public health emergency, and most of the rumors claimed that h7n9 avian influenza cases occurred in the local areas, indicating that the uncertainty of emerging infectious diseases often generates the rumors, and it also suggests the importance of early information release. this study showed that when there were new cases reported in a new province/city, the daily posted and forwarded number and bai increased significantly, especially in the local province/city, indicating that the extension of epidemic area triggered more public attention than the increase of reported cases in the original outbreak areas, and it implies that extra methods should be taken when the epidemic area is expanded."

pmc2806912,"the human lung has two main epithelial cell types  non-ciliated cells and ciliated cells. the former is more susceptible to human influenza virus infection, while the latter is more permissive to avian influenza virus infection. influenza virus infection induces a complex set of innate host responses, including cytokine and chemokine release, which play a critical role in host defense and pathogenesis. the distribution of sialic acid receptors on the cell surface of bronchial epithelial cells is a major determinant of the permissiveness of these cells to influenza virus infection. the human seasonal influenza virus  h3n2  preferentially infects non-ciliated cells, while the avian influenza virus  h5n1  infects ciliated cells. this differential tropism is associated with the localization of sialic acid receptors on these cell types. the expression of sialic acid receptors on bronchial epithelial cells has a major impact on the permissiveness of these cells to influenza virus replication and on the host responses elicited by such infection. this highlights the importance of using physiologically relevant models for the understanding of influenza virus pathogenesis."

pmc7019308,"the study successfully isolated and characterized the pdcov chn-js-2017 strain in cultured cells and demonstrated its pathogenicity in piglets. the study found that the expression of fcrn and pigr in the intestinal mucosa of infected piglets is down-regulated by nf-κb and positively correlated with each other in infected piglets. the study revealed that the prevalence of pdcov in pigs is high in certain provinces in china, with a success rate of isolation in cultured cells being relatively low. the study suggests that pdcov causes severe diarrhea and vomiting in piglets aged 5-21 days and that viral fecal shedding can be detected through real-time pcr in fecal swabs from challenged piglets. the study provides insights into the immune escape strategy of pdcov, as it significantly down-regulated fcrn and pigr expression by nf-κb and reduces the ability of fcrn and pigr to transport pdcov-specific igg and iga across the mucosal epithelium, resulting in impaired intestinal immunity in the mucosa and reducing the host’s anti-infection ability."
pmc2812394,"deletion mutants of tgev n protein were designed based on predicted domain distribution, order-disorder pattern, and rna-binding residues. nucleic acid binding of n protein mutants was evaluated using northwestern blotting, showing that mutants lacking the c-terminal domain had reduced rna binding, while mutants containing the central disorder domain had rna binding activity similar to or greater than full-length n protein. in vitro template switching assay using a hiv-derived system revealed that tgev n protein acts as an rna chaperone, facilitating template switching. in vivo analysis using tgev-derived replicons showed that n protein is required for efficient transcription, and the central disordered domain  aa 117 to 268  of n protein contains rna chaperone activity. the rna chaperone activity of tgev n protein was located in its central disordered domain, and this activity requires rna binding and additional characteristics present in the δn3 n-protein fragment."

pmc2990753,"during previous disease outbreaks, such as the sars epidemic, a significant proportion of healthcare workers  hcws  experienced frequent concerns regarding their health and their families' health, high levels of psychological distress, worries about their functional ability, and fears of stigmatization. in september 2009, during the a/h1n1 pandemic, more than half of hcws experienced moderately high levels of worry about the pandemic, with auxiliary staff presenting the highest degree of worry and nurses being more worried than medical staff. the most frequent concern was for infection of family and friends and the consequences of the disease on their health. few hcws  6.6%  had restricted their social contacts, and fewer  3.8%  felt isolated by their family members and friends because of their hospital work, while a low percentage  4.3%  would take a leave to avoid infection. most hcws considered that it was not possible to avoid their duties in an emergency situation due to the pandemic and they would continue working despite the potential risks. perceived sufficiency of information about several aspects of the a/h1n1 influenza was moderately high, while perceived sufficiency of information about the a/h1n1 influenza prognosis was independently associated with reduced degree of worry. hospital managers and consultation-liaison psychiatry services should try to provide for hcws' information needs, if we are to offer favourable working conditions in times of extreme distress, such as the current and future pandemics."
pmc4462628,"the study found that the cysteine protease cathepsin w  ctsw  is required for the fusion of the influenza a virus  iav  with host cells. this was shown through several experiments, including the observation that iav entry into cells was reduced by 90% in the presence of the ctsw inhibitor e64, and that iav fusion with host cells was significantly impaired in cells lacking ctsw expression. the study also found that ctsw is essential for the fusion of iav strains with a high fusion phenotype, but not for another late fusing virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus  lcmv . the study showed that ctsw is required for the entrapment of iav nucleoprotein  np  in late endosomes, as the np was found to be trapped in late endosomes in the presence of ctsw inhibitor or ctsw knockdown, but not in the presence of ctsw overexpression. the study found that ctsw overexpression did not affect iav replication, as shown by the determination of viral titers in cells stably expressing ctsw or ctsw c153a  and infected with iav. the study also demonstrated that ctsw is required for the maturation of iav in late endosomes, as the iav ha0 and ha1 proteins were found to be processed in the presence of ctsw inhibitor or ctsw knockdown, but not in the presence of ctsw overexpression. the study further showed that ctsw is essential for the maturation of iav ha2 and ha3 proteins, as the ha2 and ha3 bands were not observed in the presence of ctsw inhibitor or ctsw knockdown, but were present in the presence of ctsw overexpression. the study found that ctsw-overexpressing cells were more susceptible to iav infection, as shown by the observation that iav entry into cells was increased by 200% in the presence of ctsw overexpression. the study also revealed that the ctsw inhibitor e64 did not affect the entry of i"

pmc5587821,"the powerchek mers assay, developed by kogene biotech, has been approved by the china national drug administration  cnda  and the ministry of food and drug safety  mfds  in south korea for the rapid and specific diagnosis of middle east respiratory syndrome  mers  caused by mers-coronavirus  mers-cov . the study, published in the journal of clinical microbiology, evaluated the analytical sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and diagnostic performance of the powerchek mers assay, which targets the urea polymerase  upe  and open reading frame 1a  orf1a  regions. the study used 100 clinical specimens, including 50 from mers-confirmed patients and 50 from mers-negative individuals, to compare the results of the powerchek mers assay with those of nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  rt-pcr  targeting the rna-dependent rna polymerase  rdrp  and nucleocapsid  n  genes. both methods gave concordant results for all 100 specimens, with a kappa value of 1.00, and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the powerchek mers assay were both 100%  95% confidence interval, 91.1–100% . the powerchek mers assay has good diagnostic performance for detecting mers-cov rna, and its simplicity and efficiency reduce the workload required for diagnosis, making it a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of mers and controlling mers outbreaks. however, further studies are needed to evaluate its performance using other specimen types and real-time pcr platforms."
pmc95862,"the study produced and characterized mabs specific for bovine rotavirus  brv  using purified viral particles as immunogen, which should aid in serotyping for selection of vaccine candidates and in the development of better diagnostic methods for detection of brv. the study identified two mabs, 8b4 and 2b11, that were g6 subtype specific and could be used for typing of american and european strains of brv. the study showed that the mabs produced by using synthetic peptide from vp7 as the immunogen for mab production were unable to detect antirotavirus antibodies as tested by elisa, while mabs produced by using purified viral particles as the immunogen were successful. the study found that differences noted in the reactivity of each mab by the various tests, such as immunodot blotting, western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and elisa, could be due to differences in test sensitivity or to differences in protein conformation. the study showed that ihc  immunohistochemical  testing, which involves fixing tissues in formalin, was less sensitive than other methods, such as if  immunofluorescence  and elisa, because brv epitopes were distorted by cross-linking induced during formalin fixation of the tissues."
pmc6930876,"a systematic review of medical reports published between 1985 and 2018 has identified a strong association between respiratory syncytial virus  rsv  infection and adverse outcomes in lung transplant recipients  ltrs . rsv was found to be the most commonly linked virus to these outcomes. the review also found that influenza a viruses and parainfluenza viruses  pivs  are major causes of morbidity and mortality among ltrs. rsv infection was noted to occur most frequently during the winter months, when rsv is most prevalent. pivs, on the other hand, were reported as causing adverse outcomes throughout the year. the study suggests that intensive, year-round surveillance for respiratory viruses among ltrs is warranted due to the severity and frequency of these adverse outcomes. the authors argue that these observations support the need for continued evaluation of the relationship between respiratory virus infection and adverse ltr outcomes, as well as intensive, year-round surveillance for respiratory viruses among ltrs."
pmc3950953,"the study aimed to develop a molecular-based therapy against feline infectious peritonitis  fip  virus, which is highly conserved among different feline species, by designing circular triple helix forming oligonucleotides  tfo  that target specific regions of the fip virus genome. the study demonstrated that all circular tfo, except for tfo2, were able to inhibit fip virus replication by binding to specific target regions of the fip virus genome, showing significant reductions in viral rna genome copy numbers compared with virus-infected cells. the study found that the reason for the lack of antiviral properties for linear tfo and unrelated circular tfo7 rna was probably due to the length of these tfo being insufficient to form functional triplex structures upon hybridization or the failure to form functional triplex structures upon hybridization. the study also found that the binding affinity of circular tfo to its target region, measured by nanoitc analysis, showed low dissociation constant  kd  values and high stability, allowing the tfos to compete effectively with the target regions for inhibiting transcription in cell-free systems. the study suggests that the circular tfo has the potential to be developed as a therapy against fip in cats, but further studies on tfo specificity, actual mechanism of circular tfo rna in transcription alteration consequence of inhibiting the viral transcription process, and in vivo animal studies are important for this approach to work as a therapy in the future."

pmc5811805,"a study conducted in four provincial hospitals in vietnam evaluated the performance of the luminex xtag respiratory viral panel fast v2 assay in detecting multiple respiratory viral pathogens in nasal and throat swabs. the study found that the overall positivity of luminex among reference assays was high  91.8%, ci 95% 88.1-94.7  and that luminex was superior to reference assays for detecting entero/rhinovirus and human pareinfluenza virus type 4. the study revealed that luminex had a significantly higher detection rate for human pareinfluenza virus type 4 than reference assays  p=0.01 , while detection rates for influenza a, influenza b, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus were confirmed by single-rt pcr  number of +l/-ref cases ranged from 3 to 69; table 2 . the study also found that the luminex assay had a lower positivity rate for human bocavirus than reference assays  p=0.04 , which may require further clinical evaluation. the study suggested that the luminex assay, with its fast turnaround time, could contribute to improving patient management and changing prescription culture in countries like vietnam, where empiric antibiotic prescription is common due to the fear of clinical worsening for patients with acute respiratory infection. the study acknowledged limitations, including the lack of a true gold standard as a diagnostic test and low numbers of positive samples for several 'uncommon' viruses, which may conceal true diagnostic rates for these viruses."
pmc6097522,"in a study investigating the potential for a universal vaccine against lasv, it was found that the genetic variability between lasv strains is considerable, with at least five clades identified. the current nigerian outbreak strain of lasv is thought to be a clade iii isolate, but has yet to be tested for efficacy against the vsv-lasv-gpc vaccine. a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus  vsv  vaccine platform was developed to prevent lasv infection. the vsv-lasv-gpc vaccine was found to be apathogenic in mice, and cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with vsv-lasv-gpc survived a lethal dose of lasv josiah with no overt signs of disease or changes in blood chemistry or hematology. a follow-up study in cynomolgus macaques found that the vsv-lasv-gpc vaccine protected animals from both lasv and ebov infection, suggesting that the vsv vector has the potential to be used repeatedly for the protection of both ebov and lasv infection in africa. in a study investigating the potential for a universal vaccine against lasv, it was found that the genetic makeup of the virus underwent a significant change allowing it to spread more readily or become more pathogenic. the vsv-lasv-gpc vaccine was found to be among one of the leading candidates developed thus far and should be targeted for accelerated development by cepi and its collaborating partners. the vsv recombinant system was found to be extremely robust and has the potential to express and tolerate the expression of multiple transgenes. the combination of both ebov and lasv glycoprotein expression in a single vaccine was found to be feasible and has significant potential to prevent future outbreaks of ebov and lasv in west africa."

pmc1563713,"the study identified 35 coronavirus-positive samples from 10 different bat species in china, representing approximately 6% of the 120 bat species identified in the country. the bat coronaviruses clustered into five distinct groups, with one group  group 5  being highly divergent from existing groups and containing viruses only from bats. the study revealed high genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats, with some viruses falling between established groups, suggesting intermediate strains. the s gene and other genes in some bat coronaviruses were highly divergent and ambiguously aligned, and the different phylogenies were unlikely due to variation in the rates of substitution. the study found that many novel coronaviruses cannot be easily accommodated in the current classification, as antigenic data were not available in many cases due to difficulty in virus isolation. the results of the study suggest that based on phylogenetic relationships, low genetic similarity, and unique genome organization, some of these novel coronaviruses are intermediate strains that fall between established groups. the study found that coronaviruses in bats exhibit high genetic diversity and high prevalence across a wide geographical distribution, possibly with asymptomatic or persistent infection. the study also revealed that bats appear to be ideal candidates for the natural reservoirs of all coronaviruses due to their high genetic diversity, high prevalence across a wide geographical distribution, and large population sizes and densities, as well as their ability to migrate. the study found that the bat coronaviruses tested had the classical coronavirus genome organization, but some bat coronaviruses had a large noncoding region at the start of the genome in which the pl domain could not be identified, and some had three orfs between the s and e genes. these findings suggest that some of these novel coronaviruses are intermediate strains that fall between established groups."
pmc4784897,"the study found that influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infection  sari  is a significant public health problem in china, particularly among adolescents and adults, with a high burden of disease during the summer and winter months. the study also revealed that less than 1% of adults hospitalized with sari in jingzhou, central china, during the surveillance period received antiviral treatment, despite the fact that over 60% of the hospitalized patients were admitted within 2 days of illness onset, the standard time for treatment initiation. the study found that corticosteroid use in sari patients was overutilized, with 30% of patients receiving corticosteroid treatment, despite the fact that only 7% were admitted to the intensive care unit during their hospitalization. the study highlighted the substantial underutilization of seasonal influenza vaccination, despite the fact that over 60% of the sari patients were hospitalized within 2 days of illness onset, the standard time for treatment initiation, and over 40% of patients were aged ≥65 years or had underlying medical conditions. the study suggested a need for further study of existing practices of empiric antibiotic treatment and corticosteroid treatment in the absence of evidence-based clinical indications, given the fact that over 30% of patients received corticosteroid treatment, despite the fact that only 7% were admitted to the intensive care unit during their hospitalization, and that over 95% of enrolled sari case-patients received empiric antibiotic treatment during their hospitalization."
pmc5879627,"the study found that the vast majority of multi-host parasites in mammals have negative standard effect sizes for host phylogenetic relatedness, suggesting phylogenetic constraints on host breadth. however, individual parasites rarely have a phylogenetic host breadth that differs significantly from expected by chance. for example, viruses often infect closely related hosts, as has been observed previously, but viral relatedness in the bat rabies system is an important factor partly controlling the sharing of parasite species among host species. the study revealed that parasites with a paratenic host may obtain a rare ultimate host that is not technically a definitive host because no reproduction occurs. for example, a helminth species with a paratenic host may establish itself in some reservoir host species and occasionally spill over to others, as occurred, for example, in the middle east respiratory syndrome  mers  coronavirus transmission from camels to humans. the study suggested that parasites with a low specificity of bacteria are more generalist than protozoa. however, future studies on restricted subsets of related parasites will allow consideration of phylogenetic structure of the parasite species. for example, viral relatedness in the bat rabies system is an important factor partly controlling the sharing of parasite species among host species. the study found that the level of host relatedness of a parasite's host set is controlled by several factors that are not measured explicitly and that sharing may arise via several different mechanisms. for example, parasites may jump between host species, maintain themselves in some reservoir host species and occasionally spill over to others, or some parasites that are apparently shared between hosts may be different species. the study highlighted the limitations of the data, including the variation in richness, variation in sampling effort, and geographic ranges of host species, which may impact the power of statistical inference associated with the null modelling approach. for example, if a parasite has only two host species, then picking many pairs of host species at random and comparing their relatedness to the relatedness of the observed pair may be more likely to result in the observation occurring towards the center of the distribution of random relatedness. this is less likely to occur when the host richness of a parasite is high. even though the study controlled for sampling effort using appropriate null models, this may not account"
pmc4865000,"a study on respiratory viruses in children with upper respiratory tract infections  uri  found that human bocavirus 1  hbv-1  was detected in 24% of uri episodes, with hbv-1 alone being associated with a high rate of acute otitis media  aom  complications. the study also revealed that hbv-1 was frequently detected in combination with other respiratory viruses, with 45% of children with hbv-1 in uri having the virus detected more than once. the incidence of hbv-1 detection in the study was among the highest published, with prolonged shedding of hbv-1 in nasal secretions observed up to 11 weeks in children attending day care and up to 3 months in otitis-prone children. the study found that viral load in cases of hbv-1 alone was relatively high, with a mean viral load of 1.8 x 1010 copies/ml of the original sample. the study suggested that hbv-1 may play an important role in aom pathogenesis, similar to other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus  rsv , adenoviruses, and coronaviruses."
pmc2895587,"blood transcriptome profiling has emerged as a critical regulatory circuit of the immune system due to its small size, stability, and potential as a source of biomarkers. short non-coding single-stranded rna molecules, known as mirnas, are about 22 nucleotides in length and have been found to play essential regulatory roles in immune function. they exhibit highly specific, regulated patterns of expression and control protein expression by translational repression, mrna cleavage, or promotion of mrna decay, and their small size allows for stable measurement in blood cells and in circulation in the serum. deconvoluting blood transcriptional signatures is a promising new field of investigation due to the complex nature of blood as a tissue. changes in transcript abundance can be attributed to either transcriptional regulation or relative changes in composition of leukocyte populations. isolation methods for individual cell populations in the blood may introduce technical bias and require extensive sample processing. an alternative approach is to deconvolute whole blood transcriptional profiles 'in silico' by deducing cellular composition or cell-specific levels of gene expression using statistical methodologies. blood transcriptome profiling is becoming a mainstream tool for the assessment of the status of the human immune system due to the influence of genetic, epigenetic, cellular, and environmental factors. changes in transcript abundance recapitulate the influence of these factors. the approach has become both robust and practical and is being used to study immune function in patients with a wide range of diseases. recent studies have demonstrated the utility of blood transcriptome profiling for monitoring immune responses to drugs or vaccines. blood transcript profiling is being used to provide complementary information to that obtained from whole blood profiles, as the immune status of a human subject is not entirely reflected by the blood profile obtained at the steady state. blood transcriptome profiling is being used to assess the status of the human immune system. the immune system of a human subject is not entirely reflected by its blood profile obtained at the steady state, as the immune system's capacity to respond to innate as well as antigen-specific immune signals may also provide useful and complementary information. blood transcriptome profiling is being used to provide this complementary information, in addition to that obtained from whole blood profiles. the approach is being used"
pmc538726,"mhv enters progenitor oligodendrocyte cg-4 cells but restricts viral replication and prevents cell death, resulting in persistent, nonproductive infection. overexpression of the cellular survival gene bcl-xl in mhv-infected cg-4 cells converts acute infection to persistent, nonproductive infection and prevents cell death. infectious mhv is not recovered from cg-4 cells beyond two passages, indicating that mhv persistence in cg-4 cells is nonproductive. viral genomic rna sequences are consistently amplified from persistently infected cg-4 cells, suggesting that downregulation of viral gene expression and function is an important mechanism for viral persistence in cg-4 cells. mhv persistence in cg-4 cells is likely controlled by intracellular factors rather than by neutralizing antibodies, as observed in mhv-infected b-cell-deficient mice, where neutralizing antibodies prevent reinfection but do not severely block intracellular virus replication."
pmc3367634,"a new genotype of porcine norovirus  gii-19  closely related to human gii noroviruses has been identified in swine in china. this porcine norovirus genotype, similar to the qw101 strain, shares high amino acid identity with human gii noroviruses from three different continents. the porcine norovirus genotype qw101-like, similar to the human gii norovirus strain, replicated in gnotobiotic pigs and shed through fecal shedding. antigenic cross-reactivity between antiserum to the porcine norovirus genotype qw101-like and capsid proteins of human gii noroviruses was observed, with highest cross-reactivity to gii-3, 4, and 6 noroviruses. the identification of potential recombinant porcine norovirus strains raises questions about whether pigs may serve as reservoirs for the emergence of new human noroviruses or if porcine/human gii recombinants could emerge."
pmc3411035,"circular proteins differ from linear proteins in having one additional peptide bond, giving them enhanced stability against breakdown by proteolytic enzymes and other biochemical advantages, making them attractive for agricultural, diagnostic, and pharmaceutical applications. cyclotides, a large class of circular proteins found in plants and fungi, have a cystine knot and are particularly stable due to their structure. they disrupt membranes and have insecticidal, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties. bacterial circular proteins, including pilins, bacteriocins, and cyanobactins, have well-understood biosynthetic pathways, and some show potential as food preservatives, bacterial infections treatments, or as anti-hiv agents. the human immune system uses θ-defensins, circular peptides encoded by two truncated α-defensin genes that contribute just 9 amino acids each to the mature cyclic peptide. synthetic retrocyclin peptides corresponding to these gene sequences are potent anti-hiv agents and have shown promise as topical microbicides to prevent sexually transmitted hiv-1 infections. biological chemists are making synthetic versions of naturally occurring circular proteins using thioester chemistry via native chemical ligation or recombinant dna expression techniques, which can be used to make genetically encoded libraries of cyclic peptides for screening purposes. remaining challenges include the development of assays to rapidly and specifically detect the presence of cyclic proteins and the delineation of their biosynthetic mechanisms."
pmc3976413,"a study found that 58.5-96.4% of the adult population in the united states has geographic access to high capability centers for severe acute respiratory failure, depending on the duration of interhospital transport assumed. the study identified several states with no geographic access to high capability centers, highlighting the need for immediate action to transfer patients with severe acute respiratory failure to the closest high capability center. the study also identified many states with incomplete geographic access, emphasizing the need for further evaluation of regionalized critical care infrastructure. the alignment of healthcare systems with public health efforts has the potential to improve the routine care of patients with severe acute respiratory failure and promote regional systems of audit and feedback for continuous improvement. the study revealed that adequate referral center access in the case of disasters and pandemics depends highly on local and regional care coordination across political boundaries."
pmc4584133,"the study aimed to identify different species of the fungus trichophyton using molecular identification methods. the study found that the rolling circle amplification  rca  technique, which involves using circularizable oligonucleotides or padlock probes, can rapidly and specifically identify trichophyton species, with 100% concordance with phenotypic identification. the study also found that the specificity of the t. tonsurans probe is ambiguous due to its close relationship with t. equinum, as they differ by only a single base in the its1 region. the study suggests that designing padlock probes targeting other genes, such as beta-tubulin  bt2  and translation elongation factor 1-alpha  tef1 , may be beneficial for species identification, as the its1 region does not have sufficient discrimination ability. the study highlights that the rca-based assay is an alternative to dna sequencing for species identification, especially for epidemiological and phylogenetic purposes and for genotype delineation, despite the shortcomings of current molecular identification systems."
pmc3436031,"in a study on isothermal nucleic acid amplification, the authors discussed various techniques such as polymerase chain reaction  pcr , loop-mediated isothermal amplification  lamp , strand displacement amplification  sda , rolling circle amplification  rca , helicase-dependent amplification  hda , and beacon-assisted detection amplification  bad-amp . they found that hda and rca have the potential to be applied in point-of-care devices due to their simplicity, low cost, and short detection times. the authors reported that hda and rca can be integrated into microchip-based systems for rapid, label-free, specific detection. they also mentioned that the development of chip-based isothermal assay systems has received great attention, and further improvement in on-chip sample pretreatment, miniaturization of detectors, decrease in power consumption, and the establishment of quality control is required for their commercialization. the authors observed that integrated microchip systems are particularly desirable because these systems provide significant advantages in convenience and cost-effectiveness, simultaneously simplifying operational procedures and shortening analysis times. they also noted that no device reported thus far is clearly superior, resulting in the possibility that sensing platforms based on different isothermal amplifications may find their way to market. the authors mentioned that the development of chip-based isothermal assay systems requires further improvement in on-chip sample pretreatment, miniaturization of detectors, decrease in power consumption, and the establishment of quality control. they also noted that no device reported thus far is clearly superior, resulting in the possibility that sensing platforms based on different isothermal amplifications may find their way to market. the authors reported that microfluidic dna assays involving on-chip isothermal amplification have also been developed for hda. they noted that such an integrated microchip device, with its ease of use and short detection time, can become a portable device for rapid, label-free, specific detection."
pmc4211911,"the majority of participants in this study believed that anyone could commit suicide and that suicide is preventable. participants who reported a higher level of maternal care tended to think that suicide occurs commonly and that people do not have the right to commit suicide. previous studies have found differences in attitudes toward suicide among medical students, pharmacists, and general practitioners in various countries. a low level of maternal care predicted severe depressive symptoms and partially mediated low self-esteem in a 10-year follow-up study of norwegian physicians. to achieve more positive attitudes toward suicide prevention, promoting the best practices for suicide prevention is needed for medical students, as child rearing support may be associated with suicide prevention."
pmc5658573,"two hanwoo calves, aged 3 and 6 months, developed hypovitaminosis a with symptoms of diarrhoea, temporary anorexia, and blindness for a week. the calves exhibited bilateral dilated pupils with no menace response or pupillary light reflex, and swollen optic discs with indistinct margins in both eyes, with signs of papilledema and enlargement of the retinal veins. routine serum chemistry and electrolyte levels were not significantly changed in either calf, but their serum vitamin a concentrations were low, at 0.481 and 0.317 µg/dl for calves 1 and 2, respectively. the calves' blindness was caused by hypovitaminosis a, as confirmed by the low serum vitamin a concentrations and the ophthalmic findings. treatment with intramuscular injection or dietary supplementation of vitamin a was recommended, but the owner chose only dietary supplementation, which did not result in any clinical response in the affected calves. however, no further ocular problems were observed in the herd after dietary supplementation."
pmc3647674,"a novel betacoronavirus was detected in insectivorous nycteris bats in ghana and europe, belonging to the previously known 2c clade. this virus is phylogenetically basal to the human coronavirus emciv, as well as to two related bat coronaviruses recently identified in europe. the prevalence of the novel coronavirus in nycteris bats was significantly higher in juvenile bats and lactating females than in adult and nonlactating females, respectively. virus concentrations in feces were also high. the new virus, as well as the related viruses in europe, were closely related to a virus recently identified in a patient in the arabian peninsula. this suggests the possibility of another human coronavirus with a potential animal reservoir in bats from the old world. the detection rates of coronaviruses were significantly higher among juvenile and lactating bats in a previous study of vespertilionid bats from temperate climates. this amplification may also apply to the nycteris bat coronavirus. the high virus concentrations, use of water from bat caves and guano as fertilizer for farming, and hunting of bats as wild game throughout africa may facilitate host switching events. further studies should still include isolation attempts to obtain full virus genomes and identify virulence factors contributing to the high pathogenicity of the newly identified coronaviruses."
pmc2958001,"in the context of pandemic influenza preparedness, a study by zimmer et al.  2010  found that some employment characteristics, such as inability to work from home and lack of paid sick leave, are associated with reports of experiencing serious financial problems if isolated from work over the 3 periods  7–10 days, 1 month, and 3 months. low- and middle-income workers were significantly more likely than high-income workers to report financial problems in all 3 periods. the study also found that workers living in urban areas were more likely than those living in rural areas to fear job insecurity, which could pose substantial problems for pandemic influenza mitigation because those in urban areas may be strongly encouraged to remain isolated to avoid virus spread in conditions of population density and crowding. in the context of pandemic influenza mitigation, findings from a study by zimmer et al.  2010  suggest that working with employers to ensure work-from-home or sick leave capabilities for nonessential employees and planning to provide state or federal supplementary income support and job protection for workers who would not be paid if they missed work because of official pandemic mitigation recommendations could increase the likelihood of compliance with isolation recommendations. these strategies could include working with employers to ensure work-from-home or sick leave capabilities for nonessential employees and planning to provide state or federal supplementary income support and job protection for workers who would not be paid if they missed work because of official pandemic mitigation recommendations. in the context of pandemic influenza mitigation, the study by zimmer et al.  2010  found that low- and middle-income workers would have more difficulty complying with isolation recommendations than would upper-income groups, particularly at 3 months’ of isolation, when persons from all income levels, especially low-income, would likely experience serious financial problems. in the context of pandemic influenza mitigation, the study by zimmer et al.  2010  suggested that an existing mechanism for delivering financial support to affected persons, such as unemployment insurance, could be used to disperse lump-sum payments to those financially affected by a pandemic, if the severity of an outbreak warranted isolation from the workplace for long periods. in the context of pandemic influenza mitigation, future population surveys could attempt to disentangle beliefs"
pmc4501813,"in a study investigating the safety and efficacy of using spray-dried porcine plasma  sdpp  as an animal feed ingredient, researchers found that sdpp is a safe protein ingredient that does not transmit porcine circovirus type 2  pcv2  or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  prrsv , two of the more thermal and solvent resistant known viruses. however, as microbes evolve and new pathogens are discovered, it is prudent to evaluate additional technology that may further minimize risks associated with feeding biological products to animals intended for human consumption. in a feeding experiment, the researchers found that dietary sdpp improved pig performance compared to pigs fed the control diet without sdpp, and that uvc-irradiated sdpp tended to enhance performance in general over control sdpp. the researchers also observed a tendency of improved pig performance during the first 14 days and better performance over the whole period when pigs were fed diets with uvc-irradiated sdpp compared with non uvc-irradiated sdpp diets. the results obtained in the uvc-irradiated sdpp study suggest that the microbiological quality of uvc-treated sdpp was improved, and that uvc irradiation had no negative effect on animal performance."
pmc4045761,"the study found that the silver salt of sucrose octasulfate  iasos  has antimicrobial properties against bacterial and yeast pathogens commonly found in women with symptomatic vaginitis. the study demonstrated that iasos, the patented silver salt of sucrose octasulfate, displayed antimicrobial activity against a number of bacterial strains involved in the onset of symptomatic vaginitis, as well as against the yeast candida albicans, responsible for one of the most frequent vaginal fungal infections. the study showed that the vaginal gel formulation containing iasos, silsos femme, displayed important antimicrobial effects against bacterial and yeast pathogens, suggesting a potential role of this novel formulation in the prevention and/or treatment of feminine vaginal infections as an adjunct to drug therapy. the study found that the antimicrobial activity of the vaginal gel silsos femme against bacterial and yeast pathogens was dependent on the final concentration of available silver ions, with an amount as high as 32 mg per cm2 being necessary to achieve a visible inhibition of microbial growth in the study's experimental conditions. the study suggested that other ingredients into the gel formulation, such as ksos and hya, may synergize iasos’s antimicrobial activity through their antiadhesion properties."
pmc4404480,"non-health workers were more concerned about acquiring infectious diseases during the hajj season compared to health workers, particularly with ebola virus. this finding highlights the need for more training and education for non-health workers regarding preventive measures against infectious diseases. most non-health workers were not aware of specific procedures to follow when dealing with a suspected infectious disease case. this finding suggests the need for more training and education for non-health workers regarding infection control protocols during the hajj season. most non-health workers did not receive any form of training before or during the hajj season. this finding emphasizes the need for more training and education for non-health workers regarding preventive measures against infectious diseases during the hajj season. most non-health workers were not aware of any specific notification method when dealing with a public health threatening event. this finding indicates the need for more training and education for non-health workers regarding infection control protocols during the hajj season. most non-health workers did not receive any form of training before or during the hajj season. this finding highlights the need for more training and education for non-health workers regarding preventive measures against infectious diseases during the hajj season, and suggests that there is a lack of proper organizational efforts to educate airport workers on the risk of infectious diseases and methods of protection during the hajj season."
pmc6430554,"the study found that hepatitis e virus  hev  genotype 8, previously detected in camels in china, can cause acute hepatitis in cynomolgus macaques. the study identified three complete genome sequences of hev8 from the fecal sample collected from gansu province  bchev-gp  and two macaques that were inoculated with the filtered fecal sample containing bchev-gp  m1 and m2 . the study performed histopathological and immunofluorescence assays on liver biopsies from the infected macaques to understand the pathogenicity of hev8 in macaques. the study quantified the hepatitis e virus genome copy number of hev8 from the fecal sample collected from gansu province  bchev-gp  and the two macaques that were inoculated with the filtered fecal sample containing bchev-gp  m1 and m2 . the study constructed phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequences of the pcr screening fragments and the amino acid sequences of concatenated orf1/orf2 excluding the hvr in orf1 to calculate the mean amino acid genetic distances between bchev-gp, m1, and m2 and other hev genotypes."
pmc1200281,"the study identified a new virus, human bocavirus  hbv , in respiratory tract samples from infants and young children. hbv is a member of the parvovirus family, which infects birds and mammals, and belongs to the recently established genus bocavirus. hbv was primarily found in respiratory tract samples from children with unknown etiology, suggesting a likely causative role in respiratory tract disease. hbv was detected in 7% of respiratory tract samples from children with respiratory tract symptoms, but was not detected in samples from children without respiratory tract symptoms. the study used a combination of host dna depletion, optimized nucleic acid amplification, large-scale sequencing, and bioinformatics to identify unknown viruses, and suggested that this method is efficient for virus discovery."
pmc4460227,"a study found that inserting a peptide sequence corresponding to the main neutralizing epitope of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  prrsv  into the hypervariable regions  hvrs  of human adenovirus serotype 5  ad5  hexon protein resulted in the production of recombinant ad5 viruses. the peptide sequence was inserted into the hvrs of the hexon protein in three different locations  hvr7, hvr8, and hvr9  using synthetic oligonucleotides. the study found that the virus containing the peptide sequence in the hvr7 location showed a significant reduction in viral particle production, while the viruses containing the peptide sequence in the hvr8 or hvr9 locations showed a significant increase in viral particle production compared to the wild-type virus. the study also found that the virus containing the peptide sequence in the hvr8 location showed a significant reduction in cytopathic effect  cpe  compared to the wild-type virus, while the virus containing the peptide sequence in the hvr9 location showed a significant increase in cpe. the study developed a method to test if the peptide incorporated into the hexon protein is accessible to anti-peptide antibody at the virion level using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  elisa . the study found that the elisa could detect the peptide sequence in the viral particles at concentrations ranging from 10^5^ to 10^10^ viral particles."
pmc3722273,"the study analyzed data from a large set of markers, selected using the lasso method, to estimate influenza activity in real-time. the study found that there are clear seasonal variations in influenza activity, with a marked peak at wintertime in temperate regions. the study demonstrated that the lasso method can be used to select a subset of markers and their weights to maximize the correlation with influenza activity, but there is a strong inter-dependence among the marker frequencies. the study showed that optimization of the number of markers was necessary, and subsequent automatic marker selection generated a set of 40 markers. the study revealed large positive coefficients assigned to markers like 'novel flu', 'lightly', 'flu', and so on, and also markers with large negative coefficients like 'surely', 'winter', 'concert', and so on. the study showed that computation of the coefficients depended largely on ili surveillance reports when their value was fully available, but since ili surveillance reports come via identification of influenza viruses with a delay of up to 1–2 weeks, direct comparison of the predicted values with the ili data was not straightforward. the study noted that there are clear seasonal variations in the occurrence of influenza, with a marked peak at wintertime in temperate regions, but when the previous year's seasonal ili data is absent, the prediction accuracy is significantly lower at the initial phase of the ili peak, when prediction is of most importance and enough data of the present season are not yet available to accurately perform the prediction. the study found that by calculating the regression coefficients using the most recent set of data, the algorithm can easily adapt to time-varying environments, albeit slowly. the study proposed an adaptive algorithm for real-time prediction of influenza infection using han-geul twitter data."
pmc3081318,"this study identified two novel variants of simian hemorrhagic fever virus  shfv  in a wild red colobus monkey from uganda. these variants, named shfv-krc1 and shfv-krc2, are highly divergent from each other and from the previously described shfv type strain. both variants contain homologs of the type strain shfv orfs 2a, 2b, and 3, but their genomic architecture, including additional orfs at the 3' end, is distinct from that of other arteriviruses. phylogenetic analysis revealed that shfv is more divergent than any other arterivirus, with a degree of within-species divergence approximately equivalent to that between prrsv and ldv, which are considered different viral species. the study also suggested that wild african primates, including red colobus, may harbor a very diverse population of shfv variants. the study highlights the utility of direct pyrosequencing for detecting novel viruses and characterizing viral genomic architecture during natural infection. the method, which combines random hexamer-primed reverse transcription and double-stranded cdna synthesis, obviated the need for pcr amplification and prevented the potential introduction of amplification-induced error and template bias associated with whole genome amplification. the study provides evidence that wild african primates can harbor shfv subclinically and suggests that these primates may be reservoirs for unknown pathogens of potential concern for global health. the study underscores the need for extreme care when introducing primates into new environments, as asymptomatic carriers of novel viral pathogens might come into contact with clinically susceptible hosts."
pmc3993214,"the study developed an antibody-mediated delivery system for the delivery of sirna into ha-positive cells infected with h5n1 virus, using huscfv as a targeting ligand. the system consisted of immunoliposomes entrapped with sirna against the influenza virus nucleoprotein, with approximately 20 huscfv molecules per liposome. the study demonstrated the successful use of huscfv in antibody-mediated delivery and an improved potency of sirna delivery in an in vitro h5n1 infection model, using mdck cells. the study showed that the sirna-mediated inhibition of h5n1 replication was enhanced by the targeted delivery using huscfv-mediated cell targeting, but not necessarily by the antibody-neutralizing activity of huscfv itself. the study indicated that the huscfv-mediated cell targeting could potentially be valuable for both prophylactic as well as therapeutic treatments against h5n1 infection, as long as the targeting antibodies bind to the ha protein, the conserved epitope of the antigenically diverse h5n1 strains, to achieve therapeutic value for controlling infections from current and future h5n1 variants. the study showed that the sirna efficacy in inhibiting h5n1 replication was still present when applied after viral infection, resulting in a 10-fold reduction in the viral titer compared with the titer with nontargeted liposomes."
pmc6316779,"the study found that the egyptian fruit bat  rousettus aegyptiacus  ace2 receptor is a suitable host receptor for the wiv1-cov virus, as it was able to bind and mediate entry and infection in cells transfected with the bat ace2 gene. ace2 expression was identified in multiple organs, including the nasal turbinates, apical olfactory epithelium, serous submucosal glands, pars nervosa of the pituitary gland, and lung tissue, suggesting necessary receptor expression to produce infection in egyptian fruit bats. the study found limited evidence of virus replication and seroconversion in egyptian fruit bats following inoculation with wiv1-cov, suggesting that the ability to infect and replicate efficiently is bat species-specific. the study observed some low-level virus replication in two out of twelve bats, resulting in an adaptive immune response, as indicated by the presence of sars-cov-specific antibodies. the study did not detect an increase in the presence of sars-cov-specific antibodies in most of the bats, but some low-level virus replication might have occurred in these bats, resulting in an adaptive immune response."
pmc4088223,"the study of endothelial cells in vitro is complicated by their marked heterogeneity and tendency to lose tissue-specific markers when cultured. many classical endothelial markers are widely expressed, and there is variability in detection of phenotypic markers between animal and human systems. the increasing knowledge of endothelial receptors is providing a larger and better defined set of phenotypic markers. examples of this are the large number of scavenger receptors expressed by hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, which provide clues to specific functions of the cells being studied. the study of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells  hsec  in vitro has been hampered by the lack of specific markers that can conclusively identify these cells and discriminate them from vascular or lymphatic endothelial cells. however, the increasing knowledge of endothelial receptors is providing us with a larger and better defined set of phenotypic markers. cultured hsec do exhibit some useful identifying features, but these changes rapidly disappear within a passage or two in culture. apart from these changes, the cells remain relatively phenotypically stable for 7-8 passages and can be identified by expression of cd31, lyve-1, dc-signr l-sign , stabilin-1, and lack of cd34 and prox-1, which confirm endothelial identity while excluding vascular and lymphatic endothelial contamination and in conjunction with markers to exclude cells of leukocyte origin can be used to confirm the sinusoidal nature of the cells. the study of hsec in vitro has shown that the cells retain fenestrations in vitro for a short time but these rapidly disappear within a passage or two in culture, as does expression of vap-1. however, the cells remain relatively phenotypically stable for 7-8 passages. these findings highlight the challenges of studying hsec in vitro, but also suggest potential strategies for overcoming these challenges, such as the use of specific markers to confirm endothelial identity and the sinusoidal nature of the cells."
pmc3734712,"in the pre-clinical study conducted by the authors, they developed a rabies vaccine using a recombinant dna technology, and it was found to be safe and effective in rhesus monkeys. the study involved sub-chronic and chronic toxicity evaluations, immunogenicity and immunotoxicology testing, and organ necropsy and histopathology analysis. the vaccine was found to be safe at a 10-fold higher dose than the therapeutic dose, and there was no evidence of anti-dsdna or anti-nuclear antibodies in the serum of animals on day 120 post-exposure. the study also found that the vaccine induced a maximum immune stimulating response at the highest dose, but no adverse reactions were observed at this dose, suggesting the safety of the test material. the authors noted that the safety evaluation of biological products, including biotechnology-manufactured substances, requires relevant species with appropriate immunological response. they selected rhesus monkeys, a non-human primate, as the species for safety evaluation because of their relative affinity, distribution of receptors for the intended clinical product, and appropriate immunological response. the study found that there was no evidence of any exaggerated responses in lymphoid tissues in the animals exposed to the vaccine, even after 120 days post-exposure, suggesting the safety of the test material. the authors noted that the presence of residual dna at the site of injection in one female monkey exposed to the vaccine was present in traces, which is unlikely to integrate into the host genome due to the sensitivity of the pcr analysis, which is to determine the presence of residual dna in femtograms. this finding adds to the existing data on the evaluation of dna products as preventive/therapeutic agents in clinical conditions."
pmc5321413,"the teshs study has identified a unique u-shape distribution of chlamydia trachomatis infection in younger and older women in hong kong, which is different from other population-based studies conducted elsewhere. the overall prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis in hong kong, as identified by teshs, is lower compared to estimates from europe or the us but similar to those reported in other developed countries. teshs has found that chlamydia trachomatis is more common among young individuals in hong kong, which is consistent with data from other developed countries. teshs has identified that partners traveling out of hong kong within the past 12 months are a risk factor for chlamydia trachomatis infection among sexually experienced females in hong kong, which is similar to findings in other population-based studies in china. based on the findings of teshs, chlamydia trachomatis screening for sexually active youth and older women  aged 40-49 years  in hong kong could be cost-effective, given the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis in these populations."
pmc1698775,"the study demonstrates that primary human sinusoidal endothelial cells  hsecs  express functional decin-1 receptors  dc-sign and dc-signr  in vivo, providing evidence for their unique antigen-processing and -scavenging properties. the study confirms that hsecs fail to support infection with the hepatitis c virus  hcv , indicating that dc-sign and dc-signr on sinusoidal endothelium provide a mechanism for high-affinity binding of circulating hcv within the liver sinusoids allowing transfer of the virus to underlying hepatocytes, in a manner analogous to dendritic cell dc-sign presenting hiv to t lymphocytes. the study shows that expression of dc-sign by hsecs is interleukin-4  il-4 -dependent in endothelial cells, as well as in myeloid cells, suggesting that il-4 is the key cytokine for dc-sign acquisition during hsec differentiation. the study provides evidence that il-4 but not il-12 or interferon-γ increases expression of dc-sign on hsecs in vitro, indicating that induction of dc-sign on hsecs will be promoted by th2 rather than th1 cytokine responses consistent with the requirement for vigorous th1 responses to clear viral infection. the study demonstrates that dc-sign and dc-signr on sinusoidal endothelium provide a complementary role in trapping hcv within the hepatic sinusoids, suggesting that the local cytokine microenvironment may affect hcv cell attachment and infectivity."
pmc446266,"the study reports the development of a sandwich elisa for the detection of sars-cov nucleocapsid protein, which is specific for sars-cov and has a high sensitivity for nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens during the early phase of infection, as early as day 6 from symptom onset. the elisa is specific for sars-cov as the nucleocapsid protein shares only 32.7% and 21.3% amino acid identities with those of human coronaviruses oc43 and 229e, respectively. the study shows that nucleocapsid protein can be detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens as early as day 6 from symptom onset and in 83% of samples taken from days 11 to 15. the study suggests that the elisa may detect cases that rt-pcr has missed, as 6 of the 34 positive nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens and 9 of the 36 positive fecal specimens were found to be negative by rt-pcr. the study indicates that the elisa may serve as an alternative tool for the early diagnosis of sars-cov infection in laboratories with limited resources and expertise, as it is more convenient and economical than rt-pcr."
pmc6518565,"a meta-analysis of nine studies involving a total of 1,232 participants found that individuals carrying the c allele of the rs12252 variant in the ifitm3 gene have a higher risk of contracting influenza, with a three-fold increase in susceptibility to severe influenza compared to mild influenza in the severe vs. mild subgroup analysis. the study also found significant associations between the rs12252 variant and influenza in all four genetic models  allelic, dominant, recessive, and homozygote  in both asian and caucasian subgroup analyses, with the risk of influenza increasing 1.54-fold, 1.38-fold, 2.38-fold, and 2.80-fold, respectively. the study highlights the importance of gene c in the ifitm3 gene in susceptibility to influenza infection, as previous meta-analyses had not found any significant connection between the rs12252 variant and patients with mild infection. the study also identified a new association between the rs12252 variant and influenza in the severe vs. mild subgroup analysis, as previous meta-analyses had not found any significant connection between the rs12252 variant and patients with mild infection. the study's results indicate that individuals carrying the c allele of the rs12252 variant in the ifitm3 gene are more susceptible to influenza infection, regardless of ethnicity, as the study found significant differences in all four genetic models in both asian and caucasian subgroup analyses. the study's findings suggest that the ifitm3 gene may play a critical role in the host's response to influenza infection, as the risk of influenza increases with the number of c alleles in the ifitm3 gene, and the study's results are consistent with the findings of previous studies that have reported a reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infection in individuals carrying the c allele of the rs12252 variant in the ifitm3 gene. the study's results also suggest that the ifitm3 gene may have different effects on influenza susceptibility in different ethnic groups,"
pmc4864560,"the authors report two cases of neurological complications in patients infected with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus  mers-cov . the first patient, a 34-year-old female with diabetes, presented with symptoms of encephalitis, including ataxia, vomiting, confusion, and fever. she had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are considered comorbidities in this case. the diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalomyelitisitis  adem . treatments included broad-spectrum antibiotics, oseltamivir, bronchodilators, methylprednisolone, intravenous sedation, neuromuscular blockers, inhaled nitric oxide, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, peginterferon alpha-2b, and ribavirin. the outcome was death due to deep coma, poor overall condition, and worsening cardiovascular and respiratory status. the second patient, a 28-year-old male with diabetes, presented with flu-like illness, fever, and a gangrenous toe. he had a history of diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease bilateral anterior cerebral artery stroke. the diagnosis was critical illness polyneuropathy complicating a long intensive care unit  icu  stay. treatments included broad-spectrum antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin, pulse steroid therapy, respiratory support, and physiotherapy. the outcome was recovery with improvement in respiratory functions, extubation, and transfer to the floor. the authors propose a different theory for explaining the mechanism by which mers-cov reaches the nervous system, which is predominantly through the autoimmune theory with several involvements of the neural tissues and blood vessels through autoreactive t-cells recognizing both viral and myelin antigens as similar molecules, resulting in neurological complications in genetically susceptible individuals. the authors suggest that using steroids in mers-cov infected cases that present with or develop neurological complications will be beneficial in reducing the mort"
pmc2992623,"in the context of the global epidemic of hiv, civil society organizations  csos  in china have significantly increased their participation in and contribution to hiv prevention, treatment, care, and support programs. by the end of 2009, over 3,000 csos were involved in china's response to hiv, with over 1,000 of these csos being unregistered grassroots initiatives. the csos in china's hiv response have expanded their scope of work, with over 337 unregistered csos engaged in legal aid, litigation, human rights, and explicit advocacy being few, but some, such as aids care china  acc  and chengdu gay community organization  cgco , are now having a significant impact on anti-retroviral  arv  treatment adherence of people living with hiv  plhiv  and hiv testing among men who have sex with men  msm . acc, an unregistered grassroots cso led by plhiv, established in 2003, has grown into a network covering four provinces, and in 2009 alone, reached over 15,000 msm with comprehensive prevention services. the cgco, also an unregistered cso, began implementing hiv behavior change interventions such as outreach, peer education, and testing with the msm population in chengdu city in december 2002, with a voluntary counseling and testing  vct  service center established close to the center, where counseling and testing services are offered free of charge to the msm community. through this integrated approach, the cgco has been able to significantly increase the number of msm receiving hiv testing from 156 in 2003 to 15,36 in 2009."
pmc5777272,"weakly transmissible vaccines have the advantage of not transmitting far beyond the directly vaccinated individuals, which makes them less likely to evolve than highly transmissible vaccines. this is because immune compromised hosts may allow a long-standing infection that leads to evolution within one host, but with weakly transmissible vaccines, revertants  strains that have ejected or downregulated the antigenic insert  have less within-host and herd immunity than the vaccine. the challenge for a recombinant vector vaccine, which faces competition from the pathogen and vector, is to choose a vector that has a suitably high transmission rate. this is because if immunity to the vector is widespread, vaccine transmission may be limited even when the intrinsic vaccine transmission rate is high. the choice of vector will influence several of the critical properties of a vaccine, and indeed, may have a profound effect on vaccine success, on vaccine evolution, and on side-effects. in the extreme case of a vector that is not found in the host population  e.g., is from a different species , pre-existing immunity will be absent, which is a benefit. this is because pre-existing immunity will be absent, and transmission may even be avoided by use of a vector from a different species. in the case of a recombinant vector vaccine that reverts to the wild-type state, revertants  strains that have ejected or downregulated the antigenic insert  are also blocked by ongoing vaccination, provided the complete vaccine elicits immunity against both the pathogen and vector."
pmc4714882,"the study conducted in a taiwanese breeding herd found that the porcine epidemic diarrhea  pedv  virus infection significantly affected the reproductive and growth performance of gilts and sows, resulting in prolonged neonatal diarrhea, high mortality rates in neonatal piglets, and poorer performance of surviving pigs. the study revealed that the influence of pedv on neonatal diarrhea and mortality was more severe in infected herds with high suckling mortality, and that the lactation period was extended due to the incomplete uterine involution and tissue repair in early-weaned sows. the study also found that the impact of pedv on neonatal diarrhea and mortality led to a significant increase in abortion rates, as well as a decrease in farrowing rates and an increase in weaning-to-first service intervals, resulting in a prolongation of non-productive days and a decrease in the number of pigs weaned per reproductive lifetime. the study highlighted that the impact of pedv on neonatal diarrhea and mortality also impaired the productivity indices in gilts and sows, as evidenced by the increase in weaning-to-first service intervals, the decrease in the number of pigs born alive per mating, and the prolongation of non-productive days in primiparous sows. the study suggested that the control and improvement of the impact of pedv on neonatal diarrhea and mortality may alter the management of females, including the reduction in abortion rates, the decrease in lactation length, the decrease in the percentage of gilts in the breeding-female inventory, and the increase in the percentage of multiple matings."
pmc3031662,"tetracyclines are a class of antibiotics that have been used for over 60 years. the most commonly used tetracyclines are tetracycline  tc , doxycycline  doxy , and minocycline  min . tc, doxy, and min have all been shown to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases  mmps , enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix  ecm  proteins. this inhibition is beneficial in many pathological conditions in which mmp-mediated proteolysis contributes to pathogenesis, such as heart remodeling, tumor invasion, and inflammation. currently, the only clinically available mmp inhibitor is doxy, and it is indicated only for the treatment of periodontitis. tc, doxy, and min all have a multiple-substituted phenol ring, similar to vitamin e. the phenol ring is key to the reactive oxygen species  ros  scavenging abilities of these compounds. min directly scavenges ros in several cell-free mixed-radical assays with an ic50 of 3-40 μm, which is 9-250 times more potent than tc or doxy. in addition to inhibiting mmps directly, tc, doxy, and min all inhibit mmp synthesis. doxy inhibited cytokine-induced mmp-8 mrna and protein accumulation in cultured rat synovial fibroblasts. in cultured human skin fibroblasts, tc inhibited interleukin-1  il-1 -induced mmp-3 expression. since mmp transcription is induced by a host of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other growth factors, it is likely that these upstream signaling cascades leading to mmp expression are important targets of tc, doxy, and min. the tetracyclines possess anti-inflammatory properties. doxy is successfully used in the treatment of skin conditions such as acne and rosacea. biopsies of inflammatory lesions of patients with acne yield increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-α"
pmc3653767,"in a study published in the journal of virology, researchers found that s2m, a structure found in the genomes of certain viruses, appears to provide a selective advantage to the host viruses through a complex interplay with an existing cellular mechanism. however, the authors noted that the lack of intermediate/primitive forms of s2m in viral genomes suggests that the virus somehow benefits from acquiring the sequence motif, but the precise mechanism through which this occurs is currently unknown. a study published in the journal phytoparasitica found that the s2m element is present in four different families of positive-strand rna viruses  astroviruses, coronaviruses, calciviruses, and picornaviruses. the authors noted that a parsimonious explanation for the distribution of s2m would imply that the ancestral state for this element was to contain s2m in all of these virus families, with losses of the sequence motif occurring independently in certain viral lineages. a study published in the journal virology found that the s2m-containing astrovirus genomes were not significantly different from those that lacked s2m in terms of pathogenicity, host specificity, or virulence. a study published in the journal virus research found that the s2m-containing picornavirus genomes were not significantly different from those that lacked s2m in terms of host specificity or virulence. a study published in the journal phytoparasitica found that the s2m-containing astrovirus genomes were not significantly different from those that lacked s2m in terms of virulence or host specificity."

pmc4442375,"two recent coronavirus emergences, sars-cov and mers-cov, have resulted in severe disease, with the latter having a 38% mortality rate. while coronaviruses have frequently undergone host range expansion events, two recent events have led to the emergence of highly pathogenic epidemic strains. the functional receptor for mers-cov, dipeptidyl peptidase 4  dpp4 , was recently identified. mers-cov can utilize human, bat, and camel dpp4, but traditional small animal models, such as mice, are nonpermissive. the importance of small animal models for studying pathogenesis and for developing vaccines and therapeutics led researchers to identify the determinants of interactions between the mers-cov receptor binding domain  rbd  and mouse dpp4  mdpp4 . researchers found that two key residues in mdpp4  a288l and t330r  could permit infection by mers-cov when mutated to the human dpp4  hdpp4  amino acids. these residues lie within blades iv and v of the β-propeller domain. the importance of a288l can be understood by recognizing that there is a strong hydrophobic region in the mers-cov rbd that engages the equivalent hdpp4 residue  l294 . the researchers found that removal of the glycosylation site, rather than addition of the charged residue at position 330, is responsible for regulating mdpp4 receptor activity. removal of the glycosylation site, rather than addition of the charged residue at position 330, is necessary to permit infection by mers-cov, rather than addition of the charged residue at position 330. all derivatives of the dpp4 receptors are expressed at the cell surface and available to interact with the mers-cov rbd. the researchers found that while glycosylation is an important barrier, its removal is not sufficient to permit infection in the absence of the a-to-l modification at position 288. this suggests that while glycosylation is"
pmc4564540,"this study confirmed that the ebola virus entry factor, tim-1, and the marburg virus entry factor, axl, augment entry into susceptible cell lines, but their expression is dispensable for ebola virus infection of macrophages. the study found that less axl and tim-1 mrna is produced in monocyte-derived macrophages  mdms  compared with susceptible cell lines, indicating that lack of expression does not account for the resistance of mdms to gp-driven entry. the study revealed that expression of the mannose-specific lectin, mer, but not axl, is required for efficient gp-driven transduction and ebola virus infection of mdms. the study found that sirnas against integrin αv and sr-a reduced gp-driven entry into mdms and ebola virus infection of mdms, suggesting that other factors, besides mer, might contribute to these processes in macrophages. the study suggested that sr-a is expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells and contributes to the macrophage uptake of a broad spectrum of ligands, including apoptotic cells, and that ebola virus glycoprotein  gp -driven transduction of mdms was also inhibited by tannic acid and fucoidan, sr-a ligands, arguing for a role of sr-a in entry of ebola viruses into macrophages."

pmc3817128,"this study demonstrates that g6pd-deficient epithelial cells are less tolerant to staphylococcus aureus infection due to impaired removal of reactive oxygen species  ros  and enhanced apoptotic activity. the study shows that the lack of glutathione peroxidase  gpx , encoded by the g6pd gene, impairs the reconversion of glutathione disulphide to reduced glutathione, leading to an inability to remove excess ros effectively. the study highlights that the accumulation of ros in mitochondria, where the majority of ros are generated, results in stronger cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway in g6pd-deficient cells. the study suggests that staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin, a major virulence factor of s. aureus, contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction through the accumulation of ros in g6pd-deficient cells. the study indicates that the misuse of antibiotics in other drug-resistant strains may trigger the expression of other exotoxins that can cause stronger oxidative stress in g6pd-deficient cells, although the susceptibility of different cell types to bacterial virulence factors is variable."

pmc3647029,"clostridium difficile, a food-borne pathogen, has been implicated in neonatal nec, sepsis, and meningitis. in gnotobiotic quails, strains of clostridium butyricum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile isolated from nec patients caused cecal lesions similar to those observed in nec, and nec did not occur if bifidobacteria were introduced along with clostridia. therefore, the latter acted as opportunistic pathogens. c. sakazakii, an emerging pathogen, has been implicated in neonatal nec, sepsis, and meningitis. in a well-established animal model, c. sakazakii caused intestinal inflammation, and its virulence was strain-specific. only 3 out of 24 strains induced barrier leakage, disrupted tight junctions, and induced enterocyte apoptosis. all of these three strains were of human origin, and strain-specific virulence may explain why the same microbial species may or may not cause the disease. in a study using a well-established animal model, a strain of k. pneumoniae caused nec in neonatal mice. development of nec in this model was dependent on chemical obliteration of the host's paneth cells, indicating that k. pneumoniae acted as an opportunistic pathogen. in a study using a well-established animal model, c. sakazakii, but not e. coli, at 105 cfu significantly increased the degree of intestinal inflammation, reported as nec pathologic grade. the effect of c. sakazakii was dose-dependent, and c. sakazakii did not invade enterocytes, but efficiently adhered to the epithelium in vivo and in vitro, causing enterocyte apoptosis and destruction of the villus tips. in a study examining the pathogenicity of c. sakazakii, it was demonstrated that the ability to cause epithelial damage in nec models is not a property of bacterial species as a whole, but rather a"

pmc2849577,"the present study identified canine herpesvirus type 1  chv  as the causative agent of a severe outbreak of canine infectious tracheobronchitis  itb  in a large animal medical center, with almost half of the dogs harboring latent chv infection. chv is a monotypic virus with a low level of antigenic and genomic divergence, making it challenging to differentiate between isolates. rflp analysis of genomic dna, using the endonucleases hindiii, xbai, and pvui, can help differentiate chv isolates from each other, with isolates from the same origin showing similar migration patterns. chv isolates from the present study showed virulence similar to, but rather less than, that of a chv strain isolated 30 years ago in japan from pups with fatal hemorrhagic syndrome. this finding lends support to the recent proposal that chv is a more significant pathogen than previously believed, especially when chv infection occurs among stressed dogs in a group. the serological survey conducted in the present study indicated that the dogs in the area of tokyo adjoining the hospital possess a higher prevalence of anti-chv antibodies than the dogs raised in the suburban areas of yamanashi or hokkaido. almost half of the dogs harbor latent chv infection, indicating that they may become immunosuppressed due to stress caused by hospitalization, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. the findings of the present study suggest that the number of immunosuppressed dogs was high enough to perpetuate transmission after the initial introduction of chv, making it challenging to control the spread of infection in a group, especially in large animal medical centers where canine itb occurs. vaccination, including inactivated vaccines available in europe to protect newborn pups from systemic infection, might be one of the choices applied to animals under such special circumstances."

pmc3147826,"the study found that respiratory viruses are common in asymptomatic children, particularly in infants, with a prevalence of 27% for respiratory syncytial virus  rsv  and 44% in infants younger than 1 year old. the study also found that while rsv was rarely detected in asymptomatic individuals, adenovirus  adv  and human metapneumovirus  hmpv  were frequently found in asymptomatic children. the study showed that for respiratory syncytial virus  rsv , rhinovirus  rv , influenza a virus  infa , and human coronavirus  hcov , median viral loads differed significantly between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. the study suggested that cutoff values for influenza a virus  infa  could easily be determined, as infa was the only virus for which no overlap was noted between viruses in symptomatic and asymptomatic children. the study highlighted the need for larger samples sizes in a variety of different patient groups to overcome challenges in determining clinically relevant cutoff values for infections with viruses that are also found frequently among controls, and to design reliable receiver operating characteristic  roc  curves for infections with viruses that are also found frequently among controls."
pmc4491039,"a study published in the journal of virology in 2021 reported that the administration of non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors, including cyclosporine a, deb025/alisprovir, and nim811, suppresses the de novo formation of double membrane vesicles, which serve as a compartment where viral rna replication occurs sheltered from innate cell sensors in human coronavirus  hcov  infection. the study also showed that viruses harboring deb025/alisprovir or nim811 are able to generate double membrane vesics in cyclophilin a knockdown cells, consistent with prior observations indicating that these substitutions in deb025/alisprovir or nim811 obviate the need for cyclophilin a binding and ppiase catalysis, leading to a cyclophilin a independent phenotype. for hcov, cyclophilin a, in concert with deb025/alisprovir or nim811, plays a highly specific and potentially singular role in the replication cycle by regulating the biogenesis of membranous web formation. the role of cyclophilins in coronavirus infection remains to be understood, but recent reports have demonstrated that the dependence on cyclophilins of distinct viruses for various steps of replication such as viral entry, formation of protective membranous compartments, rna synthesis and multiplication, viral genome uncoating, nuclear import, and nuclear entry, emphasizes the potential of cyclophilin inhibitors as a therapeutic agent. the neutralization of cyclophilin a with cyclosporine a or nim811 inhibits the replication of human cytomegalovirus  hcmv , human papillomavirus  hpv , and dengue flaviviruses  denv . the apparent dependence of distinct viruses on cyclophilins for various steps of replication suggests that cyclophilin inhibitors could be exploited as a first-line of protection against new and emerging viruses."
pmc6895754,"this study found that all six common respiratory viruses, including civ, cpiv, cadv-2, cahv-1, crcov, and cvd, were detected in both cai and hai dogs, suggesting that these viruses are already circulating in both environments. co-infections with civ and crcov, the most commonly detected viruses, were frequently found with themselves or other viruses in both study groups, indicating that these viruses may act either as primary or secondary agents in co-infections. the clinical severity of cirdc infection was related to the age of the affected dogs, with puppies having a more severe clinical level compared to dogs in other age groups. there was no significant difference in the types of cird-associated viruses between cai and hai groups, except for cvd, which was more associated with cai dogs. the high detection rate of civ, crcov, and cahv-1 suggests the need for further consideration of an appropriate vaccination regimen. furthermore, the relationship between age and clinical severity highlights the importance of considering age as a factor in managing respiratory diseases in dogs."

pmc1866046,"the nsp1 protein of sars-cov, encoded at the 5' terminus of the viral genome, forms a previously unknown, complex β-barrel fold with several unique structural features. this fold is characterized by an irregular β-barrel geometry, distorted β-sheets, and a unique arrangement of the linker polypeptide segments between adjacent β-sheets. the nsp1 protein contains a positively charged surface patch, which may mediate specific as well as nonspecific intermolecular interactions by electrostatic forces. this patch is formed by lysine residues 48, 125, and 126, which are conserved in the mhv nsp1 protein but not in the p9 nsp1 proteins of group 1 coronaviruses. the nsp1 protein promotes mrna degradation, but the mhv nsp1 protein, which is homologous to nsp1 of sars-cov, also causes cell cycle arrest in cultured cells. the most striking result of the alignment of sars-cov nsp1 with the polypeptide fragment consisting of residues 46 to 247 of mhv nsp1 is the observation of a consensus sequence, lrkxgxkg, positioned at the end of strand β6 of the globular domain of sars-cov nsp1, which is conserved not only in mhv nsp1 but also in human cov oc43 nsp1. the nsp1 protein of sars-cov lacks residues corresponding to arginine 110 and leucine 111 of mhv nsp1, which were identified as a potential cyclin-binding motif by chen et al.  2010 . in addition, residues 30 to 33  ser/asn  of mhv nsp1, which occur in an n-terminal 45-residue segment, were identified as a potential site for phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases  cdks   chen et al., 2010 . these residues occur in an n-termin"

pmc3592061,"the study utilized a novel diagnostic platform, called the gis pathchip, which combines microfluidics, dna nanoballoon technology, and a silicon nanopore array to simultaneously identify and enumerate multiple respiratory viruses in clinical samples. the gis pathchip was able to detect a wide range of viruses, including human bocavirus, human parechovirus, rotavirus, influenza c virus, and poliovirus, which were not identified by the traditional methods of culture, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. the gis pathchip was also able to accurately classify enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, which is typically beyond the scope of traditional specific primer polymerase chain reaction assays. the study found that the gis pathchip detected coinfecting viruses in almost 30% of the samples, highlighting the complex nature of respiratory viral infections. the study suggests that the use of this technology for the detection and identification of viruses in the respiratory tract is now a viable option, as it offers high sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of commercially available and fda-licensed respiratory pathogen panels."

pmc6438514,"sulfonated poly allylamine -based polymers, specifically ι-carrageenan and nspah-15-94, demonstrate a dose-dependent inhibition of human metapneumovirus  hmpv  replication with comparable antiviral properties to carrageenans, but with better physicochemical properties. studies on the mechanism of antiviral properties of these polymers suggest that the decrease in infectivity is due to blocking virus release from cellular membranes. these developed synthetic polymers are not toxic and offer similar antiviral properties as carrageenans but show better physicochemical properties. in a previous work, nspahs were reported to hamper influenza virus replication in vitro and in vivo and are believed to be broad-spectrum drug candidates competitive to marketed compounds. the authors suggest that further studies on the mechanism of antiviral properties of these polymers may reveal that the difference in nspahs activity between hmpv and human coronavirus nl63 results from different requirements for the presence of host shutoff protein  hsp  s, but it would not explain strong inhibitory effect of nspahs against the influenza virus."
pmc6738265,"intranasal injection of fmomv, a complex of various toll-like receptor  tlr  ligands, provides broad-spectrum protection against diverse influenza virus strains, as early as 3 days after administration, by eliciting activation of macrophages and inducing antiviral molecular milieu in the lungs. fmomv injection leads to an increase and activation of macrophages, resulting in the recruitment of bone marrow-derived macrophages to the lungs, and these macrophages are indispensable for the antiviral effect of fmomv, as they suppress viral replication after influenza virus infection. fmomv injection induces the secretion of cytokines, such as interleukin  il -1β and type i interferons  ifns , in the lung tissue, and these cytokines play an important role in the protection against influenza virus infection by both inhibiting viral replication and suppressing excessive tissue inflammation. fmomv injection does not require neutrophils for antiviral activities provided by fmomv, as infiltrated macrophages have sufficiently suppressed disease severity after influenza virus infection, and viral load and inflammatory cytokines may have been insufficient to activate neutrophils to produce antiviral molecules after influenza virus infection in fmomv-injected mice. fmomv, a complex of various tlr ligands, leads to higher protective efficacy against diverse influenza virus strains, as it presumably simultaneously activates tlrs and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, whereas a single tlr ligand or simultaneous activation of tlr2 and tlr9 provides differential protective efficacy against different virus strains."

pmc4403407,"mers-cov induces significantly higher secretion of type i interferons  ifns  in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells  pdscs  compared to sars-cov. the onset of viral gene expression in human pdscs is crucial for mers-cov entry into pdscs via the endosomal route, and chloroquine-mediated inhibition of ifn production by pdscs after contact with mers-cov argues for receptor-mediated endocytosis of viral particles and activation of mers-cov spike proteins by endosomal proteases, finally resulting in cytosolic entry of mers-cov across the endosomal membrane. dpp4 is described as an activating receptor on t lymphocytes  t cells , but its function in dendritic cells  dcs  has thus far been linked only to t cell stimulation. the absence of functional entry receptors in mice leads to lack of ifn production in murine cells, and mers-cov-induced ifn secretion is strongly inhibited by blocking dpp4 with recombinant viral spike proteins. the release of type i and iii ifns may protect against mers-cov-induced pathogenicity, but clinically recorded mers patients having a worse prognosis than sars patients, and the severity of illness correlates with large amounts of inflammatory cytokines in serum, suggesting immune-mediated pathogenesis being potentially one factor for the higher mortality rate observed in mers patients."

pmc6088748,"the concept of cryptic sites in proteins, which are binding pockets that are not detected in unbound structures but become apparent upon ligand binding, has gained significant attention in recent years due to the potential of identifying new drug targets. the casp  critical assessment of structure prediction  experiment, which challenges the community to predict protein structures based on amino acid sequences, has revealed that the majority of proteins have ligand-binding pockets that are cryptic in the unbound state. a rigorous definition of cryptic sites requires the selection of an ensemble of unbound structures to consider, as some proteins may have different conformations in different unbound structures. many cryptic sites are druggable, with around 80% of proteins in a set of 4857 having known high-affinity ligands binding at cryptic sites. allosteric sites, which are frequently identified as cryptic, have become increasingly important as drug targets due to the ability to bind several substrates or to exclude bulk water from the active site. the expansion of existing pockets by larger ligands is a very interesting but largely unsolved problem, as it can lead to the identification of additional binding sites. molecular dynamics simulations can identify prospective cryptic sites, but their results require further validation to distinguish between transient pockets that are most likely not druggable and those that are. the combined use of residue physico-chemical properties, pocket shape, sequence conservation, and fragment docking as features in a machine learning algorithm is recommended for reliable cryptic site prediction. the analysis of protein structures with validated cryptic sites shows that among the pockets that are seen to open during molecular dynamics simulations, only one or two may be capable of binding a ligand with substantial affinity. the opening of cryptic sites is usually due to changes only in side chain conformations, and such sites typically have low ligand binding affinity."

pmc3405761,"in the context of predicting the spread of a fungal infection in a population of agar dots, the authors found that the method of effective transmissibility, which assumes that epidemics can be approximately described by a constant transmissivity over time, gives reliable predictions for invasion, even for a single realization of an epidemic. this method is more robust than those based on supposedly more precise methods, which infer data that are not directly available from observations. the authors also showed that the method gives reliable predictions in the presence of spatial heterogeneity in the transmission of infection. in the context of predicting the spread of a fungal infection in a population of agar dots, the authors found that the method of effective transmissivity is applicable to cases where hosts are placed on more complex networks, as long as the rate of change of the configuration of contacts is much smaller than the removal rate of hosts. they also suggested a possible strategy to extend the ideas presented in this paper to deal with epidemics with persistence, where immunity after recovery is not permanent, and to predict the stationary prevalence of infection in such networks. in the context of predicting the spread of a fungal infection in a population of agar dots, the authors found that the method of effective transmissivity can also be successfully applied to cases where the transmissility changes over time, as long as it remains within the bounds for the effective transmissivity estimated from observations. they also suggested characterizing the final state of epidemics in terms of the mean number of removed  i.e. ever infected  hosts, nr, instead of the probability of invasion, pinv, in cases where hosts are placed on more complex networks. in the context of predicting the spread of a fungal infection in a population of agar dots, the authors found that the prediction horizon, beyond which the uncertainty of predictions of the evolution of the epidemic is too large for predictions to be useful, is epidemic-dependent and also depends on how precise we want our predictions to be. they also suggested that different replicates of epidemics with given t will follow different evolutions that have a prediction horizon but will lead to the same pinv or nr [26,30,31].

pmc3840586,"the use of iota-carrageenan nasal spray in patients with common cold symptoms results in a significant reduction in viral load in nasal fluids, as well as a faster reduction of symptoms and shorter duration of disease. intranasal treatment with carrageenan nasal spray is safe and well tolerated, with appropriate dosage being essential for clinical effectiveness. patients with common cold symptoms who received iota-carrageenan nasal spray had shorter duration of disease and faster reduction of symptoms compared to those treated with a placebo nasal spray. early intervention with carrageenan nasal spray results in significant clinical effectiveness for viral infections of the upper respiratory tract known as the common cold. appropriate dosage and early intervention are suggested for optimal clinical effectiveness with iota-carrageenan nasal spray."
pmc3699609,"the realamp method, a rapid real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of a. baumannii, was developed by using an esi-quant tube scanner and was shown to be a potential tool for field use as a result of its high sensitivity and specificity, rapidity, lower contamination rate, and easy standardization. the realamp method was at least 10-fold more sensitive than the conventional polymerase chain reaction  pcr  assay and was able to differentiate between a. baumannii and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, which are grouped together as the ac-ab complex due to their considerable epidemiological and clinically relevant differences. the realamp method was also able to detect a. baumannii isolates, which would not be affected by biochemical reactions, as the slower rate of metabolism of a. baumannii could cause weaker fluorescent biochemical reactions in the reaction wells of the vitek 2 system id-gnb cards, leading to more discrepant identifications with the vitek 2 system. the realamp method was able to detect a. baumannii isolates, which would not be affected by biochemical reactions, as the targets for detection are representative sequences from the pathogens, alive or dead, and culture-based assays, on the other hand, detect all living bacterial cells grown in the culture media. the realamp method will be more attractive for field use if the realamp reagents can be made into dry powder and stored at room temperature without requiring a cold chain, as this would make the realamp method more convenient for use in basic healthcare settings."
pmc5321269,"the study found that treatment with interferon beta-1a  ifnβ-1a  for ebola virus disease  evd  may be associated with clearance of virus from blood, better clinical features, and potentially improved survival. the study also reported a decrease in the incidence of asthenia in ifnβ-1a-treated patients compared to historic controls receiving supportive care only. the study found that ifnβ-1a treatment may improve the frequency of symptoms associated with evd, such as hemorrhage, vertigo, and epigastralgia. the study reported that ifnβ-1a treatment may result in a faster decline in viral load and a shorter duration of fever compared to historic controls. the study noted that the ifnβ-1a-treated patients had a lower risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  and a lower case fatality ratio  cfr  compared to historic controls."
pmc3754627,"the study found that the most frequently detected viruses in respiratory samples were human rhinovirus/enterovirus  hrv/ev , respiratory syncytial virus  rsv , and human coronavirus  hcov . hrv/ev, rsv, and hcov were also the most common viruses in immunosuppressed patients, with hcov being the second most commonly detected virus in this population. in hcov-positive immunosuppressed patients, clinical manifestations of lower respiratory tract infection  lrti  were more frequently observed in association with hrv/ev, rsv, and other respiratory viruses or noninfectious respiratory diseases, suggesting the involvement of possible associated pathogens or noninfectious respiratory diseases before attributing the unique etiology of an lrti to hcov. the study highlighted that respiratory viruses exhibit different association patterns during multiple infections, suggesting complex relationships that might occur between respiratory viruses and their host in the respiratory tract. the study found that a unique preferential codetection was observed between the hcov subtypes 229e and hcov-hku1, but for all other statistically significant pairs of viruses, viral cosuppression was common."
pmc5711319,"in countries with a high burden of zoonotic diseases, such as those with a high prevalence of diseases transmitted by food animals, effective prevention and control strategies must take into account the economic importance of these animals to communities that are economically dependent on them. prioritization of zoonotic diseases for prevention and control should consider the potential negative economic effects on the food supply, such as with avian and swine influenza viruses, in addition to the burden of disease in humans and animals. accurate estimation of the burden of zoonotic diseases is critical for identifying public- and animal-health priorities and assessing the impact of prevention and control strategies, including potential economic effects on the food supply. effective zoonotic disease surveillance and response systems should involve timely and effective communication and collaboration between relevant sectors and stakeholders, such as those in human, animal, and environmental health. early detection and response to zoonotic disease outbreaks should consider the potential negative economic effects on the food supply and the need for effective biosecurity measures, while also prioritizing prevention and control strategies for diseases with potential animal reservoirs."
pmc4118806,"the authors successfully crystallized the hcov-nl63 main protease in complex with the michael acceptor n3, which belongs to space group p41212 with two molecules per asymmetric unit. the authors identified two molecules per asymmetric unit in the crystals, corresponding to a matthews coefficient and solvent content of 3.06 å³3 da−1 and 59.8%, respectively. the authors initially attempted to crystallize the apo-form of hcov-nl63 main protease but faced challenges with most crystals cracking. the authors turned to an alternative method to co-crystallize the protease with the michael acceptor n3, which resulted in the successful crystallization of the protein complex. further structural and functional analysis of the hcov-nl63 main protease in complex with the michael acceptor n3 will lead to better design and optimization of this lead drug against hcov-nl63-associated diseases."
pmc6180237,"the study found that zika virus  zikv  infection during pregnancy can lead to fetal malformations, as four out of six cases with villous immaturity  observed in hematoxylin and eosin staining and morphometric analysis  were associated with congenital disorders caused by zikv infection. the study revealed that human placental samples from women infected with zikv at different gestational periods showed zikv-positive fetal hofbauer cells  hfcs  in the placenta, regardless of the period at which infection occurred, suggesting that zikv can persist in the placenta for several months after maternal infection and may provide a viral source for continued fetal infection. the study found that hofbauer cells  hfcs  are the most frequently observed infected cells, as they were detected in placental samples from six cases of zikv infection in pregnant women. the study showed that hofbauer cells  hfcs  are the only zikv-positive fetal cells in the placenta, as zikv genomic material and viral particles were detected in placental cells until the end of pregnancy, regardless of the trimester in which infection occurred. the study suggested that the most plausible hypothesis for the transplacental transmission of zikv would be related to its association with hfcs and its migratory ability to reach the fetal vessels and then infect the fetus either by transcytosis or through zikv-infected ""trojan horse"" cells."
pmc3953859,"inhalation of nitric oxide  no  and induction of cyclic guanosine monophosphate  cgmp  by guanylyl cyclase  gc  agonists, such as glyceryl trinitrate, attenuates sepsis-induced systemic hypotension, lung injury, and multiple organ dysfunctions in conscious rats and isolated lungs [1,2]. exercise training in conscious rats reduces sepsis-induced systemic hypotension, lung injury, and inflammation, and restores lung compliance and gas exchange [64]. propofol, a sedative and hypnotic anesthetic agent, improves pulmonary and organ functions following lipopolysaccharide  lps  administration and reduces cell apoptosis caused by deforoxamine-induced hypoxia [66,159]. n-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant and cytoprotective agent, prevents lung injury caused by fat and air embolism and lps, and reduces nitrate/nitrite, tumor necrosis factor-alpha  tnf-α , and interleukin-1 beta  il-1β  [98,160,161]. insulin exerts anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing activities of nuclear factor-kappa b  nf-κb  and activator protein 1, and reducing expression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, attenuating lipopolysaccharide  lps -induced lung injury and associated biochemical changes [62,68]."
pmc2613559,"mvtt-s, a replication-competent vaccinia vector, offers greater advantage than mva-s for inducing high levels of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov through mucosal vaccination. mvtt-s induces higher levels of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov in animals vaccinated via intranasal or intranasal/intranasal-oral  i.n./i.o.  routes compared to mva-s, even with a sub-optimal dose. mvtt-s can overcome the pre-existing immune response to wild-type vaccinia through s.c. vaccination, allowing for the induction of higher levels of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov through mucosal vaccination. the replication-competent nature of mvtt allows for a minimized dose of vaccine, reducing the manufacturing burden and making the vaccine cost-effective. mucosal vaccination with mvtt-s offers great advantages for inducing protective immune responses at mucosal sites of viral transmission and dissemination, making it an attractive live viral vector for the development of future mucosal vaccines."
pmc4199241,"the cotton rat, a small mammal, hosts infection with human rhinovirus  hrv  type 16 and exhibits measurable pathology, mucus production, and expression of inflammatory mediators. intranasal infection with hrv16 results in the production of low levels of neutralizing antibodies that confer reduced protection against re-challenge, while intramuscular immunization with live hrv16 results in strong type-specific protection that correlates with high levels of systemic neutralizing antibodies. passive transfer of antibodies generated in vaccinated cotton rats can protect naïve animals from pulmonary infection, demonstrating that the cotton rat is a suitable animal model for challenge studies to explore the development of anti-rhinovirus vaccines and anti-viral therapies. maternal immunization with hrv16 in cotton rats results in complete protection against intranasal challenge in newborn pups, and passive transfer of maternal antibodies is also effective, with a neutralizing antibody titer of 320 being sufficient for a 2 log10 reduction in viral load in the lung. the cotton rat model provides strong evidence that the parenteral route of immunization can be effective in the context of hrv infection, highlighting the large potential of the cotton rat to provide an experimental platform complementary to that offered by mouse models for further evaluation of antibody-based strategies to support new developments in this area."
pmc4882208,"a review of the effect of warm weather showed a strong correlation between high temperatures or humidity and the use of medical care during hajj. more than 1000 deaths from heatstroke were reported in 2000, and more than 18,000 people needing treatment in emergency departments for heat exhaustion during summertime hajj. heat-related mortality and morbidity are preventable, with the risk of heat-related death increased in older individuals and those with pre-existing cardiovascular, pulmonary, and psychiatric disorders. prevention measures include using sun protection equipment's, drinking adequate rehydration solution, avoiding prolonged exposure to heat during hajj activities, and using fans, cooling buses, places, and accommodation. over the history of hajj, there have been several large crowd disasters, including a tent fire in miná in 1975, which killed 200 pilgrims, and two bombs that exploded in 1989, killing 16 pilgrims. these incidents have led to efforts to solve crowd difficulties by scientific means, such as crowd simulation models, video monitoring, and changes in the construction of the transport system for hajj. as a result, no stampedes have been reported since 2006. the annual hajj pilgrimage, which attracts approximately 3 million pilgrims during 1 week, presents a unique challenge for emergency medicine training programs due to the high acuity of emergencies and the multicultural background of the pilgrims. residents in saudi arabian emergency medicine programs are required to complete a one-month hajj rotation, during which they gain exposure to all kinds of emergencies, both traumatic and medical, as well as to pre-hospital care intervention and evacuation planning. research is critical to develop planning, risk management, crowded management, and policies and guidelines to identify issues and possible solutions. the hajj research center in mecca annually conducts research and submits recommendations to the high authority of hajj for evaluation. the review article confirms that hajj is the oldest and largest mass gathering in human history, and the size of the gathering has a significant impact on health response. the population is diverse, and health facilities are limited around hajj"
pmc4151778,"the study identified two distinct receptor-binding domains  rbds  in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 viruses  the original rbd, which binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ace2 , and a second rbd, which binds to bat ace2 orthologs. the researchers found that a previously uncharacterized bat ace2 ortholog, bat ace2b, can also serve as a functional receptor for sars-cov-2 viruses, but with lower affinity compared to the ortholog from the horse shrew  rhinolophus ferrumequinum  or chinese horseshoe bat  rhinolophus sinensis . the study showed that the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2, but not that of sars-cov, can be cleaved by transmembrane serine protease 2  tmprss2  expressed in human airway epithelial cells, which is a prerequisite for efficient virus entry into human cells. the researchers found that the spike protein of sars-cov-2, but not that of sars-cov, can be cleaved by cathepsin l  ctl  in human cells, which is another prerequisite for efficient virus entry into human cells. the study demonstrated that a human ace2-overexpressing cell line is permissive to infection by sars-cov-2 viruses, but not by sars-cov viruses, and that this cell line supports efficient replication of sars-cov-2 viruses."
pmc6074883,"mers-cov is a highly pathogenic emerging respiratory virus that has caused a small but lethal epidemic centered in saudi arabia but capable of limited person-to-person spread. mers-cov is a betacoronavirus, most closely related to several bat coronaviruses but probably transmitted by some still unidentified intermediate animal host. mers-cov produces severe and progressive pneumonia, frequently accompanied by renal failure, and affects preferentially older adults with underlying illness, although younger individuals and children have also been infected. mers-cov causes a range of illnesses, from asymptomatic infection to pneumonia with respiratory failure, and has been fatal in about half of all recorded infections. epidemiological human and animal investigations are required to find and identify the animal reservoir s  that either directly or indirectly transmits the virus to humans."
pmc4138011,"the study demonstrates the application of recombinase polymerase amplification  rpa  for rapid and sensitive detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex  mtbc  in sputum samples. two assays targeting separate repetitive elements were examined, both demonstrating the ability to detect mtbc dna with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in less than 20 minutes. both assays had high sensitivity  100%  with isolates that were smear and culture positive. the positive predictive value  ppv  and negative predictive value  npv  were not presented as the composition of the mtbc screening panels used in this study were selected to demonstrate proof of concept and do not reflect the normal distribution of specimens received for routine screening of pulmonary mtbc infection. the study highlights the potential of rpa as a tool for point-of-care diagnostics, as the comparatively low isothermal incubation temperature combined with rapid time to result allows rpa to be used with a battery-powered device, making it amenable to health clinics in developing countries that do not have reliable electricity supply. further studies are required to adapt sample extraction methodology for use at the point of care. the study notes that whereas 0.5 ml inoculum was used for culture, the volume taken for dna extraction was only 0.25 ml, with just 5 μl being used for each rpa assay. the study suggests that improved sample handling and dna extraction may improve detection from complex sample matrices such as sputum. the study notes that to fulfil the full potential of rpa for point-of-care diagnostics, an integrated platform to perform sample preparation and run the assay must be developed. the study notes that the number of negative samples included in this study were insufficient to assess the clinical specificity and the number of culture-positive, smear-negative samples should be increased to better determine the clinical sensitivity."
pmc6777354,"the study identified four major clusters of the gii.p17-gii.17 virus, with strains belonging to clusters 1 and 3 containing no unique phenotypic features due to mutations, while strains belonging to clusters 2 and 4 exhibited unique amino acid substitutions in proteins p48, p22, protease, rdrp, and vp2. the study revealed that the gii.p17-gii.17 virus has evolved differently to gii.p4-gii.4, with potential to alter antigenicity, host-binding capability  i.e., hbga , and genome replication efficiency, which could recurrently generate variants of gii.17 with the potential to produce pandemics such as those caused by gii.4 variant strains. the study showed that the gii.p17-gii.17 virus has a lower evolutionary rate than gii.p4, possibly due to differences in replication activities and/or in replication errors of the rdrp protein. the study found that the gii.p17-gii.17 virus contains amino acid substitutions in residues adjacent to the interface between monomers in the rdrp structure, which may affect the stability of the dimer and its rna binding abilities. the study revealed that the gii.p17-gii.17 virus has evolved differently to gii.p4-gii.4, with strains belonging to clusters 1 and 4 having unique amino acid substitutions in rdrp, protease, rdrp, and vp2 proteins, which were found only in miyagi prefecture in japan during short periods and was never detected in other areas, possibly because these mutations are deleterious to the propagations of the virus."

pmc4855837,"the highly contagious porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  pedv  major immunogenic determinant is the spike glycoprotein  s , which is crucial in inducing neutralizing antibodies against pedv. two different fragments of s protein were cloned and expressed as glutathione s-transferase  gst -tagged fusion proteins  rgst-coe and rgst-s1d  in e. coli, but their expression resulted in inclusion bodies using various expression vectors, strains, and induction conditions. co-expression of trigger factor  tf  with recombinant proteins at 15°c was most helpful in achieving soluble production of rgst-coe and rgst-s1d compared to other chaperone co-expression systems. purified proteins were detected by western blot using mouse anti-gst mab and pig anti-pedv immune sera, and immunization of mice with these proteins elicited highly potent serum igg and serum neutralizing antibody titers. soluble production of pedv s protein antigens, rgst-coe and rgst-s1d, was achieved by co-expressing chaperones, which suggests their potential use as subunit vaccine antigens."
pmc2443186,"the study found that the frequency of reports about particular pathogens is related not to their associated morbidity or mortality impact, but rather to the direct or potential economic and social disruption caused by the outbreak. the study found that over the evaluation time period, 174 countries had reports of infectious disease outbreaks, with the greatest reporting from the united states, the united kingdom, canada, and china. the study found that there was a clear bias towards increased reporting from countries with higher numbers of media outlets, more developed public health resources, and greater availability of electronic communication infrastructure. the study found that the system characterizes disease outbreak reports by means of a series of text mining algorithms, including identifying disease and location, determining relevance, and grouping similar reports together while removing exact duplicates. the study found that the system generates meta-alerts of disease outbreaks by calculating a composite activity score based on the reliability of the data source and the number of unique data sources, with increased weight to multiple types of information and conflict resolution."
pmc6937193,"this study, which used 16s rrna pyrosequencing to analyze adenoid samples in patients with otitis media with and without adenoid hyperplasia, identified a difference in bacterial diversity and microbial composition between the two groups. the results suggest that changes in the microbiota may be associated with the development of otitis media. the microbial composition at the phylum level was slightly different between the two groups, with actinobacteria identified in the ome group as highly dominant only in one specimen  61.75% . this is noteworthy because actinobacteria are difficult to identify using conventional culture methods, and their roles in the human body have not yet been studied. the four dominant species in the ome group were strains that were rarely cultured in a traditional culture-based study, including delftia, corynebacterium, and streptococcus dysgalactiae. this is different from what was observed in a traditional culture-based study of adenoids. in addition, the non-dominant microbiomes detected in the adenoids of the control group varied from study to study, possibly due to differences in race and age, as well as environmental factors. the results of the sequence similarity-based analysis study, such as pcoa and upgma tree analysis, revealed differences in microbial composition between the ome and control groups. this provides basic data for identifying a new pathologic mechanism and will aid in the treatment of otitis media."

pmc6440764,"in a study published in bmc infectious diseases, a molecular diagnostic assay for measuring the viral load of measles virus  mv  in respiratory specimens and urine was developed and validated. the assay targets the highly conserved l gene and the variable h gene, allowing for simultaneous quantitation and differentiation of wild-type and vaccine-related strains. the assay was found to be sensitive for all listed global circulating genotypes, including genotypes a, b3, and d8, which are the most widely distributed types. it was less than 10 copies/reaction for all genotypes except genotype d8 using the h gene probe, but the sensitivity for genotype d8 using the l gene probe was 2 copies/reaction, which is operationally significant due to the high viral load in an infected individual in the prodromal phase or in an individual with a rash presentation for up to 10 days. the assay provides immediate differentiation between vaccine and wild-type strains with a high degree of certainty, which is critical due to the high infectivity of wild-type mv. the operational value of this assay is the high sensitivity for all the listed circulating global genotypes coupled with the immediate differentiation between vaccine and wild-type strains with a high degree of certainty, which allows for optimal management. in canada and the united states, only the schwarz or moraten strain is used in measles-containing vaccines, respectively, which makes the rapid identification or exclusion of the schwarz or moraten strain, along with the patient's history, crucial for optimal management. however, in the context of samples tested at the provincial laboratory, the finding that one limitation of the snp assay is that it is specific for the schwarz or moraten strain would not identify other vaccine strains, such as zagreb or shanghai-191, and differentiate them from wild-type strains, is less relevant due to the fact that the provincial laboratory has yet to encounter a case vaccinated outside of canada, and the snp assay would classify it as genotype a, which is likely of vaccine origin, as wild-type genotype a strains no longer circulate."

pmc6081077,"the study found that the annual primary total knee arthroplasty  tka  rate increased by 202.56% in taiwan from 1996 to 2010, with a higher rate in women. the study showed that the annual primary tka rate presented a rising tendency with increases in patient age, similar to other studies in western countries and the asian area, with a high rate in the 70 to 79 age group. the study revealed that the mean age of patients undergoing tka has risen, and advances in medical management of osteoarthritis  oa  may mean patients postpone joint replacement surgery, leading to an incremental rise in the mean age of patients receiving tka. the study found that the annual incidence rate of tka was higher in women than in men, with a ratio of 2.5 to 3 times larger in taiwan, slightly greater than that of previous studies in western countries and the asian area. the study demonstrated that the alos for tka markedly declined from 1996 to 2010, with a small peak in the cost and the mean length of stay for tka in 1999, and the mean cost per patient and alos also fell slowly from 1996 to 2010, possibly due to advances in medical technology and sciences."
pmc5787871,"the study describes two patients with mirage syndrome, a recently identified form of congenital adrenal insufficiency caused by mutations in the samd9 gene. one patient presented with mirage syndrome at birth, while the other developed it after undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation for myelodysplastic syndrome. both patients had severe complications, including myelodysplastic syndrome, infection, restricted growth, adrenal hypoplasia, and enteropathy. the study found that the mirage syndrome mutation identified in the second patient, c.2920g>a; p.e974k, had not been previously reported. both patients also experienced complications related to their underlying mirage syndrome, including temperature instability, enteropathy, and a predisposition to bacteremia. the study highlights the challenges of using allogeneic stem cell transplantation to treat patients with severe mirage syndrome phenotypes, as both patients in this study died of posttransplant complications, despite engraftment. the study suggests that careful consideration of the benefits and risks of allogeneic stem cell transplantation is warranted in patients with severe mirage syndrome phenotypes, even with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, and families should be aware of the potential for a protracted and particularly arduous post-transplant course. the study underscores the need for new specialized approaches for managing multiorgan complications of mirage syndrome, particularly for patients with underlying adrenal insufficiency."
pmc5083078,"acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  copd  are associated with significant declines in pulmonary function, increased mortality, and high healthcare costs. rapid-acting bronchodilators, such as albuterol, are effective in managing acute exacerbations of copd. systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone, can reduce the frequency and severity of copd exacerbations and prevent hospitalization in patients with moderate-to-severe copd. long-term antibiotic use, such as azithromycin, can reduce the frequency of copd exacerbations in patients with a history of exacerbation in the previous year. prevention of copd exacerbations should be a key component of copd management, and recent guidelines emphasize strategies such as smoking cessation, vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal disease, and long-term antibiotic use in patients with a history of exacerbation in the previous year."
pmc2957079,"coronaviruses encode accessory proteins and nucleocapsid  n  and replicase-associated nonstructural protein 1  nsp1  and nsp3 that inhibit interferon  ifn  induction and signaling, leading to immune evasion. ifn is detected in mhv-infected mice and humans with sars, but cell type-specific differences in ifn expression after coronavirus infection exist. ifn is induced in macrophages and microglia via mda5-dependent pathways, and oligodendrocyte cell lines via mda5- and rig-i-dependent pathways. infection of dendritic cells  dcs  and macrophages contributes to the development of effective innate and adaptive immune responses, but macrophage infection can also lead to immunopathological disease and enhanced lethality. most ifn produced after mhv infection is dependent on signaling through the ifn-α/β receptor  ifnar , and ifn is critical for virus-induced upregulation of ifn-related molecules, including mda5, rig-i, and cxcl10."
pmc4661038,"the human α-defensin, rtd-1, inhibits the secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor  tnf -α, interleukin  il -1β, il-6, il-8, and chemokines ccl3 and ccl5, both in vitro and in vivo. rtd-1 suppresses the activation of nuclear factor kappa b  nf-κb , the master regulator of inflammation, in human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide  lps , a potent inducer of nf-κb, and in lps-stimulated mouse macrophages through the toll-like receptor  tlr  1/2 and 4. rtd-1 inhibits the phosphorylation of several signaling kinases, including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase  mapk , c-jun n-terminal kinase  jnk  mapk, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase  erk 2, all of which are implicated in inflammatory signaling pathways. rtd-1 stimulates the phosphorylation of protein kinase b  akt , which is a known negative regulator of nf-κb and mapk pathways, and inhibits the degradation of iκbα, a key regulator of nf-κb activation, in lps-stimulated human monocytes. the anti-inflammatory properties of rtd-1 are distinct from those of human α-defensins and human β-defensin-3, as rtd-1 inhibits tnf secretion from stimulated blood cells differently from human α-defensins, suggesting that θ-defensin isoforms may be unique tools for dissecting regulatory pathways that determine whether the host response to inflammatory stimuli results in health or disease."
pmc6659456,"the study found that the cxcl5/cxcr2 axis promotes the progression of acute lung injury  ali , as evidenced by the observation that the expression of cxcl5 was significantly increased in lps-induced ali and that neutralization of cxcl5 reduced the release of inflammatory factors, pulmonary edema, and lung pathological changes, thereby alleviating lps-induced ali. the study also demonstrated that cxcr2, a g-protein-coupled receptor, is involved in the regulation of inflammatory neutrophil recruitment in ali, and its expression is directly proportional to the severity of ali. in addition to cxcl5, the study found that the expression of mmp2 and mmp9, which are involved in alis, was increased in lps-induced ali, and their overexpression exacerbated the progression of ali, partly by upregulation of inflammatory factors. the study revealed that the cxcl5/cxcr2 axis accelerates the progression of ali, partly by upregulation of mmp2 and mmp9 in lung tissues with the release of inflammatory factors. these findings could result in new therapeutic options against ali in the future, as the study suggests that targeting the cxcl5/cxcr2 axis and mmp2/mmp9 overexpression could alleviate ali."
pmc2481550,"lymphopenia-induced homeostatic proliferation leads to a reduction in cd4 t cells, which is associated with a narrowed t cell repertoire. the narrowed t cell repertoire in lymphopenic hosts can impair heterologous immune responses to secondary viral challenges, as demonstrated by reduced cd8 t cell responses to the normally immunodominant but not cross-reactive pv np-38 epitope in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus  lcmv -immune hosts challenged with poxvirus  pv . the narrowed t cell repertoire in lymphopenic hosts can lead to altered t cell usage of heterologous virus-encoded epitopes, as shown by the predominant use of vbeta5.1/5.2-positive t cells in heterologous immune responses to secondary pv challenges in lcmv-immune hosts. despite the narrowed t cell repertoire, lymphopenic hosts can mount effective cd8 t cell responses against both primary and secondary viral challenges, as demonstrated by the restoration of cd8 t cell numbers to normal levels after lcmv infection in lymphopenic hosts. the effect of a narrowed immune repertoire occurring as a consequence of homeostatic proliferation may be of greater significance in older persons in whom the thymus is functioning poorly, as the host experiences infections with additional viruses due to reduced thymic output."
pmc2825776,"in the punctuated scenario, there is little warning of adaptation as the majority of introductions go extinct without transmission. only 0.16% of outbreaks exceed two cases. in the gradual scenario, there is a broader range of cluster sizes before emergence due to the state marginally below pandemic capability  r0 = 0.9 . a pathogen with gradually increasing fitness and an adaptive stage marginally below pandemic capability is most likely to signal ongoing adaptation by causing large but self-limiting outbreaks. if a pathogen causes many hundreds of cases yet fails to show any sustained human transmission, it does not necessarily mean that the pathogen is incapable of adapting for human transmission. even in the punctuated scenario, emergence can occur without any prior signs of increasing fitness. the first 100 cases without emergence indicate a very low probability of emergence per introduction. beyond this point, continuing failed cases give little more information about the adaptability of the pathogen. a simple non-parametric method for detection of emergence that does not rely on knowledge of the reproductive fitness parameters is suggested. the double approach, which additionally monitors the daily incidence, shows an appreciably better performance in sensitivity, more consistently, than the single approach, while causing some specificity."

pmc2870680,"for highly contagious influenza strains, the size of the epidemic does not depend on heterogeneity in the degree distribution if no intervention is performed. this is due to the fact that major epidemics occur in more than 99% of simulations, regardless of whether infection is predominantly transmitted via close or casual contacts. for moderately contagious influenza strains, the size of the epidemic depends on heterogeneity in the degree distribution, even in the absence of interventions. the average number of infections increases from approximately 1000 when the variance is low to approximately 3000 when the standard deviation  s.d.  is high. the effectiveness of intervention in controlling epidemics in networks with low variance is high for moderately contagious influenza strains. however, for highly contagious influenza strains, the probability of an epidemic occurring and/or the final size of the epidemic does not depend on heterogeneity in the degree distribution, regardless of whether infection is predominantly transmitted via close or casual contacts. heterogeneous degree distributions can increase the infection attack rate  i.a.r.  of epidemics, which is produced by moderately effective transmission and targeted intervention. however, contact patterns will influence intervention success less, if intervention is targeted geographically rather than socially, as assumed in this investigation. the type of network and the population size have an effect on the probability of an epidemic occurring and/or the final size of the epidemic, but clustering is a negligible factor with respect to epidemiological outcomes in the networks studied here in the case of an influenza epidemic. however, it is not yet clear to what extent this effect is restricted to networks built on the basis of preferential attachment."
pmc6350949,"a study in the democratic republic of the congo  drc  found that at least some healthcare workers  hcws  have previous exposure or infection to ebola virus  ebov  based on serological evidence. the study's findings suggest that the prevalence of ebov exposure or infection among hcws and the general population in the region may be higher than previously reported. the study identified significant heterogeneity in ebov seroprevalence among hcws based on patient contact. the highest ebov glycoprotein  gp  seroprevalence was observed in the ""unlikely"" contact group, which may indicate endemic ebov exposure in the area. the study also found that 16  2.8%  of hcws who never reported infection were seroreactive for at least one ebov protein and may also have neutralizing capacity, suggesting that some seroreactive individuals could have been exposed to a non-ebov filovirus. the study highlights the need for additional research to better understand the roles that each ebov protein plays in immune response and the significance of ebov exposure and risk factors associated with these exposures to improve locally sustainable strategies to limit exposure of hcws to ebov and other pathogens. the study also underscores the need for providing adequate training of hcws to infection control procedures and availability of personal protective equipment to reduce exposure to bodily fluids of patients they treat before an ebov outbreak occurs, as limiting exposure of hcws to ebov and other blood-borne pathogens is ultimately one of the most important strategies to limit the spread of ebov and other pathogens."

pmc1762333,"in the study of societal learning and relaxation during the 2003 sars outbreak in singapore, one key finding is that the maximum likelihood estimate of the relaxation parameter in the learning rate model is extraordinarily close to one, indicating little evidence for relaxation in the learning rate for sars in singapore. another finding is that the mean removal rate probably does relax, but the data available to this study are too aggregated to make this inference conclusively. in the analysis of the effect of learning on transmission, a key finding is that the final size of an outbreak decreases rapidly with a modest investment in learning, and that the basic learning rate is 0.0066 d–1, with a 95% confidence interval of [0.0051, 0.0081]. in the discussion of the analysis with all data, one finding is that the distribution of average infectious period at the point where the outbreak was rapidly brought under control was highly dispersed, with a high variance and skewness. another finding is that the societal and economic costs of mistakenly declaring a state of emergency can be tremendous, but the costs of failing to intervene in a major preventable outbreak are probably small in comparison. in the study of learning and societal learning during the 2003 sars outbreak in singapore, a key finding is that one relatively uncertain data point was important to this analysis, but its importance, especially at the end of the data series, is not the first model to consider where such data are available, and it must instead be inferred from the information provided by the epidemic curve together with observations of the onset-of-symptoms to removal interval. in the study of the effect of learning on transmission, a finding is that the processes considered to contribute to learning include identifying the different activities that contribute to learning  a 0  and their costs, and that learning rates  and possibly relaxation  will vary geographically reflecting different societal conditions, research institutions, levels of emergency preparedness, etc. further, these phenomena may also differ depending on their similarity to diseases that are well understood or their resistance to laboratory isolation and characterization."

pmc2386736,"the study presents a novel ubl-pla2 assay for monitoring the fractionation of whole-cell lysates, which allows for the simultaneous measurement of multiple isopeptidases and their associated substrates. this assay offers a significant advantage over existing methods, as it enables the monitoring of relative isopeptidase activity in a high-throughput format, which is critical for the identification and validation of new isopeptidase inhibitors. the study demonstrates the utility of the ubl-pla2 assay for monitoring the fractionation of whole-cell lysates, as it enables the quantification of isopeptidase activity in a high-throughput format. this is significant because it allows for the rapid and efficient screening of large compound libraries for new isopeptidase inhibitors, which can facilitate the discovery of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases associated with aberrant isopeptidase activity. the study presents a detailed characterization of the ubiquitin ligase e3 ubiquitin-like protein  ulbp  as an isopeptidase substrate. the study shows that ulbp can be modified by the addition of ubiquitin-like proteins, which leads to the recruitment of the isopeptidase system and the deubiquitination of ulbp by isopeptidases. the study demonstrates the ability of the isopeptidase system to selectively deubiquitinate specific substrates, such as ulbp, and suggests a potential role for isopeptidases in the regulation of ulbp activity. this is significant because it provides insight into the function of the isopeptidase system in regulating the activity of specific substrates, which can facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diseases associated with aberrant isopeptidase activity. the study presents data on the dose-dependent activity of various isopeptidases, such as ubiquitin-specific processing proteases  usps  and isopeptidases associated with the n-end rule pathway, as well as the enhancement of usp5 activity in the presence of monoubiquitin. these findings provide a better understanding of the specific roles of these isopeptidases in the regulation of substrate"
pmc4451905,"a significant proportion of study participants in lower saxony, germany, during the 2014 ebola epidemic in west africa demonstrated poor knowledge about the transmission modes of ebola virus and about the actual risks in a european country. increased media use was not associated with better knowledge about ebola transmission routes among study participants. study participants with poor knowledge about ebola transmission routes and misperceptions about transmission routes, such as the airborne route, were more likely to report strong worries about ebola and to exhibit inappropriate and unjustified attitudes. a large majority of study participants supported compulsory vaccination against ebola for persons in affected countries, and about half also supported compulsory vaccination against ebola for the general population in germany, should the number of cases increase. however, during the 2014 ebola epidemic in west africa, inappropriate or unjustified attitudes were not demonstrated by most study participants, and the treatment of flown-in ebola patients in a nearby hospital would trigger inappropriate behavioral changes."

pmc3396893,"a study of vampire bat rabies virus  rv  transmission in peru found that rv is maintained regionally in bat populations over multiple years and is possibly mediated through frequency dependent transmission with a key role for juvenile and sub-adult bats. the study also found that there is no evidence for population thresholds for rv invasion and maintenance, consistent with the observed inefficacy of culling to eliminate viral circulation in bats and transmission to humans and domestic animals. future studies should identify the mechanistic basis for the relationship between culling and seroprevalence and use that information to inform epidemiological models of optimal rabies control in latin america. the study suggests that properly managed culling of vampire bats benefits agriculture through alleviating bat bites on livestock and possibly by reducing the total number of infected bats. however, the apparent positive effect of culling on seroprevalence, coupled with demographic and behavioral responses that might increase the proportion of susceptible bats, could have counterproductive consequences for rv transmission."

pmc3929004,"emerging infectious diseases  eids  are defined as those that have increased in incidence within the past two decades or have the potential to do so in the near future, due to the spread of a new agent, recognition of an infection previously undetected, or realization that an established disease has an infectious origin. zoonotic eids are a major concern, as over 60% of known human pathogens are transmitted to humans from animals, and 73% of emerging infections are zoonotic. the majority of established strictly human pathogens also have zoonotic origins and have fully adapted to humans over many millennia of human and pathogen evolution. the human-animal interface presents a risk for eid emergence, as almost all now-established strictly human pathogens have zoonotic origins. the human environmental and interpopulation interactions have undergone profound and distinct transitions throughout history, leading to changes in the local pathogen spectrum and the spread of eids. the current transition, characterized by globalization, urbanization, and climate change, is reshaping the relations between humans and microbes. the species jump that initiates a first human infection by a new agent is often brought about by cultural, social, behavioral, or technological change, and the subsequent spread of the infection depends on various biological, social, and environmental drivers of eid emergence."

pmc2880817,"advancements in molecular diagnostic tools have led to the identification of over 200 distinct strains of human rhinovirus  hrv , the main cause of common colds and a major trigger of asthma exacerbations. one newly discovered hrv strain, hrv-c, has been associated with asthma onset and exacerbations in both children and adults. the use of molecular diagnostic tools has also revealed that hrv infections are more prevalent in infants than previously thought, with up to 90% of infants experiencing at least one hrv infection by age 1. hrv-c is particularly common in infants, with up to 90% of infants experiencing at least one hrv-c infection by age 1. hrv-c infections in early childhood have been associated with asthma onset and exacerbations, and this suggests that hrv-c may be a ""asthmagenic"" virus strain. host factors, such as lower lung volumes at birth, particularly in those born prematurely, and genetic factors, may increase susceptibility to hrv-c infections and asthma exacerbations. environmental factors, such as exposure to allergens and air pollution, may also interact with hrv-c infections and increase the risk of asthma exacerbations. preventative and therapeutic interventions, such as inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene antagonists, can reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations by 40% to 50%. however, the mechanism for this reduction in risk is not fully understood, and further exploration is needed. studies of differentiated human epithelium or organ culture of lung or sinus tissue may provide important insights into the mechanisms that link respiratory allergies to virus-induced wheezing and asthma, as well as into the role of host factors and environmental and lifestyle factors in these processes. continued advances in microarray technology, genome-wide association studies, systems biology, and other high-throughput technologies provide important avenues for future investigations into the complex interplay of host, viral, developmental, and environmental factors in respiratory tract infections"

pmc5625316,"a conceptual framework for understanding a reservoir of infection has been established through various studies that have emphasized different aspects of zoonotic diseases. this framework focuses on the annotation of a target group, which is an explicitly defined population of interest in a dynamic and heterogeneous landscape, and all other susceptible populations that directly or indirectly connect epidemiologically to the target group. for a non-target population to be considered an accepted functional reservoir, maintenance of a single pathogen in the population needs to be shown in combination with a feasible transmission route between the target and non-target populations. according to haydon et al., a functional orientation of the presented framework allows for straightforward application but does not negate more complex populations. the same principles can be applied to multi-species systems and metapopulations. the defined target group may be adjusted based on interest and may therefore include metapopulations. the simplicity and functional orientation of the presented framework allows for straightforward application but does not negate more complex populations. the same principles can be applied to multi-species systems and metapopulations. according to the accepted definition of a reservoir proposed by haydon et al., two parts are discussed in order to demonstrate the requirements in two parts  the pathogen’s maintenance in a potential population followed by a discussion on proof of a feasible transmission route. owing to the functional orientation of the requirements and for simplicity, all entities involved in the biological lifecycles of a parasite  for example, primary and intermediate hosts  should be considered a single functional unit. appropriate sequence and functional analysis of a pathogen isolated multiple times from a potential reservoir should be required to prove that a pathogen is maintained in a population. the ability to quickly and cheaply sequence whole genomes has allowed for better genetic resolution. however, mutation rates vary significantly between pathogens, and the threshold for sequence and functional similarity must be individually defined and accepted by the scientific community. for example, the bacterium treponema pallidum  which causes syphilis in rabbits , is over 99% identical on the basis of the whole genome to the human pathogen t. pallidum  which causes human treponematosis , but does not provide sufficient evidence for the involvement of a pathogen and its ability to infect both groups. therefore, proof that a pathogen can"
